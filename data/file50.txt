500006 los jefes de polic a no debieran inmiscuirse en los asuntos de los dem s cuando se trata de su vida personal es inapropiado
500007 la tasa de cambio hace atractivas las importaciones porque hay que pagar menos pesos por cada d lar que se consigue por ejemplo hoy la divisa est 600 pesos por debajo de la cotizaci n que tuvo a finales del a o anterior cuando estaba por encima de los 2 mil pesos
500008 este tema debe tratarse con cuidado la tasa de cambio no debe ser el nico motivo para importar pues se tienen que evaluar otras situaciones de mercado para lograr un verdaderos beneficio en las negociaciones

500020 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
500021 the second phase is iraq there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
500022 iraq behind us anthrax outbreaks pentagon hardliners press for strikes on saddam
500023 american investigators probing anthrax outbreaks in florida and new york believe they have all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack and have named iraq as prime suspect as the source of the deadly spores their inquiries are adding to what us hawks say is a growing mass of evidence that saddam hussein was involved possibly indirectly with the 11 september hijackers
500024 iraq needs oil revenue now more than ever as they try to rebuild their country
500025 the invasion of iraq was about oil but it didnt result in more oil or cheaper gas
500026 it resulted in war profiteering by oil companies who benefited by keeping iraqi oil off the market
500027 five years have passed since the united states led a military invasion into iraq and george bush declared a mission accomplished but americas proposed goals remain elusive iraqs fragile stability hinges on deals brokered with sunnis and shiites iraqis caught in the midst of open ended war struggle to survive
500028 i keep asking myself what justifies the enormous costs of this war and the wounds it has inflicted i am at a loss for an answer this is the story of war
500029 they the bomb squad are investigating the office where the explosion occurred was not manned and so far there is no indication that anyone was injured
500030 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realisation of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
500031 troops crossed the district borders between mannar and kilinochchi districts at an undisclosed location
500032 at least 30 sla soldiers were killed and more than 60 troopers sustained injuries in an intense fighting three dead bodies of sla soldiers were also recovered by the tigers
500033 ltte terrorists attacked stf special task force who were conducting search operation at pothuwil in ampara stf officers have retaliated immediately
500034 since the increase in attacks against uk forces two months ago a 24 strong sas team has been working out of basra to provide a safety net to stop the bombers getting into the city from iran
500035 the aim is to identify routes used by insurgents and either capture or kill them
500036 suspects who attempted to commit a wilful act of murder
500037 whatever their mission they have no right to fire intentionally on anyone let alone a security man whose job is to protect this country
500038 all british troops in iraq come under the jurisdiction of britain
500039 had examined almost every single serious allegation of abuse of iraqi civilians by british troops
500040 the cases of the fusiliers convicted of abusing prisoners at camp breadbasket near basra and a paratrooper who has been charged in connection with the death of baha mousa a hotel receptionist
500041 several media reports and eyewitness accounts suggested that the sas operatives were disguised as al qaeda terrorists and were planning to set off the bombs in basras central square during a major religious event
500042 was meant to explode in the centre of the city of basra
500043 we believe these soldiers were planning an attack on a market or other civilian targets
500044 if allegations that the soldiers car was loaded with explosives are proved this will strengthen the theory suggesting that british and american intelligence are involved in the persistent and violent acts of terror spreading across iraq which means that the current counterinsurgency efforts involve the premeditated killing of innocent civilians to achieve us policy objectives
500045 several members of the iraqi police who were believed to be responsible for torturing prisoners at the notorious jamiyat prison in basra
500046 was compromised on september 19 when the sas team became involved in a shoot out with four plain clothed police officers just as they were about to withdraw from the surveillance operation
500047 apparent disagreements between british military commanding officers and the military police officials dispatched to the war theater in charge of investigating the actions and behavior of military personnel
500048 lord goldsmith revealed that he felt it necessary to move the case to the civilian jurisdiction and said sgt roberts case was one example of why top commanders might not be trusted to handle murder investigations
500049 developed by the ira using technology passed on by the security services in a botched sting operation more than a decade ago
500050 the bombs and the firing devices used to kill the soldiers as well as two private security guards were initially created by the uk security services as part of a counter terrorism strategy at the height of the troubles in the early 1990s
500051 according to investigators examining past collusion between the security forces and paramilitaries in northern ireland members of the shadowy army undercover outfit the force research unit and officers from mi5 learned in the early 1990s that a senior ira member in south armagh was working to develop bombs triggered by light beams
500052 the thinking of the security forces was that if they were intimate with the technology then they could develop counter measures thereby staying one step ahead of the ira a senior source close to the inquiry explained
500053 unfortunately no one could see back then that this technology would be used to kill british soldiers thousands of miles away in a different war
500054 details of one of the bombing team and the mans car registration
500055 the force research unit an ultra secret wing of british military intelligence
500056 mixed explosive and helped to develop new types of bombs
500057 light sensitive bombs activated by photographic flashes to overcome the problem of ira remote control devices having their signal jammed by army radio units
500058 a member of the provisional iras internal security squad also known as the torture unit which interrogated and executed suspected informers
500059 allowed him to carry out large numbers of terrorist murders in order to protect his cover within the ira
500060 the word on the street in baghdad is that the cessation of suicide car bombings is proof that the cia was behind them why because as one man states cia agents are too busy fighting now and the unrest they wanted to cause by the bombings is now upon them true or not it doesnt bode well for the occupiers image in iraq
500061 it looks like al qaeda its got all the hallmarks it was suicidal it was spectacular and it was symbolic
500062 all that we can be certain of is that this is something that came from outside carter said
500063 car bombs that are either being remotely detonated or maybe time bombs
500064 people from the area claim that the man was taken away not because he shot anyone but because he knew too much about the bomb rumor has it that he saw an american patrol passing through the area and pausing at the bomb site minutes before the explosion soon after they drove away the bomb went off and chaos ensued he ran out of his house screaming to the neighbors and bystanders that the americans had either planted the bomb or seen the bomb and done nothing about it he was promptly taken away
500065 to report to an american military camp near baghdad airport for interrogation and in order to retrieve his license
500066 the driver did leave in a hurry but was soon alarmed with a feeling that his car was driving as if carrying a heavy load and he also became suspicious of a low flying helicopter that kept hovering overhead as if trailing him he stopped the car and inspected it carefully he found nearly 100 kilograms of explosives hidden in the back seat and along the two back doors the only feasible explanation for this incident is that the car was indeed booby trapped by the americans and intended for the al khadimiya shiite district of baghdad the helicopter was monitoring his movement and witnessing the anticipated hideous attack by foreign elements
500067 the same scenario was repeated in mosul in the north of iraq
500068 discovered that the spare tire was fully laden with explosives
500069 some media cited unidentified sources who said he may have died after u s forces tracked a target using a helicopter gunship but foreign affairs said its still investigating conflicting reports of the death u s officials have denied any involvement
500070 while filming the aftermath of a car bombing in mosul
500071 are thought to have been on a surveillance mission outside a police station in basra when they were challenged by an iraqi police patrol
500072 iraqi security officials variously accused the two britons they detained of shooting at iraqi forces or trying to plant explosives
500073 and was meant to explode in the centre of the city of basra in the popular market
500074 in their possession explosives and remote control devices as well as light and medium weapons and other accessories
500075 assault rifles a light machine gun an anti tank weapon radio gear and medical kit this is thought to be standard kit for the sas operating in such a theater of operations
500076 what our police found in their car was very disturbing weapons explosives and a remote control detonator
500077 given the large number of sunni led attacks against shia targets the emerging shia led attacks against sunnis and the extralegal abductions of arabs by kurdish authorities in kirkut one has to wonder whether the long feared iraqi civil war hasnt already begun
500078 civil war today is closer than any time before said hazim abdel hamid al nuaimi a professor of politics at al mustansiriya university in baghdad
500079 bring together cia and military covert action information warfare intelligence and cover and deception
500080 trained front line battalions that were accused of significant human rights abuses
500081 where he was involved in the hunt for pablo escobar the head of the medellin cocaine cartel
500082 there may be times when host country governments show passivity or indecision in the face of communist subversion and according to the interpretation of the us secret services do not react with sufficient effectiveness most often such situations come about when the revolutionaries temporarily renounce the use of force and thus hope to gain an advantage as the leaders of the host country wrongly consider the situation to be secure us army intelligence must have the means of launching special operations which will convince host country governments and public opinion of the reality of the insurgent danger
500083 well i suspect it is an authentic document i dont doubt it i never saw it but its the kind of special forces military operations that are described
500084 the helles family has become a military force and its members have been attacking abducting and even killing people we must put an end to their attacks on innocent citizens
500085 all attempts to convince them to hand suspects over have failed
500086 our judgement is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist terror group
500087 those who helped those who gave shelter and those who took part in the attack have been caught
500088 this individual draws a perfectly understandable sensation of contempt from the prime minister as from all citizens
500089 clearing up the mess left behind is a dirty job but someones got to do it
500090 and that someone should be the person who made the mess in the first place
500091 it is humiliating and no one likes to be embarrassed in public
500092 i think the idea will work for that reason alone i certainly dont want to be doing it again the coppers were nice about it and now ive thought about what it would be like for the people who clean it up ill find a gents mens restroom in the future
500093 the hope of change offered by the march 29 presidential election has been ruthlessly and systematically crushed and all that remains is the stains of our butchered dreams
500094 i am now alone and i am angry because these people abused us and they have now left us to face the people that we tormented in the name of mugabe
500095 we are enveloped in the politics of hate the amount of hate that is being preached today in this country is frightful what zimbabwe fought for was peace progress love respect justice equality not the opposite and one of the worst evils we see today is corruption the country bleeds today because of corruption our country cannot progress on fear and false accusations which are founded simply on the love of power there is something radically wrong with our country today and we are moving fast towards destruction there is confusion and corruption and let us be clear about it we are seeing racism in reverse under false mirror of correcting imbalances from the past in the process we are creating worse things we have created fear in the minds of some in our country we have made them feel unwanted unsafe the fear that pervades the rulers has come down to the people and to the workers
500096 we are prepared to fight for our country and to go to war for it
500097 only step down to give way to someone from zanu pf who knows how to preserve our sovereignty
500098 go to state house over the dead bodies of zimbabweans
500099 no longer participate in this violent illegitimate sham of an election process
500100 to facilitate the holding of fresh elections under a new democratic constitution
500101 the campaign of violence and the restrictions on the political opposition have made it impossible for a free and fair election to take place
500102 did not represent the will of the people of zimbabwe
500103 the current atmosphere prevailing in the country did not give rise to the conduct of free fair and credible elections
500104 engage the broader political leadership in zimbabwe into a transitional negotiated settlement
500105 accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people
500106 for its representative to be protecting the horrible regime in zimbabwe
500107 out of touch with the trends in his own country
500108 has an increasing awareness that the eyes of the world are not only on zimbabwe but also on them
500109 to denounce the well documented post election attacks on our people
500110 the centrality and importance of african institutions in dealing with african problems
500111 with a view to creating a genuine viable permanent and sustainable solution to the zimbabwean situation
500112 take any decisions that have a bearing on the agenda of the dialogue
500113 will take all necessary measures to eliminate all forms of political violence including by non state actors and to ensure the security of persons and property
500114 shall refrain from using abusive language that may incite hostility political intolerance and ethnic hatred or undermine each other
500115 underwritten and guaranteed by the facilitator sadc and the au
500116 victory provided mugabe with clear signals that his support base in the region and the continent had declined
500117 consider pushing for multilateral sanctions targeting both zanu pf and the mdc to desist from violence
500118 accurately recording enumerating and analysing the data has been hampered by the risk of harassment from government agencies or those acting in the name of government
500119 impossible at times to find enough beds for hospital admission including space in intensive care
500120 humanitarian and social welfare organisations should be enabled to render such assistance as might be required
500121 today many who fled violence and economic turmoil in their own country and have sought refuge in south africa now find themselves under attack
500122 in less than one hour they destroyed my life look at my right hand it will never be strong again it will always hurt me and i will never work in the field the way i used to just less than an hour of beating and my life is ruined they must be arrested and then i can reconcile the police know who to arrest it is the base commander it is the zanu chairman it is others we all know who were behind the violence they must be arrested
500123 i have lost everything how can i go back in winter and live there with no blankets when the people who burnt down my house still live there and they have blankets i want compensation they must give me their things because i lost everything when they burnt my house my bed clothes pots i know who they are some of the ring leaders they are my neighbours how can i just go back and live there as if nothing happened aaah no i can go back but they must pay
500124 they said i got my money from mdc from britain and that is why they should burn it down
500125 you mean to just say sorry and that is all aah that is not going to be acceptable i will take revenge i want justice they must go to jail i want compensation just talking that is no good
500126 voting for tsvangirai is a vote for a return to war
500127 soldiers are not apolitical only mercenaries are apolitical we should stand behind our commander in chief if you have other thoughts then you should remove that uniform
500128 we wonder whom mr tsvangirai is running away or hiding from we do not have any complaints from him or his party of any threat of violence or attempts on his life that would cause him to fear for his safety and seek sanctuary in a foreign embassy

500139 we have observed that some people leading the violence are foreigners because they speak a different language and they do not understand our local languages also the tactics they are using are not peculiar to zimbabwe because they are cutting out the tongue removing eyes and genital parts we are not sure where they come from
500140 maybe i am pregnant or maybe i have hiv now no one can help
500141 zimbabwean women face hiv risk following rape as political violence
500142 if someone wanted to get the most bang for their buck they probably wouldnt go to truro

500147 the commonwealth argued extensively that the murderer wore these clothes

500151 i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
500152 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke is or whether that arm can reach me here
500153 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
500154 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
500155 that was my specific reference and if karadzic is in the hague and is still scared that i have an arm that long i guess i should treat it in a backhanded way as a compliment
500156 yeah you blocked him and he got beat up by a woman
500157 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith

500171 the health food industry is growing constantly and i think we are taking a piece of the pie from big pharma
500172 the bill is worded in ways that will allow them to have more control then they are letting on

500174 thats not great for business being in a small area that would definitely hurt
500175 70 translation therefore the book of daniel existed in documented form almost three centuries before christ was born
500176 seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy place daniel 9 24
500177 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times
500178 rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass zechariah 9 9
500179 i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out luke 19 40
500180 and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined daniel 9 26
500181 for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation luke 19 43 44
500182 let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also
500183 alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacobs trouble but he shall be saved out of it
500184 for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be
500185 and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints
500186 and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
500187 we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain
500188 your god whom you constantly serve will himself deliver you
500189 i reported more than a year ago and repeated in this years predictions that apple would be adding h 264 hardware support to its entire line of computers the chip they are adding comes from ntt in japan and was developed in cooperation with japanese broadcaster nhk the chips began sampling a year ago and should now be available in volume though apple may be paying as much as 50 each for early production the ntt chip is not just an h 264 decoder it encodes too which is what makes it so special the last i heard nhk was claiming the chip could compress a 1080p video and audio stream into four megabits per second down from the 20 megabits normally required if we assume apple will apply the same kind of wink wink nudge nudge transcoding to 1080p that theyve already applied to 720p in the apple tv then it is within reason to expect theyll claim to distribute 1080p over itunes in two megabits per second
500190 you are hard to be with and even harder to get over
500191 being with you is like war you throw everything you have and leave nothing for later
500192 whenever ones identity and social order face the possibility of destruction there is a natural tendency to feel angry frustrated helpless and or hurt the volatile reactions of terror hatred resentment and jealousy are often experienced as emotional manifestations of these feelings

500198 ananias how is it that satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the holy spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land 4didnt it belong to you before it was sold and after it was sold wasnt the money at your disposal what made you think of doing such a thing you have not lied to men but to god
500199 you are worthy our lord and god to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they were created and have their being
500200 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him
500201 my father is always at his work to this very day and i too am working
500202 i have much more to say to you more than you can now bear but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears and he will tell you what is yet to come he will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you all that belongs to the father is mine that is why i said the spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you revelation 1 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him to show his servants what must soon take place he made it known by sending his angel to his servant john that god was reconciling the world to himself in christ not counting mens sins against them and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation matthew 1 21 she will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name jesus because he will save his people from their sins
500203 we no longer believe just because of what you said now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world
500204 i have much more to say to you more than you can now bear
500205 but what does it say the word is near you in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith which we are preaching that if you confess with your mouth jesus as lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved for with the heart a person believes resulting in righteousness and with the mouth he confesses resulting in salvation

500224 eric clapton is extremely sorry to disappoint his numerous russian fans but the circumstances of the cancellation are completely beyond his control
500225 the cancellation of the concert is formally connected with a change of the venue for the show we originally considered two variants near the spassky gate and on the vasilyevsky spusk both are situated on red square the permission was issued for the vasilyevsky spusk and not actually red square the artist used the situation to cancel the show he did not like the fact that his performance was not going to be held on the square itself although the vasilyevsky spusk is legally a part of it most likely clapton had some other reasons for that decision

500279 the resistance is now stronger than before and this keeps the option of war awake if we were weak israel would not hesitate to start another war

500281 we are proud of our friendship with iran and with syria and every country which helps us to gain our rights
500282 all parties in lebanon are getting weapons no one asks from where
500283 i doubt that israel will attack iran because they know the consequences
500284 the hezbollah has doubled or tripled the amount of missiles it has in the last two years
500285 israel didnt achieve any of its goals the known goal of israel is death to hezbollah hezbollah is still here
500286 this is a clear declaration that lebanon is keen on maintaining the sources of its force
500287 there is no need to fear its strength or the strength of its resistance which liberated the land and the detainees
500288 right of lebanon its people army and resistance to liberate or reclaim its land
500289 this right is to be practiced under the state wing
500290 we see that the resistance is being cooperative with the lebanese army the resistance enjoys total freedom in defending the land and resisting israel
500291 we have overcome the past and our dealing today is based on partnership
500292 i think we have set important points in the policy statement and on which we can build something
500293 that seeks to be an independent state within the lebanese state in order to control the whole state

500332 i think it was great that he came out today a lesser person would not have come out but he did and we cant wait to get him back
500333 i know hes extremely remorseful and he understands but if we want to be a good football team we have to win without him
500334 i thought he didnt like to be called pacman anymore you said pacman pacman jones
500335 hes just trying to decide if hes going to play or not on the face of it thats the issue
500336 the longer that takes i guess increases the possibility of him not playing
500337 i guess if we keep it all in perspective there hasnt been any real hockey trades to my knowledge since july 1 and i dont think there will be until teams go through the arbitration process and have a clear understanding of what their financial obligations are
500338 i knew there would be a grace period where not a whole lot would happen in the nhl and were in the middle of that period

500360 our forces are capable of taking over the security in all iraqi provinces within a year and a half
500361 take over the security portfolio entirely and keep some sic multinational forces only in a supporting role
500362 within three to six months our need for the american troops will dramatically go down
500363 if our people return and take back this lost land its a success
500364 if we are killed trying to do so we have received martyrdom and this will be a great success for us too if we are thrown out of kandahar we will go to the mountains and start the guerrilla war as we did with the russians
500365 even with the system of permits even with the limits of movement to south africa we never had as much restriction on movement as i see for the people here
500366 there are areas in which people would live their whole lifetime without visiting because its impossible
500367 while i want to be careful not to characterise everything that i see here as apartheid i just do find comparisons in a number of places i also find differences
500368 the issue of separate roads different registration of cars driven by different nationalities the indignity of producing a permit any time a soldier asks for it and of waiting in long queues in the boiling sun at checkpoints just to enter your own city i think is worse than what we experienced during apartheid
500369 the daily indignity to which the palestinian population is subjected far outstrips the apartheid regime and the effectiveness with which the bureaucracy implements the repressive measures far exceed that of the apartheid regime
500370 this is ridiculous why are they arresting our guides and leaving the man with the megaphone
500371 these provocations didnt come from us im jewish and i look at this and i say to myself how can i feel fear from other jews
500372 as you walk into yad vashem you see a quote that says in effect you should know a country not only by what it does but what it tolerates
500373 so i found it very shocking to then come and here and see footage of teenagers heaping abuse on palestinian children as they come out of school and throwing stones at them and that this should be done in the name of judaism i find totally reprehensible
500374 what the holocaust teaches us more than anything else is that we must never turn our heads away in the face of injustice
500375 the level of social control ive seen here separate roads different number plates between palestinian and israeli cars may well be more cynically pernicious than what we have ever had but this is a country that is really about how there is going to be divorce and we were always a marriage
500376 new and small movement of palestinian israeli joint non violent struggle
500377 i completely understand the fears of israelis but at the same time we have seen for ourselves and been told about all sorts of measures that dont seem to be in terms of security and in some instances could if anything undermine security of state
500378 tell me what you gon do to get free we need more than mcs we need hueys and revolutionaries

500391 settlement has been reached for the sum of 2 83m in relation to the iraqi claims by the family of baha mousa who was murdered by british troops in september 2003 in basra and in relation to the torture and abuse of nine other iraqis
500392 the compensation is for the children of baha mousa and the pain and suffering suffered by the men at the hands of the british army during the mediation an apology was given by general viggers where he said the british army apologise for the appalling treatment that you suffered at the hands of the british army the appalling behaviour of british soldiers made us feel disgusted
500393 the ministry of defence and leigh day amp co solicitors are pleased that an amicable settlement has been reached with respect to claims by a group of iraqi citizens
500394 the settlement was accompanied by an apology from the ministry of defence
500395 all but a handful of the more than 120 000 british troops who have served in iraq have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour displaying integrity and selfless commitment
500396 the army has done a great deal since these cases to improve procedures and training but we are not complacent and continue to demand the very highest standards of conduct from all our troops
500397 our clients have been through hell over the past few years and this settlement will go some way to enabling our clients to have some semblance of a decent future life
500398 there were all sorts of lurid rumours about her being kidnapped

500405 im deeply outraged and disappointed in reverend jacksons reckless statements about senator barack obama
500406 divisive and demeaning reverend jackson is my dad and ill always love him but i thoroughly reject and repudiate his ugly rhetoric he should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself
500407 to decrease infiltrations by terrorists from the judea and samaria areas for the purpose of attacks in israel
500408 its construction does not reflect a political border or any other border
500409 the fence will have implications for the future border this is not the reason for its establishment but it could have political implications
500410 there was nothing here when we first came to this street
500411 to my mind we have got to have it we have no other option
500412 this is now israel and it wont go back it cant go back
500413 the enclave creates a chokehold around the villages it seriously damages the entire fabric of life
500414 its quite obvious that alfe menashe cannot be bargained over
500415 the people here dont feel like settlers they moved here not for political reasons but for quality of life at a reasonable price
500416 i saw the complete land of israel as something you should die for
500417 over many years you change your opinions and concepts according to the changing reality
500418 i definitely think our right to the west bank is a historical given right the fact that the palestinians have been living there for 100 years or so doesnt give them the edge over us
500419 for israel a unilateral division is also not a solution because it is not going to be accepted by the palestinians you cannot have a palestinian state with all these enclaves where they dont get their full lands back
500420 i dont agree with settlements that put up a single hut in the middle of nowhere and have 40 soldiers to guard it
500421 we are in israel we are not in the west bank as they say i dont consider myself a settler im an immigrant
500422 i have to tell all these people theyve been refused and theres nothing i can do about it i just tell people not to give up and to try again
500423 and in the end if they cannot get to their land their crops will die
500424 obviously the barrier can create some difficulties for those who live there whether jews or arabs but we have to see human life as the number one priority and since it saves human life we find this important
500425 i really cant explain what theyre trying to achieve by doing this
500426 it is occupation in the true sense of the word and of course it also affects us economically we were living from this land once
500427 its a policy of confiscating our land and pushing us to migrate away
500428 but the harder they make it the more we will stay
500429 this question really makes me worry about the future after all this time they keep finding new ways to deprive us of our permits
500430 if jayyus loses more than 70 of its land this means you ask the jayyus people to emigrate and get out of the village because you cant continue
500431 if we lose this land and these farms how can we resist how can we survive how can we go on and they talk about peace

500446 ele um garoto talentoso e de muita habilidade estou certo de que ele empolgar todos os nossos f s
500447 os mecanismos para a libera o de passes transfer ncias de clubes e o tempo de v nculo do jogador com o clube nas categorias de base
500448 estamos em contato com o werder e o jogador gostaria de ir para bremen
500449 ele me lembra o rudi v ller quando era jovem
500450 coldest winter i ever spent was a summer in san francisco
500451 beautiful girl you hair is so beautiful let me show you something
500452 i cant talk i just received some very bad news
500453 for 20 bucks will someone get in the apple line for me within the hour
500454 the ghost map the story of londons most terrifying epidemic and how it changed science cities and the modern world
500455 think it has its quirks and points where it fails outright
500456 people probably dont even listen to the jokes if they are busy accumulating their emotional state on a twitter stream
500457 that would be pretty intense if apple limited a crucial feature exclusively to users of a microsoft product
500458 i believe the wii of the handheld market is called the nintendo ds the ds doesnt have accelerometers but
500459 would i even like that guy would i want to sit down and have a beer with him
500460 ah that first feeling of summer in the northeast i love that
500461 this collection is a brief amalgamated sampling of american life as seen through my lens a survey of music art human rights activism and hot rod culture seemingly unrelated but actually connected in numerous ways its part of an ongoing multi decade chronicle of our times which in certain respects aspires to illustrate the ongoing influence of the cultural fringe on mainstream culture and offers proof of connections where most people would assume there were none
500462 computers used to take up entire buildings now they just take up our entire lives
500463 so how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire and the honest answer is this you wont and accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience
500464 i am honored that my colleagues from across the country have asked me to serve as vice chairman of the national lieutenant governors association this year
500465 i look forward to working with them to continue the good work nlga has done in the past and help direct the associations attention toward some of the most important issues currently facing virginia and other states
500466 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
500467 if you had asked me about my chances before the judge ruled id have had a neutral response
500468 my family and i didnt know where to turn who to contact
500469 we were sitting there talking and the next thing you know i reached up and choked jennifer
500470 i did this on my own without any prior discussion with dustin turner he did not encourage me in any way and in fact i remember one instance while i was choking jennifer dustin trying to pull my hands away
500471 were always concerned about what the other side has to say against us
500472 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
500473 my most anger has been toward billy brown he murdered an innocent young lady and sent me to prison and upset countless lives but im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred
500474 perhaps when i walk out these gates itll be a different story
500475 this morning i heard senator obama on television say that is going to be people like you that are going to determine the outcome of the race people that are angry and this morning i also heard him say why is john mccain concentrated on paris hilton and britney spears your testimony makes his ads all the more ridiculous
500476 i hope this year it is going to be people like you that are not going to vote against your economic interest again because it is you who are going to determine the outcome of what we are going to do in this country about health care job wages and things that matter to you
500477 senator clinton often talked about during the campaign about working americans being invisible to the previous administration and you have given them a voice
500478 our good paying and respectful job are being sent to mexico so employers can avoid paying decent wages and benefits
500479 it is crazy to me that john mccain has pledged to support every trade deal under the sun knowing how much it has hurt my family and others like this i want to say that a visit to bloomington would change his mind but he keeps going to our communities like ours and saying the same thing that jobs arent coming back and he supports free trade at any cost
500480 a lot of people are working low wage jobs with no job security john mccain supports free trade deals that have created this miserable economy leaving so many hard working americans between a rock and hard place
500481 i could never vote for senator mccain on issue after issue
500482 we just can not survive another republican president like mr bush or senator mccain who supports bad trade deals privatizing social security
500483 i havent heard any long term solutions for lowering gas prices from him either i really do think that mr obama is the best candidate and is going to lead us in a new direction for the next 4 years
500484 there are going to be a lot of jobs if we decide to do what we are talking about doing which is reduce our dependency on foreign oil and truly develop an economy that is based on innovation in green energy renewables and the ability to do things as in a lot those areas in terms of from the inside management there is a whole host of jobs that cant be exported to china
500485 theres progress being made i wouldnt say as much as id like at this point so were going to continue to push him
500486 i think pushing him back into two a days will help him as well
500487 being on liberty with john mccain was like being in a train wreck
500488 learned to fly at pensacola though his performance was below par at best good enough to get by he liked flying but didnt love it
500489 flying too low over the iberian peninsula he took out some power lines which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral
500490 in the fall of 1974 mccain was transferred to jacksonville as the executive officer of replacement air group 174 the long sought flying billet at last a reality a few months later he assumed command of the rag which trained pilots and crews for carrier deployments the assignment was controversial some calling it favoritism a sop to the famous son of a famous father and grandfather since he had not first commanded a squadron the usual career path
500491 off duty usually on routine cross country flights to yuma and el centro john started carousing and running around with women to make matters worse some of the women with whom he was linked by rumor were subordinates at the time the rumors were so widespread that true or not they became part of mccains persona impossible not to take note of
500492 to washington as the number two man in the navys senate liaison office
500493 late afternoon gathering spot where senators and staffers usually from the armed services and foreign relations committees would drop in for a drink and the chance to unwind
500494 das war die richtige reaktion die man als trainer gefordert hat
500495 nasa should be at the forefront in the collection of scientific evidence and debunking the current hysteria over human caused
500496 james hansen is a political activist who spreads fear even when nasas own data contradict him
500497 we have got to move away from these beautifully choreographed speeches which appeal to groups of voters who are unassailably in the obama camp already
500498 what plays well with the educated liberal voter sometimes grates with the blue collar folk whom we need on our side if we are going to win
500499 even on his worst day bill clinton was able to signal that he understood voters concerns and that he felt their pain
500500 obama has no trouble with the campaign stagecraft but this isnt harvard its the beer hall he has to talk in language that people understand
500501 do you have a boss and work for wages then you are working class period
500502 middle class is a ruling class construct used to divide us
500503 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
500504 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
500505 suppose they open up to foreign investment and production goes up 1 2 million barrels a day after a few years its 5 to 10 times mccains offshore drilling
500506 avoid discussing your childs progress or other irrelevant topics with the teacher during the trip
500507 teachers usually have in their mind exactly what the roles of the parents should be
500508 my son and two others in his class are allergic to nuts and peanuts one child has diabetes the school is liable for these kids and has a strict policy because of these childrens school medical plans
500509 you have to identify which kid is going to be the one most likely to wander off break something hurt someone else or come home covered in mud you can shadow that kid a little bit more than the other ones
500510 get up close to the face of the offending child and calmly but firmly tell them they should not be sticking gum on someones hair
500511 it used to be that kids had play shoes and dress shoes but today theyre wearing sneakers for all kinds of occasions its more of an everyday fashion statement
500512 they were pink and blue very feminine and you couldnt tell they were sneakers
500513 most of what we see in the kids market are pull downs from adults
500514 for me the litmus test is can you run in it comfortably
500515 if theyre doing their duty by wearing a dress or a button down shirt let them have their sneakers
500516 at some level a dress code is there to set a tone in school
500517 teachers have better things to do than debate whether a shoe is a flip flop
500518 unless they say karen hall was found under the rubble of her house in wherever im living dont worry
500519 we want to have real representation for the iraqi teams and the iraqi supporters
500520 we all breathe the same air we all cherish our childrens future and we are all mortal
500521 ora o deus da paci ncia e da consola o vos conceda o mesmo sentir de uns para com os outros segundo cristo jesus para que concordemente e a uma voz glorifiqueis ao deus e pai de nosso senhor jesus cristo portanto acolhei vos uns aos outros como tamb m cristo nos acolheu para a gl ria de deus
500522 clouds come floating into my life no longer to carry rain or usher storm but to add color to my sunset sky
500523 ive had a face lift eye job and all that stuff it didnt help me one bit it didnt get me happier or make me look particularly younger
500524 what impressed you the most not missing or the 68 yarder
500525 i kind of liked the last one to be honest with you
500526 it was the first day he had everybody looking at him both in our field goal drills and the two minute drill he stepped up and did a fine job
500527 when you watch a guy kick off and he kicks it sometimes 10 yards out of the end zone his leg strength is probably up to 75 78 yards
500528 that would have been good at 73 or 74 yards right there every once in a while depending on what the situation is a guy gets a chance to attempt one of those but usually its at the end of a half or the end of a game
500529 it felt good to just show the team that i can do it and give them some confidence in me so in the game when i do have a chance to have a game winner they expect me to make it and they are not thinking flip a coin
500530 i maybe got a little bit more confidence out of the team and a little more confidence in myself
500531 i still have to do it in the game there will still be some questions but hopefully i get the opportunity and do well in the game
500532 i didnt even know we were going to go back that far today
500533 it wasnt in the script we went back to 68 yards i just tried to keep it straight and it went through
500534 trickle down hell yeah that sounds great id like a trickle from your fountain of wealth just as long as i can keep my guns and that lady over there cant get an abortion its a deal
500535 another reason people vote republican is because they just arent as stupid as you liberals think they are
500536 not one thing yip says in his rant is true
500537 class talks about the kkk but yet there is an active kkk member in the us senate and hes a liberal democrat robert byrd
500538 sorry your democrat scare tactics dont work anymore people have gotten smarter
500539 they see how the dems in congress dont give a damn about people all they want to do is line their own pockets like democrat sen dianne feinstein
500540 and algore getting rich off the global warming scandal while he uses enough electricity to power hundreds of homes
500541 meanwhile the democrat lead congress approval rating is the lowest in american history single digits 9
500542 you guys may be like minded but there are far more people out there who think like i do and agree with me than whack job libs like you jeeniuses
500543 this month voters trust democrats more than republicans on seven out of ten electoral issues tracked rasmussen reports the republicans have managed to gain back some lost ground on national security and the war in iraq last month the democrats had the advantage on all ten key issues
500544 u kno it sherwood be nise if sumone came onto the websihgt and make evreeone pruve whut they are saying and make shure all the wurds are spelt kerectly
500545 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative city and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
500546 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
500547 what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
500548 our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics the group warned
500549 amply showed that they are scheming to sabotage the beijing olympic games
500550 the new robots arent nearly as good as you are andrew
500551 the new ones are contemptibly simple minded creatures as a matter of fact the company has always succeeded in learning how to make the pathways more precise more closely on the nose more deeply on the track but that is a double edged kind of improvement the new robots dont shift they have no mental agility theres nothing in the least unpredictable about them they simply do what theyre designed to do and never a smidgeon more i like you better andrew
500552 of course the company will tell you that their current generation of robots is 99 9 efficient or maybe theyre claiming 100 efficiency this year well good for them but a robot like you andrew youre 102 efficient 110 maybe that isnt what they want at u s robots theyre after perfection and i suppose theyve attained it their idea of perfection anyway the perfect servant the flawlessly functioning mechanical man but perfection can be a terrible limitation andrew dont you agree what it leads to is a kind of soulless automaton that has no ability to transcend its builders predetermined notions of its limitations not at all like you andrew you arent soulless thats obvious to us all by now
500553 if i cant answer question with a telepromter i will not debate
500554 our campaign isnt about keeping people out or thousand dollar a plate donor meetings behind closed doors our campaign stops are open to the public and the press regardless of who they favor come one come all is our motto
500555 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful
500556 but our commitment to nuclear power is clear and nuclear new build does not depend on one single deal
500557 edf was the governments get out of jail free card which hasnt materialised there are tough decisions to be made as the reality is britain will run short of power
500558 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realisation of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
500559 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
500560 we the 100 national and international ngo members of acbar express our grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
500561 some of us were lucky we had showers before got off the airplane
500562 the advantage that barack obama brings to the equation is that he doesnt have the rest of his party a significant wing of his party telling him to go slow or do nothing
500563 el m ximo y ltimo esfuerzo del gobierno para satisfacer la demanda de aumento de sueldos

500575 w e misidentified former congressman bill janklow as a democrat
500576 but then it started pouring and the wind really picked up it was scary ive seen hurricanes before but this was scary
500577 w e misidentified former congressman bill janklow as a democrat
500578 that can mean a three hour trip out of your day just to get the mail
500579 w e misidentified former congressman bill janklow as a democrat
500580 i s it inflammatory to say that aids and drugs are wrecking the black community because the white power structure wishes it no nor is it controversial it is wicked and stupid and false to say such a thing and it not unimportantly negates everything that obama says he stands for by way of advocating dignity and responsibility over the sick cults of paranoia and victimhood
500581 a review of what actually happened shows that the charges that the clintons played the race card were not simply false they were deliberately manufactured by the obama camp and trumpeted by a credulous and or compliant press corps in order to strip away her once formidable majority among black voters and to outrage affluent college educated white liberals as well as college students
500582 w e misidentified former congressman bill janklow as a democrat
500583 for a man who will turn 72 this month hes a surprisingly immature politician
500584 two men i think but its hard to tell they whisper
500585 no at least not yet they only speak to each other
500586 i can hear the words but they dont always make sense to me theyre only pieces of something much larger its as if im eavesdropping on a conversation that continues on later without me
500587 theyre not hostile and they seem to tolerate each other but i wouldnt say friendly no theyre more dispassionate than anything its as if theyre dissecting a corpse on an examining table
500588 yes perhaps i dont know would that be good or bad
500589 its neither good nor bad im just trying to understand
500590 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity
500591 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it
500592 es hat absolut keinen deal gegeben keine vereinbarung mit den chinesen
500593 ich entschuldige mich nicht f r etwas wof r wir nicht verantwortlich sind

500600 i only spend one percent of my time and my brain on who is buying and who is selling
500601 alibaba should be prepared for winter smes should prepare for the winter
500602 in every corner of the world you find chinese people in the future these people could use something like alipay or another technology to support the causes that are close to them
500603 let me be very clear on this we require the different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and i am adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
500604 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
500605 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
500606 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required it to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games the ioc required this and this is what bocog beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad has said it will deliver
500607 i am not going to apologize for something that we are not responsible for we are not running the internet in china the chinese are running the internet in china
500608 in the past we learned from the u s for 3g japan is bringing the new technology i think this will happen in the rest of the world
500609 in the future if you do not become number one in china you will not be the number one in the world

500632 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
500633 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
500634 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
500635 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
500636 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production

500644 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
500645 there are several things in there that will be hard to swallow
500646 the references to gene robinson the moratoria and the pastoral forum
500647 a good opportunity for gay people to feel better in gods mission in the church
500648 in our province we need to focus on other kinds of important issues like evangelism work with poor people and the immigrants

500650 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
500651 we are ending in a moment of frenzied attempts to make sense of all of it

500680 my fear that the blog was becoming too negative in tone i regard myself as a centrist i believe very much that in proper doses copyright is essential for certain classes of works especially commercial movies commercial sound recordings and commercial books the core copyright industries i accept that the level of proper doses will vary from person to person and that my recommended dose may be lower or higher than others but in my view and that of my cherished brother sir hugh laddie we are well past the healthy dose stage and into the serious illness stage much like the u s economy things are getting worse not better copyright law has abandoned its reason for being to encourage learning and the creation of new works instead its principal functions now are to preserve existing failed business models to suppress new business models and technologies and to obtain if possible enormous windfall profits from activity that not only causes no harm but which is beneficial to copyright owners like humpty dumpty the copyright law we used to know can never be put back together again multilateral and trade agreements have ensured that and quite deliberately

500689 i think that i would have preferred a gradual adjustment the fact that this is such a shock to american pocketbooks is not a good thing but if we take some steps right now to help people make the adjustment first of all by putting more money into their pockets but also by encouraging the market to adapt to these new circumstances more quickly particularly us automakers then i think ultimately we can come out of this stronger and have a more efficient energy policy than we do right now

500697 clark is sweating because she needs the bill soon and failure means a snap election when her party is so far behind in the polls she would much prefer to wait another four months and hope the gap narrows by the time the campaign starts
500698 we know what they are trying to do get rid of us before the election and in fact have a snap election now
500699 of course this ignores the fact that peters has built his career out of manipulating the media to destroy his enemies and he now appears to have been happily taking cheques from the same kind of big businessmen that he claims are out to get him

500772 based on our experience the overwhelming reason for the ccp to block a website is not because it may have harmful content such as pornography or excessive violence
500773 the main reason they block a website is because they are trying to cover up human rights abuses and other crimes carried out by the state so the real question here i think is why are they so afraid of journalists having free access to information about falun gong

500784 despite the way the cdc is spinning these new numbers which ahf has been calling for the public release of since last october there is absolutely no good news here without an accurate picture of the epidemic vastly underestimated for the past ten years we have missed countless opportunities to intervene with effective public health strategies the u s must immediately appropriate 200 million in order to test 10 million people over the next three years massive scale up of hiv testing is the only way to bring down these appalling numbers identifying all those who are infected and linking them to treatment is the only way to break the chain of new infections and begin to address the nations runaway epidemic

500888 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
500889 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
500890 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
500891 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who should be replaced and who should be appointed to which position
500892 in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
500893 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
500894 holbrooke strongly promised me that the hague tribunal would be history for karadzic if he withrdrew from politics forever

500966 madonna will be 50 years old in a few weeks and the internet is horrified that she looks something like a woman in her mid 40s the thing is blogs and message boards are populated by 26 year olds who have never seen a person older than 40 except their parents and parents look old to everyone t here is definitely a large contingent who believe that at some point a woman has to make a choice between her face and her body and that shes just old at her age the flesh slides off the bone like a well cooked chicken ha stick around kiddo

500970 thats the world we live in thats a fact of life everybody has a camera
500971 i tell all the protest groups that go out public places to have someone in their group with video camera
500972 just like a live witness any piece or source of evidence needs to be examined analyzed and challenged
500973 it is imperative to recognize that a photograph or video shows only one angle at a specific snapshot in time
500974 he was such a sweetheart i cannot think of anybody who would not miss him
500975 to anybody who knew him he was that bright bubbly happy guy he was always out for fun i already miss him
500976 if you come into my restaurant and order a steak and i throw it in a blender and give you a milkshake is that a steak
500977 i uh i didnt i thought cameron might be in here
500978 why would cameron be in my room wasnt she with you at the beach
500979 she was but when i woke up she was she was gone
500980 gone you sure she didnt just disappear for a few minutes to get an ice cream cone or something
500981 i waited for half an hour and then i searched the entire beach if she was there i wouldve found her
500982 of course i did used up all my credit trying to reach her
500983 yeah she gets a real kick out of torturing me its her favourite past time
500984 have you spoken to jas ethan maybe hes seen her
500985 what am i missing here who am i supposed to have seen
500986 cameron shes disappeared i was hoping you mightve seen her
500987 she wanted to know if her bikini was and i quote tight
500988 when was the last time you saw her you two went to the beach right
500989 yes we spent the night but when i woke up this morning she was gone and before you ask yes i have searched everywhere and i have tried calling her
500990 okay okay lets just put our heads together and try to figure out what mightve happened to her
500991 argh what now im trying to earn a living here man
500992 so much for that theory damn it i was kinda hoping shed drowned
500993 no i meant in regards to finding her if shed gone for a swim and gotten stuck somehow wed be able to locate and rescue her
500994 wait didnt you say once that kevin could always locate cameron that he had some kind of esp couldnt you use that to find her
500995 yes but it was an anomaly of sorts i cant just snap my fingers and instantly know where she is but if i were to somehow integrate myself into the citys surveillance systems i might be able to find her
500996 we can plug your chip into the grid like we did with cam and the traffic light cmon lets go
500997 thats the question isnt it did god send us here to suffer or were we always meant to be here
500998 thats not what i meant do you know why youre here instead of jail
500999 im guessing youre afraid that if you take me in theyll put me on a secure vehicle where ill be rescued again
501000 true true but i also want to talk to you about certain things that would otherwise be considered unrelated to your crimes does the name skynet mean anything to you
501001 okay what about judgment day nuclear apocalypse machines versus humans in an epic battle for survival any of this sound familiar what about robots from the future soldiers from the future does the name kyle reese ring any bells
501002 only what ive read from sarah connors case file he was a soldier from the future sent back to protect connor from a machine he called the terminator he apparently died trying to fight the machine do you know this man
501003 it matters to me because you see i recently had an encounter with one of these so called terminators
501004 if you had an encounter with a metal you wouldnt be sitting here sipping tea your brains would be splattered all over the floor
501005 and they very nearly were but it let me live for reasons i have yet to understand
501006 good for you maybe next time you wont be so lucky
501007 maybe cmon man tell me what its all about tell why these machines are here tell me what they want from us
501008 alright look in several years time some guy is gonna create a machine that declares war on mankind all of this will be bombed back to the stone age and those left over will be forced to fight a long and bloody war against the machines somewhere down the line skynet developed time travel and started sending machines back in time to ensure its creation some of them stockpile supplies others hunt down and kill people
501009 a lot more some of them are very good at blending in with other people
501010 sarah said that they were after her son why is that
501011 because hes the guy who leads us to victory hes the guy who taught humanity how to smash those metal fuckers all to hell
501012 they are here because of him hes the reason the machines have killed all these people
501013 but you said yourself they came back to kill him if he was dead they wouldnt need to come through time and do any of this
501014 of course not cos if john was dead wed be royally screwed and skynet would just wipe us all out
501015 and i heard as it were the noise of thunder and i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him
501016 ive considered that passage many times since my encounter with the machine and all the while i think to myself how can i stop these robots from destroying the here and now and i think i finally have the answer
501017 shes not dead look at me if she died id know instantly shes still alive but shes not in los angeles shes not in california and shes not on this continent
501018 i dont know but its safe to say that shes not anywhere in the united states im sorry john she could be anywhere in the world by now we may never find her
501019 ten ways to tick me off in a writing workshop
501020 tell me that since you are a mother you know how my mother characters should be portrayed a lot better than i do
501021 i told them both i wanted to try this and if it wasnt good for either one of them that i would have to make a decision so thats what we did
501022 it was kind of getting to both of them a little bit i just think that its better to do it this way
501023 a few years back we had a case where a 3rd party library had embedded jdom beta 8 into their jar but they did not change the package names when we tried updating our applications to jdom 1 0 we ran into conflicts because the old jdom was embedded into one of the jar files we needed this is exactly the kind of problem that jar jar links can eliminate
501024 the reason iowa city and coralville arent doing it specifically is because we are doing it in one request
501025 the accumulation of small things will eventually lead to big things
501026 if you continue not to do your assigned work you will inevitably fail man
501027 could at least give me time to clear away the dishes first
501028 i could always leave and come back if you want
501029 no seems like too much work and besides youll just track more mud in
501030 mhmm dont know how she navigates herself here but she does talked all about saving her soul today
501031 yes that bunk valiant religion tried to rope her in
501032 oi thats based on actual events cant say that about most religions
501033 well i think she learned a few things about herself today that she should be happy with exactly who she is
501034 thats just like you pressing atheism into my daughter how do you know i dont want to bring her up to worship the three sisters
501035 i think if you wanted to raise her up a certain way then you should actually act like shes your daughter
501036 oi i act like shes my daughter ask after her all the time
501037 yes yes you ask ever since you heard shes alive and visiting here youve asked but thats hardly the same as seeing her its hardly the same as putting forth the effort and making sure your ship lands at my doorstep the same time as hers
501038 four or five cubes depending on the way she feels
501039 she probably got the notion of sugar from you and the notion of very sweet from me
501040 someone offered her a cup somewhere and she learned she liked milk
501041 shes growing up without you for all you know shes never had honey in her tea no ones shown her
501042 its about living and learning and growing and shes doing that all on her own right now shes got just herself and her ambitions and do you really want that to be everything she has
501043 youre incorrigible you know that you have a child out there and shes living her life and youre content because she has an occasional friend she visits
501044 she could have a father you know a proper family
501045 yeah fat chance on that one sweetie lost my chance for that a long time ago
501046 are you ever going to tell me who she was
501047 so arent you going to ask me to come with you
501048 you can see her wait for her a little effort have yourself a family
501049 i know you cant stay for me but stay for her
501050 they dont always go just to watch the football theyll come to abuse me ill get the banter but ill enjoy that its probably going to be the best moment in my career
501051 the tremendous rivalry between the fans is only matched at places like manchester united and liverpool feelings were much fiercer on the terraces than the respective dressing rooms but to be fair that is only to be expected most supporters live in the same area all their lives while players come and go usually they havent grown up in the middle of arsenal spurs arguments
501052 we had a meeting last monday with gareth and his agent we all agreed we would have a 5pm deadline on wednesday and if liverpool had not proved they would proceed with the transfer then we would leave that aside
501053 the following morning we were upbeat on the strength of what had happened on wednesday we were buoyant and optimistic that everything could come back to normal again
501054 on thursday there was a meeting between gareths agent myself and the player they still felt that despite the deadline passing liverpool were still going to come in
501055 theyve got up to the normal window which is the 31st of this month its up to them ive decided this is the only way forward for us
501056 ja mit dem jetzigen abstand bin ich noch w tender ich denke dass der schiedsrichter uns verpfiffen hat

501060 the project which promised billions of rands in export and local sales has not happened
501061 a former south african official who had access to such information informed us in confidence that ferrostaal paid r30m to current president thabo mbeki to gain the arms contract in the first place
501062 when questioned by investigators in south africa mbeki claimed that r2m was given to his former deputy president jacob zuma and the rest went to the anc
501063 because mbeki maintains a tight rein on the national prosecuting authority where this matter would be dealt with
501064 of such fantastical proportions as not to warrant any response
501065 anyone can write a document and claim it is authentic
501066 anc leaders have now vowed that zuma will walk free no matter what evidence there is against him
501067 they are effectively saying that if you are powerful enough you are above the law
501068 more people have been killed in sa in the last five years than in the war in iraq
501069 the statistics no longer mean much they cannot express the pain that is felt by every south african who has lost a loved one to violent crime
501070 behind every statistic are human beings whose lives have been taken away or have been irredeemably changed forever
501071 this is what our government either does not understand or does not want to talk about

501093 former cuban leader fidel castro slammed edmonton thursday in an internet column addressing the two baseball players who defected during a junior tournament in the city
501094 the cuban athletes were badly taken care of that city has the privilege of hosting that championship every year we should analyze whether it is worth attending that tournament
501095 edmonton mayor stephen mandel is offering former cuban leader fidel castro a free trip to his city to see what a great place it is
501096 jason kenny the secretary of state for multiculturalism called castros comments
501097 edmonton is one of the most friendly dynamic and enterprising cities in the world
501098 like the rest of canada it embraces freedom democracy human rights and the rule of law
501099 if fidel castro spent more time embracing canadian values and less time criticizing them he wouldnt have to worry about people defecting from cuba

501128 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
501129 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism

501146 the people of the united states of america and the people of iowa are wise voting for barack obama for president of the united states leader of the free world and commander in chief is the political equivalent of bungee jumping

501280 blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked nor stands in the way of sinners nor sits in the seat of scoffers but his delight is in the law of the lord and on his law he meditates day and night he is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season and its leaf does not wither in all that he does he prospers the wicked are not so but are like chaff that the wind drives away therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the lord knows the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked will perish ps 1

501290 stephen harper has no mandate to run roughshod over democracy by aggressively pushing for bilateral trade deals that only benefit big business because he didnt get his way at the wto
501291 the wto talks failed for the same reason they have failed for seven years
501292 economic globalization led by the rich countries and their corporations and the notion of unlimited growth behind the wto is killing the world too many people and their governments are refusing to have these so called trade deals force fed to them by the worlds elite
501293 the world is running out of cheap energy and water policies and institutions that promote endless growth and trade must go the way of the dinosaurs
501294 the world also has a food crisis that has caused many poorer countries to turn to national food security policies while consumers around the world now want to buy and shop locally and sustainably the only way out of the ecological crisis the world faces is a different way of living where trade and the economy serve communities not the other way around and sustainable trade and economic policies must prevail
501295 the attempt by some to put a positive spin on the outcome of the doha talks in geneva by saying there were only some minor obstacles is patently absurd
501296 the global trade agenda has been on the brink since day one this is precisely because it has never been a balanced negotiation its been a series of bullying sessions to force the global south to concede to something that has never been in the interest of the majority of the people on the planet
501297 corporate globalization is a spent agenda multilateral trade deals have been resoundingly rejected by the majority of the world over the past ten years
501298 changing strategy from multilateral bullying to bilateral bullying is not the solution to the failed model embodied by the doha round its not in the interest of the global south and its not in the interest of canadians
501299 but then we go out on to the street and its a different story
501300 its not important if their reaction is positive or negative its about getting their feelings to come out were not here to force people to change their minds and dictate what is right and wrong there are many grey areas we jewish israelis have good guys and bad guys and so do they
501301 jews can go through their whole life in israel and never meet a palestinian
501302 so the camp is very eye opening for them for the palestinians its slightly different since they are forced to see the jewish side every day but on the camp we try to create a balanced environment in which they can meet their jewish peers
501303 people are ignorant and they prefer their ignorance to knowledge
501304 my parents are moderate and very supportive of me taking part and my sisters politics are the same as mine so we got into this group together
501305 everyone must be treated the same and no one group can be treated better than others
501306 it doesnt need to be a jewish state nor must preference be given to the jewish people it just needs to be our country a country belonging to both jews and arabs
501307 if we lose all hope there is nothing more to be done
501308 there is no change without hope and if we start with teenagers http www guardian co uk commentisfree 2008 may 06 theartoflivingtogether thats where we can have the most effect just watching their interaction with one another is the change we are trying to make
501309 we dont advocate policies such as where to draw borders and so on
501310 all we say is that both people have rights here and that they need to be treated equally
501311 but on the other hand its going to be a very long process to effect real change in israeli society in the meantime we can create more and more young activists at least

501313 regression from what is required to make a meaningful contribution to meeting the challenges of climate change
501314 rather than focusing as some environmentalists do on reducing the income and consumption of the rich world
501315 we should focus much more on raising the sustainability of the worlds technologies
501316 which will allow the world to continue to use low cost fossil fuels such as coal in a manner that does not wreck the climate
501317 air capture would allow humanity to reverse a previous rise of co2 by capturing and sequestering more carbon dioxide than is being emitted in any period put differently the best that can be achieved at a power plant is to stop new emissions with air capture we could put into reverse what weve done up to this point

501419 you expect me to concentrate on my work with that old harpy hanging around i came here to get away from her time leeching and what happened i wrote the fucking book in record time what does that tell you about dora

501472 anyway i thought this was supposed to be your vacation
501473 ok bill down boy you dont have to get all worked up youre still one of my favorite charges even if you have little latin and less greek
501474 and i am on my vacation a paid vacation a busmans holiday its wonderful i get to stay in maine for a few weeks and i get to work with one of my most interesting writers really
501475 chapter 8 is very problematic there is a sudden and dramatic change in voice what is the reason for this to what end come on bill faites attention you want more than a couple of 200 advances dont you
501476 now my friend this is some of the finest work youve ever done i am so terribly confident that wry beach will far excel choates castle so much more original yet grounded in a beautifully detailed historical and social setting that by 1960 i foresee another book of at least equal prowess
501477 well goddamn it youve been telling me for years that i gloss over my characters reactions and that i needed to put more on the page
501478 not to this extent all these italicized thought balloons enough already
501479 youre a success too honey you make a lot more money than harold
501480 hes the archetype of the assimilated jew far worse the painlessly assimilated jew people are amazed to discover that he
501481 ive noticed that harold is never the one to reveal his true identity
501482 as what superman orson welles donny it gives me the creeps how you harp on this purity of yours
501483 and now hes got that fair colleen of a wife and the athletic nouveau riche catholic in laws to rub in my face
501484 well im sorry but that harold seems to worm his way into everything
501485 my god donald you have a bigger problem with him than i do and you will note at least i have the good grace to admit im jealous of him hes depressingly competent i hear hes even good with his hands
501486 although he can have that fair colleen ever notice shes got an ass that drags on the ground
501487 eat up its an averah to leave food on your plate you could wait till shavuos for this one to make up her mind i demand to speak to the manager eat it theyll say you ate it anyway this hangnail ive never known such pain im doyingk
501488 i know plenty of jews new york jews who arent a bit like her oy oy oy all over the place
501489 dont understand the pressure she invites us to passover seder every year my mother makes us go there for break fast
501490 your mother makes you she still rules you at your age tell her no for chrissakes elaine talk some sense into your husband
501491 no wonder you like dora she saw gentlemans agreement she didnt think it applied to her either
501492 poor harold is stuck in a dead end lecturers position at simmons he hasnt published and his fianc e left him for a portuguese dental student from
501493 wheres the conflict bill this is no story its a pile of ruminations wheres the denouement in
501494 shes a girl of no account donald shed be washing our clothes if she hadnt got herself knocked up by your author
501495 i take that back i would have fired her for incompetence and insolence shed have stolen too
501496 shes got a pretty face ill give her that but shes a drinker so the bloomll be off that rose before too long i pity the next fellow who lands that one
501497 yah youre right christ what was i thinking ok delete this set piece its a pimple on the ass of progress no she wouldnt say that would she ill revise it tomorrow yes to morrow no i did not rifle the
501498 bill this isnt going well there is something fundamentally altered in your writing
501499 it lacks the old well lets call it the wild cynical energy that is you my friend
501500 theres been a lot of turmoil for me here a lot of changes its been hard
501501 well what i mean bill my lad is that it seems prettied up somehow tranquilized with uplift
501502 someones been tinkering with your work bill thats what i think there is another consciousness at work here i dont believe youve changed all that much in a few months my question is who and why
501503 oh yes i believe it has a hyphen that violates the rules russell has a surprising tendency to break rules
501504 you should see the rotten letters i drew all vowels except h and thats rough breathing it looks like hawaiian over here
501505 i didnt realize we were into life or death scrabble we generally dont go in for kills lovey
501506 i guess bills been working hard with his editor whats the slave driver like
501507 i hear hes a very nice looking young man his wifes not here is she
501508 youll love this one p r i c k s add the points for h a h a s too
501509 no but golden ages never last long everything afterwards seems wanting a letdown of divine proportions
501510 if we veer into theology i will go and have a drink right this instant
501511 he was trying to get rid of vowels werent you whats
501512 i did marry somebody brilliant how did you ever think of that
501513 calls the place an inn i suspect she doesnt want to teach grammar school kids all her life
501514 too bad you couldnt put the x on a double point score not that many points
501515 how is your mr blake doing i havent seen him in his usual haunts lately
501516 i doubt that he came home worn out after ten hours with his editor
501517 the broadwoods are relentlessly upbeat today im of a mind to break my rule and offer you both a drink
501518 i knew i shouldnt come over here none of you take anything seriously
501519 oh leave me alone all of you you take my life and problems so lightly you only care about your own pleasures
501520 my turn again ive got a good one this time too c r a p u l o u s cuts a couple of ways doesnt it
501521 oh my god russell you know very well weve discussed it a hundred times some of it anyway
501522 or deception in your moments of highest bliss watch out
501523 and for one to be redeemed another must suffer funny old universe
501524 so what douglas isnt it nice to know that someone in this town is getting laid every night and that its you you dont know how lucky you are old pip
501525 the physical advantage of the adversary doesnt necessarily carry the day
501526 im already whispering for chrissakes you want me to learn sign language
501527 as far as it goes you can i dont know how i feel or i feel too good dont demand a detailed analysis from me now for gods sake
501528 its not even renaissance rome weve got fucking ike in the white house and that shifty creep from
501529 its a new thought for me too quite subversive maybe we should send a telegram to nixon he could get ike to deploy anti faggot bombers
501530 dont kid yourself youre as expendable as a poverty stricken canuck like claire
501531 if you were at home in your hometown right now would you still take these risks
501532 im douglas broadwood mr blakes landlord is that the right word for it bill
501533 its a pleasure mr broadwood i hope youre taking good care of one of my very favorite writers
501534 i hope we are mr wassermann hes a favorite with us too
501535 look im starved weve been at it since ten this morning i didnt even get to church
501536 i worry hes lost the the thrust made him special an appealingly angry unrefined voice his latest work is excessively genteel too writerly i hope its a temporary thing we really dont need another updyke
501537 i would i was the one who typed all his work and posted it to you
501538 this is number three don douglas in case youre keeping track dinky little glasses too by the way
501539 i hope there wont be too many more weve a lot of work tomorrow too big boy
501540 i need a day off im not a fucking factory hand like one of these poor slobs who stitches shoes in a fucking shoe shop all day long breathing in poisonous dyes slicing their fucking fingers when theyre cutting leather for high heels one little slip and youve got a reject and your pay gets fucking docked
501541 and even if every shoe is perfect the fucking foreman will take the credit for himself and rob you of your bonus
501542 im so sorry mr broadwood i was about to say that i hope you dont mind if we talk a little shop at dinner
501543 now bill i know you dont want to hear this but
501544 youre right about that donny im tired and sick of thinking about that fucking book
501545 bill i was starting to say earlier the last three quarters or so of the book is well it is
501546 i dont know what youre telling me what do you mean another editor
501547 bill somewhere around chapter 6 i noticed that the syntax was changing textual analysis was always my forte in college and graduate school lionel trilling
501548 you know im right here its rude to exclude someone from the conversation like this
501549 all right then the sudden change is near the end of the chapter
501550 it happens within the scene between jimmy and nora when theyre celebrating the acceptance of jimmys novel and they get drunk and start to make love then after about five lines boom its as if we are forced to avert our gaze and all the expectations weve been given for a steamy emotionally complex scene are wiped away by a sponge it becomes very pallid and emotionless tame and small somehow i was telling your friend here that i was reminded of updyke
501551 the word play and the underlying humor were gone i cant understand it bill what happened has
501552 i remembered where i can find the original draft for you ill see you tomorrow at 9 sharp ok donny
501553 given everything that we know now mr broadgood i think it would be wise for him to register at my hotel lauberge du capitain until we get the book sorted out i know you arent his keeper and im sure youve done a bang up job of helping him in his work and even saving him from the worst of his self indulgences his drinking anyway
501554 i remember you you were the one who was always going downtown hanging around with that bunch of coterie of extremists who called themselves beat the beats now yclept the beat niks a little shtetl humor from that ginsberg character i have no doubt as i recall you were somehow involved with that bibulous kerouac you had quite the crush on him oh yes it was all over columbia lionel used to laugh about it unrequited love is hard i suppose
501555 i do hope he finds those manuscript pages he needs a real editor to look at them this time
501556 mr blake how good to see you again you look very well
501557 my god whats happened to you where were you anyway
501558 i needed a respite from this town as you might imagine
501559 dont then but come with me russell told me how guilty he felt about your recent visit he was preoccupied with me i suppose he said you seemed extraordinarily happy
501560 no no stay come into my office theres a matter of some importance which must be discussed
501561 billy at last at last i see my boy in the flesh
501562 excuse me i must see how mrs cobb is doing mrs blake a pleasure
501563 im sure your foolish cat and mouse games havent done me any good though i must say your new life seems to agree with you you look very well
501564 no i said you looked healthy now i remark that you look well in a general way body and mind
501565 i hear youve been working here that youve almost completed your novel
501566 he thinks it will sell you may be able to support yourself at last
501567 i do believe donald hes an excellent editor ive seen what hes done with your previous work and ive read other books hes edited hell steer you right even if he cant steer his own life very well
501568 you dont think the troubles hes created for himself will jeopardize the publication of your book do you
501569 no he may be an idiot in his personal life but hes a real professional he wouldnt jeopardize his career
501570 i know youve worked very hard on this book billy the hardest and most devotedly youve ever worked
501571 this is a picturesque little town a little too self conscious but pretty pretty pretty i liked the broadwood inn a little ragged about the edges but the proprietor seems to be making well considered changes built on a large scale lots of possibilities that havent been realized as yet he seems an odd bird though dont you agree
501572 hes big and manly almost cloddishly gargantuan i was afraid he would be a little fairified creature
501573 longer i noticed your tendencies when you were a child i tried to toughen you up make you a man the soft mannerisms the crushes you had on other boys like that edgar williams who came to such a sad end in a seamy situation
501574 he killed himself with pesticide did you know that what cruel self commentary his mother told me she was glad when it was over she was sick of having to explain him to everyone she was worn out in his defense i could see her point
501575 i understood how the poor woman felt i hated buying you gifts did you know that most mothers love to buy their children like a treat for themselves id imagine once you wanted a jean harlowe doll how you loved those nancy drew books
501576 dora come off it you must have me confused with edgar williams
501577 you were never interested in playing with trains trucks or tin soldiers never played sports football even baseball was too rough for you i always felt so ashamed buying gifts for you that i had to order them from boston and had them delivered all wrapped up your father was concerned about it too he blamed me of course this was one of his excuses for running off when we lost our money youve succeeded in deballing our son and next youll do it to me i must say he died fittingly drunk as a skunk falling off a yacht at catalina
501578 youre not blaming me for the failure of your marriage for my fathers drinking and death
501579 you may find this hard to believe but i was overjoyed when you announced to me that youd got that catholic girl pregnant i thought thank god billy heres your ticket to a normal life i couldnt bear her and her nouveau family of course but i hoped that the child would be the making of you the family responsibilities and so on it seemed to work for a while dont you remember how happy i was in those days i even rather liked being a grandmother which is something id never desired or aspired to until i realized the boy wasnt right in the head
501580 pisode with the catholic priest that extraordinarily handsome young man gwynne in her desperation confided in me she mentioned your infatuation and i told her she should be a better wife dont blame me if you cant keep your husbands interest i told her and the vulgar little bitch actually told me to go fuck myself you made him a fairy she shouted youre like something right out of freud i said i didnt know you were capable of reading freud are you sure you understood what you read oh billy those were terrible days i was so relieved when finally she left and we could have the house to ourselves again
501581 i wish the hell you had you think its been easy you think i havent been tormented my whole goddamned life
501582 you are you are fucking monstrous why do you think i drink so much
501583 youre weak like your father why dont you do aa
501584 why do you think im always so fucking pissed why do you think i push everybody away
501585 except men certain big masterful men you dont push them away do you
501586 next youll be telling me youre in love with him
501587 its been good for me here ive written well better than ever ive finished the book i started seven years ago
501588 im staying here dora thats it i am not going back to angleport ever not even to say hello or shit on you ive made a decision not to be in a rage the rest of my life lurching around in misery like some shit faced mick ive thrown away enough of my life for once im going to do what
501589 living openly as a queer thats what you have in mind isnt it half of a happy couple the picture of fairy domesticity
501590 lots of people have figured it out dora the townies dont seem too upset about it
501591 billy youve always done exactly what you wanted so dont rewrite history for me now you must do your duty you are coming back to angleport with me
501592 yes you most certainly are your ex wife and her perfectly splendid husband are splitting up neither one wants the boy you have to help me raise him he my dear is your duty
501593 i told you yes its time to shoulder your responsibilities like a man time to quit playing the bohemian
501594 this is a history of the church by someone named eusebius whats a eunuch
501595 hi bill blake you might remember me im your son gre go ri os you fucked me up
501596 your mothers kind of a bitch sometimes its all your fault billy
501597 what exactly is wrong with him they were saying juvenile schizophrenia two years ago
501598 they dont know shit bill they dont know whats going on in my head buncha quacks quack quack quack quack make way for fucklings
501599 billy ive made a new will you wont be saddled with him forever i stipulate that gwynne will take him back her own inheritance from me will depend on her taking adequate care of him
501600 its an inescapable fact of existence that parents best exercise control from the grave
501601 the jobs too hard for me dora i shouldnt take it you couldnt pay me enough
501602 billy ive lavished everything on you all your life when im gone youll be on your own
501603 and then i bought the land the ymca is on that awful place has to go its an ugly pseudo gothic mess and what a dreadful element lurks around there
501604 you know its a wonderful corner property perfect for a bank lazy people like drive up service these days oh and i bought the property all around the customs house right down to the water theyre going to redo that building and make it some sort of museum of maritime commerce that should pay off nicely although you have to take the long view in a town like angleport nothing ever happens swiftly despite all my exertions but you should live long enough to reap the profits
501605 i bought it all rather cheap some of it during the depression but its appreciating now
501606 then theres the house you were brought up in it will be all yours the antiques the old maps the china trade mementos all of it ive had it appraised much of what we have is of museum quality worth a fortune today ten fortunes in twenty years
501607 my point dear is that youll be quite well fixed
501608 youll have plenty of time to do your main work though youll be able to devote yourself to your writing
501609 if youd told me this a year ago id have been ready to play lord of the manor id have run out and bought a silk smoking jacket and an irish setter someone intelligent for fanny to talk to
501610 maybe i should bequeath it to the historical society theyll outfit it with spinning wheels and spinets for the common herd with docents dressed like bo peep nice vision for our
501611 at least itll be a real museum just make sure you get a percentage of the till
501612 you are impossible you can do nothing with a good grace can you
501613 low tide comin gonna be hard to bear after the high tide of money
501614 the windows were open so much for the fifth commandment
501615 bill forgive me but i cant talk about it not yet i can scarcely pray to god about it in the quiet of the night
501616 i feel pretty good get thee behind me all that
501617 even though ive resisted temptation would jesus christ turn his back on me in disgust
501618 they didnt burn people at the stake in his time the lucky ones got stoned
501619 no jesus wouldnt have recommended that either he wasnt that kind of savior
501620 what about all this duty crap what the hell am i supposed to do about that
501621 jesus asked who are my mother and my brothers its a matter of survival
501622 its a professional risk anyway i will tell you one thing and i hope youll take it to heart its my professional opinion that god gives you certain gifts gifts you dont necessarily want these are gifts which you would be doing him great offence not to accept with gratitude and constancy
501623 forgive me for lacking subtlety at a time like this russell but
501624 the unspoken core of the commandments is another injunction from god it is choose life you must make a decision whether or not you want to survive how best can you live and give glory to god and all his creation you cant do it if youre dead or if youre dead in your heart your soul youre open to true evil in that case the fear that corrupts every moment and every emotion every action and every word so which will it be bill do you want to live and increase gods glory with your here it comes god given talents do you want to increase love where you can or do you want to keep on tearing the world down destroying yourself all the while
501625 it is why im not the bishop of a rich metropolitan diocese i meet people where they are not where some frightened man in authority says they should be it helps to be a sinner yourself of course
501626 this sounds good russell the things i want to hear but is it theology or sophistry
501627 the imperatives of the living take precedence over everything god needs us to be alive truly alive he needs us to love him and each other do not throw the gifts hes given you back in his face both of you will sorrow
501628 the world is sick bill the only medicine that can save its life is love
501629 youre about the only one who knocks at the back door anyway i saw you kind of looming in the shadows
501630 smells like you fell into a vat of wine stomping grapes with lucy im making us some tea
501631 i needed to talk to someone who understands what its like to
501632 save it you dont have to start pretending you care now
501633 he wont be allowed to stay in town for long
501634 since the movie crew came to town people have been getting kind of wild theyre doing whatever they feel like doing
501635 youre not good at the real actual world we all live in are you always hiding in some fantasy world of books and oh what daydreams
501636 father knew about you everything about you douglas you think he didnt know but he did and he spoke about it to mother and me he despised you for your
501637 front door please youre not the yard man are you
501638 well sure i guess id better its been quite a long day
501639 what you seem to be lost in a fascinating interior monologue
501640 hes got enough material here for two novels maybe three they defy categorization this bids fair to become a seriocomic sweep of
501641 these are very heavy matzoh balls youre serving up bill well need a hell of a lot of work to ideate a lighter recipe if not youll sink the book
501642 but i worked so hard on this donny theres a lot of great writing here
501643 no damn it im not cutting this out ill revise it some but its got to stay ive given in to you all over the place but not here
501644 the problem with american fiction is that its its not political enough
501645 for your information mr trend seeker we are living in an age of narcissism ever since hemingway and norma fucking shearer
501646 if people think two hundred pages of fucking whale zoology is so fucking fascinating they can put up with my fucking obsessions for a couple of pages
501647 when i hear the triple fuckings i know im licked so have it your way my scribe youll see my point before too long im sure you always do meanwhile i remind you that despite your tantrums the book has been pruned down to a reasonable length and focus it could actually sell william with the right promotion if we ingratiate ourselves with the right people
501648 fine work in the long section set in the eighteenth century
501649 i think this can hit big bill americas had enough of bloated soap operas
501650 now i know the way of out the dead end the book
501651 if this or any other book is to be published mr greenleaf has demanded demanded one more thing of you bill
501652 not that although i think it would be a good idea but no even mr greenleaf has the romantic notion that writers creativity is fueled by the alcohol they consume
501653 he chided me for staying here too long i have neglected my duties for all that this was a working holiday emphasis on the working
501654 i suppose he wants me to have a chaperone twenty four hours a day
501655 what are you no who are you characters to demand this of me am i your goddamned serf your chattel lincoln freed the slaves almost a hundred years ago
501656 id fucking belt you if i didnt need this book published before im truly and universally written off thanks a fucking heap my buddy my pal
501657 there is no true vision there is no art anywhere in these traitorous days my darling
501658 that even though i was a paying guest at that pretentious auberge i was not invited to remain can you believe that well alla trotter is hardly a talented actress is she more of a mammary phenomenon and of course shes slept her way to the top if top is what that precarious perch is
501659 which she is frightening facelift and all those bill grinned as the townies next to them went shush and
501660 cheaper too and brenda doesnt have to rehash her si triste childhood
501661 i wonder if to some degree all emotion isnt play acting
501662 i mean think of it this way the world is a system of conventions youre scripted as much as i am when im in a movie were all expected to feel certain things and react in certain ways in any given situation delight disapproval longing terror
501663 we all act to some extent as an actress its my job to be aware of it and to give it a slight twist to play it up and perhaps to acknowledge the ever so slight mendacity that we all share in expressing our feelings
501664 i have gone on and on i really should be going
501665 oh the life of a movie actress isnt as glamorous as you think i have to get up at five for a call
501666 mr blake its nice to see you here tonight your old lodgings i believe where is that tall landlord he reminds me of raymond massey in arsenic and old lace please introduce me to your very handsome friend
501667 this is my editor brenda the taskmaster i told you about
501668 oh i wouldnt feel too bad mr wassermann i surely wouldnt expect a man of your attainments to follow the film career of someone who well someone like me ooh
501669 don i know youre an intellectual and you probably go to foreign films or revivals of lefty warners pictures yes
501670 really i feel as if ive met my soul mate
501671 so handsome and soooo smart mr wassermann how delightful to meet you i hope to see you again quite soon
501672 you too mr blake when will we be graced with your presence again
501673 all that busy it isnt every day one gets to enjoy the company of so charming a lady
501674 we have an early call tomorrow as well dont we donald id leave by myself but i fear the mischief that youd do brenda
501675 you happen to be right william but soon miss ballard
501676 no youre not mistaken shes a whore and a sneaky conniving little bitch shed sell her turds to hearst if it would help her career
501677 i dont think you should talk about miss ballard that way what has she ever done to you
501678 arent we supposed to be working on my book our book i mean
501679 oh were doing all right weve made blazing progress we dont have to work like slaves each and every day
501680 well time is of the essence why dont you tackle chapter 8 while i go for a walk you know
501681 ive been here weeks and weeks and have still seen very little of this town
501682 yes youre right weve really made great progress havent we old boy
501683 yah anyway i could use some unchaperoned time to write on my own
501684 i told your girl that i wanted the sarah orne jewett room which your brochure said was the finest in the house and she assured me it was available
501685 think of the people whod love to get away from it all for a long winter weekend
501686 this place is gorgeous in the seen it of course it might mean unblocking the fireplaces and sticking a bit of insulation in the walls but you could get people up here from too if they arent very hot skiers bunny slopes theres a market for you mr broadwood
501687 we could call that one the american chanukkah tradition package we you could even serve their special foods i could research them and teach aunt claire how to make them
501688 you know we have to get her some help i love my aunt but i dont think shes up to the new requirements
501689 and what the fuck has your so called prudence ever gotten you
501690 here i dont blame you for not finding my name this is a goddamn mess
501691 and for the rate i was quoted i should be able to stay at the auberge
501692 south on route 1 youll get there in a couple of hours
501693 then we go out for drinks you know to unwind some i have ginger ale or something like that you dont mind do you baby
501694 were both in love with him you cant fool me im not as dumb as you think i am
501695 hey sure theyre all over town together havent you seen them shes in some kinda dopey disguise like when theres a shitty wardrobe budget anyhow
501696 this is a charming place mr broadwood youre making wonderful changes i think more people should know what a gem youve got here and this quaint little town
501697 ah carol what a great hire for you douglas that young ladys a treasure
501698 and charge the hell to use them to recoup the investment
501699 but only in the better rooms charge extra for that too like a hospital
501700 no thats really not my place mr broadwood youre the boss
501701 no details yet but if youd like to work here full time after graduation i would be willing to give you a percentage a small percentage of the business
501702 theres brenda ballard isnt she lovely more beautiful than on the screen umm whos the lost looking little guy shes leading around
501703 well fine be a prick to me but what about elaine shes desperate to have you back
501704 since when did love ever enter into the equation for you or is it love when you hit the urinals
501705 no shes not a real whore would take her payment and split she wants to suck you dry and throw you away
501706 well well well bill what can i do for you
501707 big big hit of the summer by the one and only elvis the pelvis
501708 never mind driver it isnt the person i thought it was proceed
501709 well is he coming or must i hunt him down myself
501710 you take it wrong i hired a plane in angleport and flew to the strip at whats it
501711 your place seems charming full of downeast touches i can see youre doing a good business
501712 i saw billy last night you know he was walking around in some lousy neighborhood ive never seen him look so well something here must agree with him
501713 he looked as though hed been writing quite diligently he always has a glow about him when the works going well it pleases me very much donald wassermann thinks he has a best seller on his hands even that wretched old greenleaf is a believer now finally
501714 you know i dont see him he moved out of here a while ago
501715 i wish youd sit down youre so tall billy comes from a short family alas i nevertheless think of us as commanding i am anyway
501716 tell me mr broadwood do you own this place outright or do you have a mortgage
501717 mmm good i mean the martini and the point i like your place victorian white elephants arent really the thing but this is less hideous than most i assume it was the family manse before you opened it up to the polloi like a stately home in england
501718 spending down the capital taking desperate measures not to be homeless i am familiar with the situation having been in it once myself i pulled myself up by the bootstraps after billys father scampered all the way to california about the time of the crash you seem to be doing the same good for you i applaud your doggedness
501719 i have wallace nutting in my house too not on the main floor though
501720 oh you know who where is my boy really staying have you hidden him away here in one of those turrets perhaps rapunzel rapunzel
501721 youd better phone him again and tell him to put on some long pants i dont want to see his knobby knees and toes sticking out of his sneakers youd think he didnt own a stitch of good clothing
501722 he began writing again when he was staying with us
501723 then why did he leave simply to placate donald wassermann
501724 you look so comfy donald i wish i could unbend and dress like a middle western tourist
501725 dear dora you couldnt be anything but the great lady you are
501726 its been too long dear boy what a pity its another scrape of billys that brings us together
501727 is he nearly done with the book how is it going when do you think it will be published donald is it
501728 its very good dora i promise you well publish as soon as we can it will require a lot of editing yet
501729 bills gone off into new territory you know what that means more reflection more revision more time
501730 youre saying you havent a clue donald are you actually paying any attention to him what are you about these days
501731 would you like a drink donald ill have that martini now thank you
501732 hes been working very hard all summer dora hes actually quite well youd approve the novel is his best work by far i think it will sell
501733 if that little worm of a cheever can do it
501734 really donald isnt that wonderful is there much money in it for a writer like billy i mean hes not exactly one of those best seller sausage machines is he
501735 would he have any type of artistic control or would he be another literary dp out there i can only grieve when i think of f scott not to mention that sad case of the southerner faulkner i think it was
501736 whos got the jewett room the next couple of nights those people from
501737 they canceled mrs oconnor had it for tonight but her boyfriend wanted her home a day early god knows why
501738 dont worry i remember the guy when brenda ballard was here that night
501739 im glad theyre not staying with us thered be no pleasing them especially the duchess
501740 of course id like to meet her you must think im a fatal prude right out of the house of mirth dear donald if you are happy then i am marriages dont last for ever not now and not ever if truth be told
501741 hello mr broadwood why what an honor this is would you like a nice cup of tea
501742 i like it here damn it ive completed the book well not quite and i need a little more undisturbed writing time a couple more days and im done with beach and then right away i want to start on the next one preliminary notes and exploratory passages anyway eyes wide open good working title isnt it
501743 lets go to a rather posh place i know in tappan we you cant stay here
501744 posh did you actually say posh let me dress up a bit
501745 pack all your things now ill put you up for a few days if you like it wont be safe to come back here later shell have found out where youve been staying and shell camp out here till we get back
501746 herself hits the hay by nine every night she and the barber rockin and rollin all night long

501750 so whats the situation chez broadwood these days are we still in the
501751 maybe we wont have the same the same spark or whatever you call it it might be over has that occurred to you
501752 im not sure it just occurred to me sitting across from you in this spooky joint the kings arse i dont know
501753 what are you doing all night why not find out tonight lets end all uncertainty lets face the reality of it
501754 no well i do know i dont want to be alone like i was before you came along
501755 it means i dont know what else could it mean
501756 it might mean you dont intend to stay at all that youre toying with me with all of us here
501757 why do you have to bring all of selene into it dont you just want to go fuck
501758 youve become part of the town whether you realize it or not despite everything you do to put people off they seem to like you they usually hate outsiders they like you maybe youre crusty enough for them and then i like you and im part of this town
501759 bill they already know theyve probably always known they know about you and me too and no one seems particularly fazed
501760 how much does anyone really know about another persons private life
501761 do you really want this stuff id rather have a ham sandwich and a beer
501762 ill do as i like and love as i like
501763 you know damn well pal hey better not drink too much gut a long day ahead a ya hafta keep your pecker up
501764 ah there he is no no its all right dont run off no hard feelings i was wrong to be so pushy please accept my apology

501768 well ok nice to see you again russell enjoy the iron
501769 dont blow it god may forgive jesus may be merciful but im not do not hurt that dear soul
501770 ssssh must be discreet more than discreet ultra super duper discreet
501771 i want you i want you now douglas you can see that cant you
501772 i want you too bill you knew that almost from the beginning i think
501773 but if we ever do anything it must be far away from here you see that
501774 i suppose my life our lives are on display here in selene
501775 all right now youd better go to your own room im exhausted
501776 hey baby what would st francis of sales think of this getup
501777 he enclosed a check for 200 thats milk shake money whats with him anyway there are more jesus references in three lines than ive used in my entire life these literary jews love to throw him in your face he was one of us and you let
501778 i can assure you that we wont have a room for him were overbooked as it is
501779 actually no youre not think back a bit will you
501780 get with it billy be a man for gods sake if you have the balls for the job
501781 no i meant that im having a corrupting effect on you
501782 to be honest i talked like that long before you showed up on the scene sometimes
501783 sometimes you know i think we fall in love to retrieve something we lost feeling free mostly and the person we fall for well he or she does a good job of reminding us how it feels thats all
501784 evelyn i wish you wouldnt talk like that about yourself
501785 sweetheart im not a complete idiot no one around here is not even my brother
501786 oooh i need some new polish on my toenails you dont think this frosted pink color is too young for me do you
501787 brenda tries to be a person of substance she wants to be taken seriously shes risen from well not humble circumstances lets say that they were distinctly middle class very readers digest condensed books she wants more to have more and
501788 brenda loves artists she loves men of words she loves men who can create a new reality with their vision through the pain and wisdom that theyve acquired simply by existing on this ridiculous planet she doesnt care about looks or a big cock she cares about the mind the soul this is because she has a hunger for knowledge and wisdom
501789 which is why when dave told me hed met a writer at the inn i had to sit down with you he told me you were nice looking too but he didnt do you justice maybe he was jealous and envious
501790 youre handsome and brenda likes small men she hates being physically in someones thrall she likes being able to put up a good fight
501791 there are times when being roughed up has its charms
501792 why say that is what a woman wants so unacceptable to men in our society its fairly common for women to like forceful lovers with thick cocks its the thickness that really matters did you know that
501793 spoken like a man with a big load my honesty doesnt scare you does it
501794 you refer to yourself in the third person that fucking scares me
501795 hell be along soon he said he thought you might swing you know both ways ac dc i can see that dear dumb dave was right this time
501796 ooooh my boy you have some fun ahead of you
501797 anyway you havent told me about your writing dave said it was a novel are there good female characters are they convincing or simply the typical shitty projections of male vanity queero writers are different though arent they they understand women better than real men i mean than real men do im sure they understand real men very well
501798 brenda sometimes wonders if there are any real men she thinks every man is something of a faggot way deep down
501799 i wonder are there any good parts for women if your book is adapted for pictures
501800 bill so how are you two getting along friendly or is brenda playing one of her bitchier parts tonight
501801 bill thinks brendas weird because she refers to herself in the third person you do know what the third person means dont you dave
501802 oh boy babe how much have you had to drink
501803 not much i like to keep a clear head when im getting it from both ends at once im not one to dull my own pleasure
501804 brenda likes to shock people shes really a sweet girl as sweet as she looks
501805 we sure have our work cut out for us huh
501806 i cant do this i cant be with these people
501807 she said she was sorry she had a bad day i didnt know until you left alla trotter tried to get her fired she gets like that when shes scared brenda does i mean
501808 she wants to see you she wants to make it up to you shes really a swell girl
501809 twice youve taken me to the brink and dropped me
501810 you leave this room and i wont speak to you again you can go back to your fantasy man in new york the beatnik or whatever the hell he is you can jerk off the rest of your life compose stupid letters youll never send
501811 claires got a big mouth she also worships you and shes more efficient at cleaning up your waste paper than you are
501812 youll never be ready unless i make you ready you chicken hearted piece of shit
501813 i love you dont be like this this isnt what love should be like please bill
501814 wir sollten respekt vor der entwicklung chinas haben und vor der gr e der probleme die die chinesische f hrung meistern muss in einem land mit eineinhalb milliarden menschen von denen mehrere hundert millionen noch immer unvorstellbar arm sind
501815 trotzdem d rfen wir selbstbewusst sagen dass wir manches was in china geschieht nicht f r richtig halten wenn man das respektvoll tut so ist meine erfahrung st t man auch auf offene ohren
501816 ich verstehe nicht warum die chinesische regierung mit der begrenzung des internet zugangs erneut weltweite skepsis geweckt hat
501817 treasure every single moment you have with someone you care about
501818 mikko me mantuvo bajo presi n todo el d a
501819 corrimos al l mite todo el d a simplemente no se puede ir m s r pido
501820 bitte einen sch nen gro en kaffee mit ohne milch
501821 deben apropiarse del discurso para desarrollar uno propio e inigualable que aporte a la cobertura te rica
501822 the competition starts on the ground i want to make them all nervous so they make mistakes in the air
501823 there are no mind games going on if you want to win you got to whip out your wallet were all envious of hannes we all wish we had that canopy obviously it works it makes an airplane faster it just ups the bar for everyone now we all gotta go out and buy a new canopy this is just escalating into a giant money war
501824 you have to understand this is a race about the fastest airplane
501825 you as a pilot can make a difference of maybe one tenth of a second hannes is beating us by three seconds i dont care what you say youre not going to close that gap by being a better pilot you gotta go back and make investments in your plane hes obviously done it and done a good job and it shows im jealous im sure everyone else is too
501826 we all know mike performs better when hes wound up so we need to calm him down
501827 im trying to ignore all of that they can worry themselves about their own little problems but im just going to pretend there are 11 other guys out there competing to win you could try to put psychological pressure on people but i think these guys are all clever enough i just concentrate on my flying and let everything else take care of itself
501828 if you look at ism and the unemployment number together it suggests an economy that is at best stuck in neutral
501829 but we are forecasting continued growth in the economy for the back half of the year and it will be that growth that will determine a return to job creation
501830 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system a growing credit crunch we need to do more
501831 we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002
501832 overall the report looks to be broadly consistent with other data that show the economy quite soft basically stalled not growing very much but not contracting very much either
501833 surprise surprise never something i could hide when i see we made it through another day
501834 ill sing it one last time for you then we really have to go youve been the only thing thats right and i can barely look at you but every single time i do i know well make it anywhere away from here light up light up as if you have a choice even if you cannot hear my voice
501835 i have never made but one prayer to god a very short one o lord make my enemies ridiculous and god granted it
501836 for four days senator john mccain and his allies have accused senator barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
501837 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky

501845 the data really confirm that the most severe impact of the epidemic continues to be among gay and bisexual men of all races and among black men and women

501886 how can killing ones son be the greatest act of love
501887 two years ago was a horrible election for republicans in a horrible environment the environment is now worse for republicans than it was two years ago and that means the election results could be as bad or even worse

501890 now some of you wont agree with me saying that whats the difference between any of those zombie movies agreed that this is one of those zombie movies but with a pinch of difference what i found nice is the use of editing done in the movie also the scenes which would make you feel the fear and pressure as to whats gonna happen next kinda feeling u know
501891 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic

501897 there were no locks on the doors and you could pretty much wander the building without a lot of interference
501898 toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety
501899 there was a requirement to register the laboratory not the individual
501900 thats when locks went on doors and armed guards and the whole nine yards
501901 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions and plans
501902 i dont believe that reviewing a persons medical record is part of a typical security investigation unless there is an indication that theres a concern there
501903 and the alternative here is to have a much higher level of scrutiny for everybody in the system i dont particularly want investigators going through my medical records if theres not a reason a security related reason to do that
501904 and we want to kind of seize this opportunity take control and say were going to prepare people for an earthquake
501905 it is inevitable all the statistics will show that we will have a major earthquake in this region and so we need to be prepared
501906 nobody can be prepared for what we believe is coming in the next two decades or so
501907 there could be a loss of 10 000 lives downtown and the biggest loss of life comes from flying glass
501908 thats what these wake up calls are about to look at how we can do it better

501914 you look like someone took your bottle before last call
501915 and you look like someone who got into a bar fight over the booze on the floor
501916 whats wrong did they confiscate that box of cigars you brought home kid
501917 out of my cold dead hands whats wrong with you sir did you get your ass blistered for going up against the president and losing
501918 you know shes out of her frakking mind ellen went down and she couldnt even remember her own name let alone ellens
501919 sit down sir lets talk against our leaders like good high level officers
501920 theres a difference between disloyalty and blowing smoke and you damn well know it
501921 gods youre demanding i just lit up you big baby
501922 everyone knows youre practically running the bootleg booze industry in the fleet you can always get more of that rotgut sir
501923 old mans pissed at me too never mind that we needed that stupid arrow after all never mind you were just doing your job
501924 hes got me grounded for a week and lees back on duty as cag sounds like the loves wearing thin sir
501925 im not going to get into that with you starbuck
501926 thats the old mans business and the old man runs this ship in case you were thinking of forgetting again
501927 never did forget as a matter of fact adama is my commander now and forever so say we all
501928 shit was easier when i just wanted to drink frak and blow shit up
501929 nowadays theres too much about loyalties to the uniform to the colonies
501930 at least youre bright enough to know you dont like it either
501931 so how did the old man punish you for aiding and abetting that womans victory over him
501932 id rather be shoved through an airlock than hear the old man tell me in so many words how disappointed he was in me
501933 anyhow ive talked too much and you probably have a busy schedule of screwing around and doing nothing to get back to
501934 and youve got your busy off duty life to attend to i suppose sir
501935 youre not here because you mean us any harm or because youre a programmed enemy of humanity youre here because you had an affair with one of our raptor pilots
501936 because i chose to come here and i know you dont believe me
501937 even if you find the tomb even if you find the map even if you find earth the price you pay will be too high
501938 i know that there is a cylon force on kobol i know its dangerous and i have little doubt that you are communicating everything i say even as we speak
501939 its simple what i need to know and what might keep you alive is exactly how to find the tomb of athena
501940 and i will do my best to lead you to the tomb
501941 i want to know where it is and you either know or you dont
501942 i can show you the path i dont know how long the path is or where the path leads to but i can tell you youre going to have to move very very quickly
501943 you seem to know so much prophecy sharon your god seems to do a poor job of giving cues when youre in part of the story
501944 at least my god doesnt punish me for what i am
501945 or do you think the madness is a fringe benefit
501946 if you are lying to me sharon i will put you out of the airlock
501947 and for good measure i will make sure that lieutenant agathon is with you i dont need any cylon infiltration of my fleet
501948 you can use it tonight you and dee deserve a little privacy for all the grief youve been put through
501949 i can be a little less comfortable for the night for a good cause
501950 dee is here and you should have seen him trying to find somewhere for them to go
501951 yeah these would be assy accommodations for a romantic evening
501952 lees got patrol tonight so he asked me to come by sorry im late
501953 you have worked some magic on that boy im telling you does he really come by every other day
501954 and he liked being your right hand man a lot more than he admits everyones giving him a lot of crap for being such a mamas boy and hes giving it right back you got to him roslin he doesnt want to admit it but hes a believer
501955 maybe i put something in the water so what did captain adama want to discuss with me
501956 he says that hes very sorry he couldnt meet up with you tonight and that hes been reading the briefings you sent him also you should wear that skirt more often because it makes your legs look great
501957 i dont think its like with the big time prophet laura people you know i think he just likes knowing that you appreciate him he thinks youre the one or whatever wholl get us to earth
501958 plus it would bug me if lee started kneeling in front of me or in front of you well most kinds of kneeling
501959 youre the one whos got hot sex going on in her quarters right now
501960 if youre looking for that kind of a mental image
501961 oh it just makes me happy to know that someones enjoying that bed if thats what you want to call it more than me
501962 its not like ive never had a sleepless night and the company is better than usual
501963 what all these politicians and government types dont do it for you
501964 i appreciate captain adamas visits in part because we can talk
501965 maybe you should transfer over to galactica half the pilots want to make a pass at you of course half of them are doing it just to frak with lee because lees a big baby but the other half hey you might get lucky
501966 what if i dont need to get lucky no offense to the excellent pilots of galactica of course
501967 but that takes time and effort and patience i dont have the time or inclination to be patient lieutenant id settle for a decent conversationalist who realizes im still human
501968 like that sounds mature and defeated of you but youre standing here enjoying the idea youve got a fanclub of hot young things a lot
501969 but lieutenant thrace whoever would want a fanclub of hot young things with a lump in her breast and only a few months to live
501970 think of the scandal think of the shame think of what the press would say
501971 i will kiss you right now to shut you up
501972 think of what the press would say frak thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard come out of your mouth and you sent me on a quest for that stupid arrow
501973 come on sir we all know you like yours young and pretty
501974 lieutenant you know im not going to answer that question
501975 well that was lovely but im afraid i still dont have an answer for you
501976 after all its late and we seem to have a mutual penchant for truth or dare
501977 i have to get you in on a poker game sometime
501978 you dont frak around do you if youre going to do something you just go huh
501979 permita que eu lhe mostre o resultado de s culos de treinamento e sabedoria
501980 is it so much to ask that we stay aware of the situation and not turn this into us versus them
501981 your father is not a bad man damn stubborn though he doesnt listen then again neither does my staff
501982 sometimes i have a hard time understanding why i signed up for this presidency if no one will actually stand with me when i lead or even trust what i say
501983 i dont always agree with you but i trust you are trying to work in the best interests of the colonial fleet thats why i came with you thats why i stayed with you
501984 how far does that trust go if i asked you to lead the limited defensive capabilities of these ships
501985 what if i told you that zarek had betrayed us
501986 that i was afraid he was about to do something precipitous
501987 id do what you needed me to do madam president
501988 what if what i asked you to do had absolutely nothing to do with my role as president
501989 i take two sugars and a splash of milk would you do that for me
501990 i dont believe theres any tea on the astral queen
501991 i would like a cup of black tea with two lumps of sugar served with the tongs my mother gave me in my grandmothers china
501992 i said i would do what you needed me to do
501993 i twisted my ankle walking out of that meeting and i cant get the right spot would you do that for me
501994 i didnt think so many of them would come with us
501995 weve come such a long way together it seems wrong not to
501996 everything goes back to the way it was madame president
501997 we have our path to earth the fleet is united thats what we wanted isnt it
501998 you know thats not for a second what i mean
501999 did i just see my president give me a lustful look
502000 i look at you lustfully all the time but you never seem to notice
502001 you give very piercing looks madame president ive had to stay where i was more than once because of how you look
502002 if we hadnt wasted all those looks i wouldnt want you as much as i do right now
502003 its the kind of thing that makes resistance absolutely futile
502004 i dont think you know the meaning of the word
502005 your worshipers will have to be trained in the art of pleasing you
502006 ill give him billy and two other staffers to be named later
502007 dont stop lee dont stop now you feel so good
502008 if youd said my name again id be dead with you
502009 if you say the word glowing i will do something bad to you
502010 you are glowing ow arent prophets supposed to eschew violence
502011 but it seems to be a twenty four hours a day seven days a week sometimes
502012 but i dont want you to leave in fact if they put a cot in this corridor i could just stay here forever
502013 youre right bill im not sorry i dont need your forgiveness i found the path to earth i stood up to martial law and tyranny i did what i had to do and no i am not sorry
502014 its why you were angry so why not stop dancing around it
502015 you want me to say something madam president madam prophetess shall i say it
502016 its what you forgive me for isnt it the thing i should be sorry about
502017 were the only people in the cafe i thought it would be rude not to say hello
502018 which is why im glad im drinking tea what were you reading
502019 no wonder youre chatting up an older woman the mores of the bourgeoisie must be overcome including their foolish resistance to love as more than a function of class and ideology
502020 also im supposed to go to a keg party at the university and i dont want to
502021 if im talking to a woman my friend wont drag me away
502022 come young man lets escape before the forces of educational conformity lock you back in the arms of blonde girls at keg parties
502023 youre staring at that old babe a little too hard my friend
502024 shes kind of hot but stacey macmillan is going to suck your cock off
502025 wait until youre old before you start banging old babes
502026 did you used to frequent coffeehouses in caprica city about ten years ago
502027 i wasnt in caprica that year for two weeks in the winter i was there i had a small university gig as a politician in residence in caprica city
502028 why did i meet you and forget all about it
502029 i was trying to pick up girls who read zarek at the time and i remember a time where i met this woman who could have been you
502030 did you happen to see her a lot this mystery woman you didnt speak to but remember anyway
502031 she was beautiful and we were all alone in the cafe while i was waiting to get dragged off to a stupid party i humiliated myself my friend rich announced i was going to get well he said something rude and i had my zarek book and i just ran
502032 the beautiful woman in the cafe thats very romantic im flattered
502033 maybe i fell in love with her a little bit the way you do with strangers i thought we could run off and start a coffeehouse together
502034 its not a coffeehouse but we are revolutionaries with tom zarek thats got to count for something
502035 its freezing i would give anything for one of those triple espressos they made at quills it was right across the street from the apartment i was using so id go there a lot when i couldnt stand to be alone
502036 i used to people watch there quite a bit in the evenings and imagine what they were up to who knows maybe its our destiny to spend time together in cold places
502037 so maybe you were miriam thats what i thought her name was miriam
502038 oh thats sweet i had one i used to watch in particular and i decided he was named paul
502039 he was a transfer student and hed never been to the big city before and you were lonely and i was going to sit down and tell you to tell me all about it
502040 she said the reason i was chatting up an older woman was that i was trying to be a revolutionary about love
502041 paul didnt believe me when i said i wasnt married
502042 and then he said that he wanted to buy me a cup of coffee and i told him to forget the coffee that my apartment was right across the street
502043 miriam she uh said she needed to liberate me from blonde girls at keg parties
502044 and that she knew by my dog tags i wasnt the rebel i said i was but it was okay anyway
502045 and i tell him that he can stay the night if he needs to ill make him dinner he looks like he could use a good meal
502046 and miriams smiling at me and i want to frak her right then and there she tastes like tea and cigarettes and the city
502047 i dropped my keys and paul comes up behind me and puts his hand under my sweater
502048 he licks the back of my neck and just keeps touching me even with my hand on the doorknob to my apartment he wont stop he says well you know what he says
502049 captain apollo and i were discussing how small the world is did you know we both liked a little coffeehouse in caprica city quills was the place excellent espresso but the croissants were always stale
502050 can we get out of the cold storage bin zarek the president looks like shes about to freeze and i cant feel my toes
502051 yes mr zarek im aware you still dont like the idea of using religion instead of captain apollos words against his father however in the off chance that commander adama rejoins us i would prefer that we not sabotage our military commander entirely
502052 it would frak with his head and i love messing with lee
502053 youre the cradle robbing president who is abusing her power to seduce a young subordinate
502054 as i recall the pushing was done by a certain blonde pilot who took remarkable liberties with her president
502055 as will the entire fleet god almighty and any cylons who like to watch
502056 or what you invite me over we have mind bendingly amazing sex and now i need to go home until the next time youre horny so nobody knows the president likes hers young hot and female
502057 but i didnt figure on well what are we doing right now lieutenant thrace
502058 but lets not forget that being found together making out in a chair for fun could be taken in a number of ways you might not like
502059 captain apollo do you have something to say or do you intend to keep looking at me the way your father does when hes about to chew me out for making a mistake
502060 kara please dont try to huddle in the corner it isnt captain adamas job to judge what were doing
502061 so were you two ever going to mention the raging insane love thing
502062 or are you two going to tell me youre not
502063 whats complicated you two want to have sex until you cant see straight and so i kind of feel used what with lees welcome home kiss and your whole seduction thing and seriously what the frak are you pissed about lee
502064 maybe thats whats complicated maybe the whole thing is that yeah the last thing i expected to see were the two women i love wrapped around each other
502065 you ever gonna tell me that you close your eyes and think of apollo
502066 are you two going to have this conversation while im standing here
502067 before our conversation deteriorates into next weeks salacious gossip on the newsletter circuit why dont we try to act like reasonable adults and stop fixing blame
502068 i think its something you and i should discuss because i didnt mean for things to get serious nor did i think you did
502069 i got my talking to and now mommy can tell you why its bad of you to feel all jealous because mommy didnt pine after you all the way to the grave because youre a big chicken about speaking up until its already too late
502070 now what i love you you know i love you you
502071 its not like those rumors didnt come up the second you two ran off to start your stupid ass revolution
502072 thats really defeatist and mature of you but i dont believe for a second that youre going to walk away and give up what you want for big doomed love
502073 im not dumb i get that im kind of superfluous here
502074 what do you want kara tell me what you want and i will give it to you
502075 nobodys said that to me before so i dont know what to do
502076 its a very bad idea that could potentially get everyone into a great deal of hot water
502077 didnt think starbuck would be afraid of a little trouble
502078 with trouble at least you know you shouldnt be doing it
502079 one day youre trying to save humanity the next youre on kobol chasing down mythological roadmaps
502080 and then the day after that youre having a charged sexual encounter with the president and your best friend
502081 can i make a wig out of it if you really mean it
502082 you have such beautiful hair someone will need it eventually or they could dress it up
502083 how can i care about being beautiful when everyone i love is dead
502084 i mean i just want you to shave my head is that so hard you said you do hair do mine in
502085 i got a date tonight and i gotta look hot
502086 frak yeah just dont have me shave your head as a precursor to suicide okay
502087 i know folks like you have to exist but if i catch you in my goods again youll be replaced
502088 and ill go to tigh and not adama little girl
502089 we are going with the fleet to kobol as the gods have said
502090 is that lady going to take us home once we find earth
502091 she seems like she would if she knew about all the people there if i told her about ishana shed listen
502092 dont you say a word about that when the prophet comes aboard tala or so help me
502093 i wished for you and our mama and our sisters
502094 i saw you in all my dreams too did you really kill a hundred cylons with a sword
502095 tala is very brave i would have died without her to help me
502096 i am going home soon and everything will be all right
502097 you know i gotta tell you im not sure if i know who you are
502098 you look exactly the way you did in high school
502099 grant didnt you move into rangeview in the middle of your junior year
502100 yeah but sitting the bench on the basketball team i actually made a lot of friends
502101 did you play on the state championship team your senior year

502105 fugitive clark rockefeller was taken into police custody in baltimore today his kidnapped daughter is safe and sound and in police hands law enforcement sources said details of his capture were not immediately clear
502106 there may be decent participation where there are some local races
502107 otherwise turnout could be pitiful if the senate race is the only thing on the ballot
502108 we are doing everything humanly possible to talk directly to voters and get them out to the polls including running commercials in parts of the state radio amp tv phone banking and e mailing visiting churches and knocking on doors
502109 were trying to touch people that we know will come out and vote

502115 what the data actually show is that the 2006 estimate of roughly 56 000 new infections is substantially higher its about 40 percent higher than what had previously been estimated
502116 this stability in the presence of a growing population of hiv infected individuals is encouraging
502117 the data really confirm that the most severe impact of the epidemic continues to be among gay and bisexual men of all races and among black men and women
502118 when you have nearly flat funding for hiv treatment and care and reduced funding for hiv prevention it means were not doing what we need to do

502138 hes so handsome and its so romantic him breaking you out of prison like that
502139 i bet hes amazing in bed you are so lucky
502140 no more running we turn we stand up to my father
502141 all you seem to do is gather worshipers and wait with that beatific smile of yours what is this a fight for democracy or the cult of laura roslin
502142 we fight with what all i have apollo are my supporters
502143 if youre not willing to use the weapons we have we have already lost the gods are a valuable valuable part of whats available to us
502144 if you dont trust me why did you come billy at least had the decency to stay behind when he couldnt come any further
502145 he is angrier at me than he needs to be because i am the bitch who stole his only son after sending kara thrace to die
502146 i am not his puppet and im not yours either
502147 most people who assume that were lovers are surprisingly happy with the idea at least the ones whove asked me
502148 more than one man on this fleet has detailed fantasies about what you do in bed and what youd be like doing it to him
502149 then there are the ones who ask if i feel bad about taking the old mans leavings the ones who ask if theyre pretty enough for you
502150 i dont understand how you can be so casual about this according to rumor you dont have time to be president because youre too busy having sex with the entire crew of galactica that cant be good
502151 also they dont really believe that theyre afraid of my reputation and dont quite trust a woman president and they need a way to counter that fear
502152 i never thought any woman could get me madder than she does but youre up there
502153 after all captain apollo and i have so little time to have sex so we have to fight at the same time
502154 thank you for that wonderful insight into your life mr zarek
502155 however we should not get in the habit of refusing to act and think for ourselves i am defending the democratic way of life of the twelve colonies and i am gratefully accepting what help the gods give me however my first resources are the facts and the world around me we know we have found kobol and that kobol is the most likely source of factual information about earth kara thraces mission to caprica while it may seem illogical is in fact quite rational we have information from the scrolls that the tomb of athena opens using the arrow of apollo and certainly the ancients would have provided a way to find these things as failsafes in time of crisis
502156 but even in extraordinary times our reliance on fact and logic should not be laid aside we must seek earth using all the tools at our hands there has been far too much hysteria and division lately until we can agree that our interpretations may be different but our aims are in concert the promise of earth will elude us
502157 and im sorry for doubting you its just driving me crazy youre doing important work and people think were just fools in love
502158 why do you always say its just me we are doing important work together i couldnt do this without you
502159 i think that youre the most important part of the equation
502160 and i am going to die in a few months
502161 who leads the people then zarek baltar your father i can do a lot in a little time but i still only have so much i need to know there is someone i can trust
502162 are you asking me to stand for election with you
502163 but we have to be practical dont we and things will start looking different when kara comes home
502164 i defied my father and my whole life for you dont pretend that theres nothing between us
502165 theres nothing between us you are my successor and i am your mentor that is whats between us captain apollo
502166 i am this close to breaking captain i am dying and alone and scared to death because i dont know if the gods are talking to me or if i am leading humanity to extinction based on a drug induced fantasy

502176 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
502177 that would deny federal funding to any hospital clinic health plan or other entity that does not accommodate employees who want to opt out of participating in care that runs counter to their personal convictions including providing birth control pills iuds and the plan b emergency contraceptive
502178 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
502179 one of the areas where we are in danger of losing our competitive edge is our space program

502188 could your holiness please explain why the result of karma is sometimes instant and why on other occasions we have to wait lifetimes before the causal effect occurs
502189 one factor would be the intensity of the karmic action itself another factor is the extent to which the various other conditions that are necessary for that karma to ripen are complete and this is dependent in turn on other karmic actions vasubandhu addressed this in the abhidharmakosha in which he states that generally speaking the karmic actions which are the most forceful tend to produce their effects first if the intensity of a karmic action is euqal to that of another karmic action then the result of the action with which the individual is most familiar tends to ripen first however if two karmic actions are equally forceful and equally familiar then the one that is committed earlier tends to produce its results first

502314 leads to one person as well as one global terrorist organization
502315 we have very good evidence of links between osama bin laden al qaeda operatives and what happened on september 11
502316 proof had to be delivered that the september 11 terror attack came from abroad
502317 i have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his osama bin ladens link to the events of the 11th of september
502318 there is no evidence presented in the dossier that directly links bin laden to september 11
502319 there was no doubt of bin ladens responsibility for the september 11 attacks before the tape was discovered
502320 the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it
502321 the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned on osama bin ladens most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
502322 bin laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9 11
502323 the fbi gathers evidence once evidence is gathered it is turned over to the department of justice the department of justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury in the case of the 1998 united states embassies being bombed bin laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury he has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9 11 because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
502324 we havent heard much from him i e bin laden and i wouldnt necessarily say hes at the center of any command structure and again i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him

502333 i was not involved in the september 11 attacks in the united states nor did i have knowledge of the attacks there exists a government within a government within the united states the united states should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity that secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks the american system is totally in the control of the jews whose first priority is israel not the united states i have already said that we are not hostile to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom

502389 love like an invisible bullet took me down and im bleeding
502390 i knew what to expect after hearing her sing in that shower scene in elf
502391 i actually was given some offers to record after elf but i didnt want to do just any old record
502392 a lot of people wanted me to make an album of standards but i didnt want to do that or do anything that could be construed as a vanity project i waited till i found somebody i really wanted to work with
502393 if the songs were not good if the singer was not good if the production was bad any of that would be a great sign this was just a vanity project
502394 i never worried because i knew i was very sincere about this and my intentions were pure i totally put myself out there with this record as long as that was the case i knew it could cut through whatever peoples assumptions might be
502395 its another creative outlet but its something more than that
502396 i just felt like i was going to burst like i had so many songs in me i needed to get them out
502397 they were really elementary lo fi recordings but they sounded great to me that way with just vocals and piano in this really raw form
502398 i knew once i heard the songs and the vocals that it would be a great record her vocals are very classic sounding a vintage quality that you dont hear often listening to the demos reminded of some of my favorite ronettes songs and brian wilson productions i heard things like that in her demos her songs lend themselves to the listeners imagination
502399 theres nothing else ive ever done that was so pure an expression of myself
502400 being an actor can be frustrating because you dont have control over what you put out there i mean i love the work its fun but its always doing someone elses work its the writers words and the directors vision
502401 with this i got to see it from the very start writing the songs in my room to recording and mixing it was amazing
502402 it definitely can burn you out doing movie after movie so im extra excited about this tour
502403 probably wont be out until 2010 or 2011 everyone is so busy
502404 we worked well together so im sure well do it again she told me the favorite films that she has done were where the director trusted the actors to work from improvisation to be able to trust the people you work with inside and outside the studio thats the best framework for creating something interesting
502405 george m cohan was like the james dean of his era a rebel who broke all the rules he and his amazing influence deserve to be better known
502406 which often consisted of singers dancers jugglers animal acts and lowbrow comedians spraying seltzer in each others faces
502407 there was vaudeville on the one hand which was mostly lowbrow and opera on the other
502408 he gave us that even as he created the myth of broadway as this disneyland of theatrical dreams
502409 i probably could have made a series of the same movie but thats not my style
502410 my next is a horror movie my hope is that itll be really good but its not a slam dunk and i have a tendency to go for movies like that like field of dreams
502411 in retrospect a lot of people enjoyed field of dreams but that movie stood a good chance of not working a big chance the question is can you ride the edge with the horror movie i think we have a chance of making a classic in that genre maybe we havent maybe we have but thats more intriguing to me than just making something where we know how it works
502412 i wouldnt think that would be that different than anybody else theyre so hard to make anyway why would you make a movie if you didnt think it had a chance to live beyond its opening weekend im not immune to wanting my movies to make money because i do my first instinct is do i think people could like this
502413 bring a physical comedy to it that i dont often get to show
502414 when i graduated college and everyone knew what they wanted to be doing getting their first job their first house a company car i became a stage manager for 3 50 an hour and i was happy to have that job i worked those blue collar jobs framed houses stood walls i didnt know this was going to happen i just wanted to find my direction in life i hit the jackpot but i didnt make a check in this particular function for seven years

502428 when a federal agency refers to the industry it oversees as its customers a boundary has been dangerously crossed as representative james oberstar the chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee rightly said last week the faas only customer is the air travelling public

502435 the cas has registered an appeal from fc barcelona against the decision made by the single judge of the fifa players status committee regarding the release of players for the olympic games
502436 this appeal will be handled together with the appeals filed by fc schalke 04 and werder bremen against the same fifa decision
502437 the cas will deliver its final ruling on or before 6 august 2008
502438 the judge determined that the international match calendar is not of relevance in establishing whether clubs are obliged to release players for the mens olympic football tournament
502439 taking part in the olympic games is a unique opportunity for all athletes of any sporting discipline
502440 it would not be justifiable to prevent any player younger than 23 from participating in such an event if his representative team had qualified
502441 from the beginning ive said that i want to play for my national team and ive never had problems until now
502442 if i get there and the cas says i have to come back then i will come back
502443 for the moment i want to be with my national team and my team mates
502444 we understand that it will be very difficult to retain the player and for him to take part in our tour of the united states
502445 the normal thing will be for him to now go to join argentina but if the cas makes a decision in our favour then he will have to come back
502446 back home theyre just run of the mill cubicle people
502447 but here theyre like three parts kimora simmons and two parts oasis circa 1995
502448 sometimes you feel like its going to become a situation where they stop and take a picture look at that endangered species a native new yorker with a briefcase going to work

502450 come over and play in new york like its candyland
502451 people with more modest incomes who wouldnt just walk up and say hey let me get a table if theyre back home in london where its too expensive to go to boujis
502452 but in new york they can get away with it
502453 needless to say with the bad economy we could use that extra boost of traffic
502454 the doctors thought i had a heart problem it is not the case i do not have the illness
502455 however it is difficult for me to continue i would have liked to sign with psg but i prefer not to take risks

502457 i was not expecting to end my career like this i would have liked to have been the paolo maldini of paris saint germain but sadly it will not be possible
502458 the economic factors that strained the demand for new vehicle sales in the us for the first half of 08 are still with us full force
502459 the second quarter this year has been one of the fastest changing markets i have ever seen
502460 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
502461 we are writing a new chapter in the auto industry story as customers dealers and companies adjust to a changing environment

502474 russia and cuba are set to make consistent efforts to restore longtime ties in all spheres of cooperation and to expand and strengthen them
502475 the cuban leadership is ready to cooperate with russia in civilian sectors but it is unlikely to revive bilateral military cooperation especially after what happened with lourdes

502510 the polishing steps for a gold crown entail about seven jaw clenching steps from start to finish
502511 i had no one to reach out to my classmates had their own crowns to worry about my teacher had that glossed over look in his eyes that said
502512 pick me up and rub me on your gold crown with your low speed hand piece and a polishing wheel
502513 caught up in the moment i replied okay as my classmates glanced at me clearly annoyed that i was talking to myself again
502514 i picked up the rouge and started to rub it into my polishing wheel softly but with great purpose like i had done it before it felt right the quiet slow whirrrrrr of my hand piece drowned out the moans and wailings of the classroom i was alone i began to gain confidence in the skills i had learned over the past 6 months the feeling of complete and utter belonging overwhelmed me and a tear fled from my eye and floated onto my polishing brush as if to calm the raging sea of red that had enveloped the polishing wheel i lifted the hand piece to my gold crown which was seated firmly to my stone die the red bristles began to dance off the gold like sparks in the wind everything was moving in slow motion now some of my classmates looked up to watch the magnificence that was unfolding before their eyes like spring blossoms i wouldnt be exaggerating if i were to say i saw tears of wonderment well up in their eyes the dull gold which had once been a nagging wound in my back slowly subsided as the gold began to sparkle like the salmon of capistrano as i looked at my reflection in the gold crown i no longer saw a beaten man i saw the chiseled face of a student who had been whittled and pruned by instructors it was this moment that i realized my true calling was to be a dentist

502516 have fun and help osu get ready for stanford day 2
502517 deadwood day 1 at osu no roster surprises but there is concern about jeremy perry the moevao diet plan put down that cheeseburger and step slowly away from the table
502518 i threw a pass to sammie and kind of strained something said canfield
502519 i think it just depends on how i feel if im feeling like i cant make a certain number of throws because i havent done that in awhile then so be it
502520 obviously you never expect an injury my focus is just getting better and just going out there and playing and having some fun like i said its been awhile since ive been out there taking reps since ive been healthy it will feel good just to
502521 just getting the team ready for stanford is the bottom line he said of his immediate goals
502522 as far as the competition you know its good for us it brings out the best in both of us
502523 i dont know about that id say im in pretty good shape said canfield i think riley meant more in terms of handling the long layoff
502524 im not concerned about my physical shape but maybe my shoulder will get sore and i will have to take a day off
502525 im the better quarterback its just a matter of time until i take over again i dont know maybe riley and langsdorf would like to see a little bit of that
502526 i know i definitely have to go out and prove myself
502527 yeah its different i was the guy last august although lyle and i were splitting reps in camp
502528 its something im trying not to think about too much i just want to go out there and play if im running with the twos second team most of the time then my job is to get them ready to go bottom line like i said is getting ready for stanford
502529 maybe he said this or maybe he meant such and such
502530 have you ever walked on a path that has thorns on it umar said
502531 and if allah touches you with hurt there is none who can remove it but he and if he intends any good for you there is none who can keep back his favour he brings it to whom he pleases of his servants and he is the oft forgiving most merciful
502532 men whose hearts are changed by money are not learned
502533 and we shall try you until we test those among you who strive their utmost and persevere in patience
502534 o malik remember they are either your brothers in faith or your equals in humanity
502535 we need spirited energetic and strong young people whose hearts are filled with life enthusiasm zeal and dynamism whose souls are full of ambition aspiration and vigor and have great goals rising and aspiring to reach them until they eventually arrive at their destination
502536 how amazing is the case of a believer there is good for him in everything and this charactristic is exclusively for him alone if he experiences something good he is thankful and that is good for him and if he comes across some diversity he is patient and that is good for him
502537 there are two kinds of action in this world the successful and the unsuccessful now unconsidered hasty action driven by passion rather than wisdom tends to be unsuccessful and the more emotionally involved one is in a particular action the more likely one is to fail to put this in its simplest terms action must be rooted in contemplation contemplation in its turn demands detachment that detachment which every muslim should have at his disposal if he is fully aware of lifes brevity aware of divine judgment aware of the overwhelming presence of allah swt here it seems to me virtue and practical necessity come together the more we act as we should the more likely we are to succeed
502538 you love the world very dearly if you did not love the world you would not mention it so much it is always the purchaser who first disparages what he wants to buy if you were done with the world you would not mention it either for good or evil as it is you keep mentioning it because as the proverb says whoever loves a thing mentions it frequently
502539 i have never heard the adhaan except that i remember the caller who will announce the day of resurrection and i never see the falling snow except that i imagine the flying pages of the records of peoples deeds on that day and i never see swarms of locusts except that i think about the great gathering on the last day
502540 many times i heard imam ahmad saying when asked to give his opinion on controversial scholarly issues i do not know
502541 in such and such a mosque there is a circle that discusses fiqh lit
502542 it used to be said when winter came o people of the qur an the night has become long so you can pray more and the day has become short for you to fast
502543 if you knew god you would know the way to him i worship him although i do not know him you disobey him though you know him with knowledge comes fear yet you are self assured with heresy ignorance yet i feel fear within me
502544 is it not strange that allah gave you good health for years and then when he afflicts you with some pain you wear a banner on your head to advertise your pain
502545 tread not those paths o confused one distress and poverty will overcome you you will be despised let down by friends you will regret it
502546 none of you truly believes until i am more beloved to him than his father his child and all the people
502547 the holy prophet is dearer to us than our wealth our children our fathers our forefathers our mothers and cool water at the time of severe thirst
502548 is always full of fear about things on which i shall be questioned on the judgement day i am sure this is not one of them so i do not think much about it
502549 patience is to faith as the head is to the body
502550 your eyes are even smaller yet they behold the world
502551 say come close i will recite what your lord has forbidden you i do not associate anything with him ii and show kindness towards both your parents iii do not kill your children because of poverty we shall provide for you as well as for them iv do no indulge in shocking acts which you may practice either openly or keep in secret v do not kill any person whom god has forbidden except through due process of law he has instructed you in this so that you may use your reason vi do not approach an orphans estate before he comes of age except to improve it vii grant full measure and weight in all fairness we do not assign any person to do more than he can cope with viii whenever you speak be just even though it concerns a close relative ix fulfill gods agreement thus has he instructed you so that you may bear it in mind x this is my straight road so follow it and do not follow other paths which will separate you from his path thus has he instructed you so that you may do your duty
502552 islam teaches that god is one and only reality not just that there is only one god but that nothing else really exists we have made gods of money status name fame and many other concerns that are only transient temporal and incapable of giving us the lasting peace that we all seek

502556 in the mosque there is a circle halaqah in which the people are looking at fiqh
502557 can knowledge be taken from a man who has not to his credit any seeking of knowledge nor sitting with scholars
502558 my father said knowledge is only that in which one says so and so told us
502559 o my lord the stars have come out people have gone to sleep and kings have closed their doors but your door is open every lover is alone with his lover but here i am standing before you
502560 o allah this night is ending the day is coming and i wish i knew whether you have accepted the night of worship from me so that i could congratulate myself or if it has been rejected so that i might console myself
502561 when you come upon the meadows of the garden graze in them
502562 a servant should overcome his soul and be continuous in the remembrance of his lord establishing the rights of his lord focusing upon him with his heart the light of fear setting ablaze his heart whilst drinking from the vessel of pure love and certain hidden realities being unveiled for him so when he talks it is due to allah when he speaks it is from allah when he moves it is by the command of allah and when he is serene then it is from allah he belongs to allah is for allaah and is with allah
502563 would you like to see a place even more wonderful than this
502564 we are looking for someone who was drowned in the sea and so became a martyr she never slept at night not one wink we are going to rub funeral spices on her body
502565 part of this spice and the fragrance of it clung to her body but then she shied away
502566 your prayers are your light your devotion is your strength sleep is the enemy of both your life is the only opportunity that life can give you if you ignore it if you waste it you will only turn to dust
502567 why do you refuse to pay us when you used to pay our forefather
502568 when your forefathers used to come their clothes were old and torn their hair was disheveld and their eyes were streaked with red due to worshipping throughout the night yet their faces were so awe inspiring that we were able to raise our eyes toward them your characteristics are not like theirs nor will be as just be gone we will not give you anything
502569 they breed what will they ultimately bury they build what will eventually be destroy they hold firm to what is emphemeral and they forsake what is everlasting hence blessed are the two cries people abominate most death and poverty

502572 he earned that by his patience with his little daughters and his family burdens

502574 humankind an admonition has been sent from your lord it is a balm for all that ails the heart a source of guidance to grace the true believers so let them rejoice in the bounty of allah it transcends what they hoard
502575 o prophet of allah may my father and my mother be sacrificed for you do not raise your head lest you be struck by an arrow shot by the enemy my neck is before your neck
502576 fear your sins more than you fear the enemy as your sins are more dangerous to you than your enemy we muslims are only victorious over our enemy because their sins outnumber ours not for any other reason if our sins were equal to those of our enemy then they would defeat us due to their superior numbers and resources
502577 why should i not cry when one of my doors to paradise has now closed
502578 i was informed by the heavenly hosts of angels that the most dignified among my followers are people who rejoice in public when they ponder the vastness of allahs all encompassing mercy and compassion and they weep privately when they contemplate rigorous punishment he reserved for the sinners and the deniers of the truth they sit in his blessed mosques morning and evening worshipping him and celebrating his praises inwardly and they implore him with their tongues outwardly with reverence and awe they pray to him with their hands raised as well as lowered and they yearn for him unceasingly they take little from people and yet it bears heavily on their hearts they walk barefooted humble unpretentious and unnoticed just like ants without finery and they are free of self adulation they walk with dignity and serenity and they rise to the nearness of their lord through their link to his messenger salallahu alayhi wasalam they wear the garment of good conduct and follow the clear proof they read the quran regularly take their daily guidance from it and they happily make the necessary personal sacrifices to meet its requirements almighty allah has surrounded them with distinguished witnessing angels and faithful guardians and he has illumined their faces with effulgence as a sign of his blessings upon them and as a demostration of his satisfaction with them when they look at his servants they anticipate promising signs they often contemplate the vastness of allahs creation their bodies dwell on earth and their eyes are anchored upon the heavens their feet stand on earth and their hearts dwell in the heavens they breath on earth and yet their spirits are connected to the divine throne their souls live in this world and their thoughts are focused on the hereafter they only worry about what may come their graves are in this world and their ranks are exalted in allahs sight

502580 i want to be back helping the raiders push for a finals berth this season
502581 if they want to sack me then ill have to sit back down with my manager dave riolo and my family and discuss what could happen
502582 the worst result we spoke about is that the nrl could de register me which means id have to go overseas
502583 but my priority is to work things out with the raiders and get back playing this year
502584 this was an inhumane act by the bloody separatist terrorist organisation
502585 i hit the ball really badly on the back nine but it was very windy and quite difficult
502586 im glad todays over but its only the third round im not too far behind and there will be lots of birdies to be made tomorrow
502587 i followed his advice and didnt feel under too much pressure
502588 now i just hope it is the same tomorrow sunday
502589 im looking forward to the last round and being in the past pair again
502590 i got to four under and hoped i might get to five or six and really get back into it but it was not to be

502597 it is very disappointing to see the new cabinet list
502598 the new cabinet cannot give thais any hope in dealing with the economic situation
502599 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on
502600 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
502601 five minutes later a strong gas smell took over the dormitories followed by the deafening explosion we felt the flames rise up around us
502602 from day one ive thought it seems like hes troubled
502603 i would like to understand why he has done this if he had a change of heart then certainly we would want to sit down and listen to him
502604 we would want to see him back in the nrl and we would want to see him happy if sonny was to say hes sorry for what he did and admit that he made a mistake we would definitely be a party to hearing him out
502605 if sonny bill were to play overseas certainly the door would be closed on his returning to the nrl at any time in the future
502606 my brother and i get into an argument with a taxi driver about getting our change back he got on his mobile phone and all of a sudden at least 15 greeks with baseball bats batons and chains appeared out of nowhere
502607 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
502608 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
502609 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
502610 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye
502611 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
502612 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
502613 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
502614 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
502615 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
502616 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
502617 we dont have anything thats logical and connected and to tackle obesity you need to be able to go somewhere which has all the modern treatments and that includes bariatric surgery
502618 on all the evidence that i have seen the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
502619 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately
502620 my role as federal environment minister is to make decisions based on the best possible outcome for the australian environment
502621 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
502622 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
502623 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
502624 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
502625 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
502626 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
502627 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
502628 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
502629 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
502630 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
502631 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
502632 i had writers block and felt like i had nothing left to say until after the fire

502707 we realised the time was finally right in russia to begin investing in the internet
502708 up until that point there was limited broadband penetration and ad spend moving from print and tv the first thing that came up on our radar was the fact the fourth largest website in russia was owned by this company in america that had no idea how it had emerged there
502709 the three major mobile players here are just falling over themselves to get broadband market share its play now or forever be marginalised economically the countrys doing very well and even better when compared to the doldrums of the us and western europe media buyers in russia are more imaginative and more demanding of innovative advertising tools than elsewhere in the world because the russian market is big and daunting everyone outside was hoping theyd come in and acquire yandex mail ru or rambler but it never happened
502710 in russia it goes a step further its much more about politics the quality of posts is so high that we actually consider to be a kind of mass media itself
502711 were also poking our nose in kazakhstan at the moment

502720 they made a lot of progress overnight cleaning up the debris now they are getting to some of those extremely large boulders so there will some blasting involved to get them down to size
502721 theyre too large to move with the heavy equipment onsite so we may have to blast those but we are very confident we will have the highway open sunday we cant be more specific because of the blasting
502722 the whole cleanup has been a combination of a lot of resources throwing everything they have at it
502723 once the debris is removed we can start on that it will require some repaving definitely that in itself is not a huge obstacle
502724 staff are absolutely confident they would not have gone in to remove that debris if they hadnt been 100 per cent confident of the rock face
502725 that rock face along with other areas along the corridor will continue to be monitored now that a whole lot of that rock has been released it probably makes it a little bit more safer in a perfect world wed do it in a more controlled fashion but there was nothing to suggest that a slide of this magnitude was going to happen
502726 but they also had some bloops and bunts i thought paul did ok
502727 plus its always hard to see here for some reason
502728 i didnt want to get that close to the strike zone with that slider and i left it right down the middle
502729 and that pretty much sums up my location the whole day when the ball was up they got hits when i made my pitches i got ground balls it was just me kind of out of sync and not making my pitch but it happens im still confident going into the next one
502730 that early wed like to keep the lineup in our favor
502731 paul didnt get the pitch where he wanted and they got a hit out of it
502732 if we wait in a rank for 30 minutes and then get a short trip from one end of collins street to another it is not financially feasible
502733 we had a larger grad class last year so weve had more students completing their degrees which leaves more students to enroll
502734 its not in our plan to over enroll this year
502735 people are looking at our price and seeing that its a great value given uconns quality
502736 its good for us and good for our students given the economy
502737 the cost of rice has more than doubled and the costs of basic things like milk are going crazy
502738 we found a need that students at uconn had and tried to fill it
502739 it gives students more flexibility in terms of who they can live with
502740 i decided to live in gender neutral housing last year because i wanted to room with one of my guy friends and this was a great opportunity to do so
502741 living with someone of a different gender really does allow you to get a different perspective on things every once in a while when one of us would come home with a problem we would all talk it out together
502742 the difference in points of views and problem solving approaches were huge and always really helpful
502743 when you lose someone like tonya who has been here for 14 years and has meant so much to our players staff and program it is not an easy role to fill
502744 i know that shea is the one person who can come in that will know exactly what uconn basketball is what the expectation is what type of player we want to recruit and how to coach and treat them once they are here
502745 if you want the best deliciousness to cost ratio it would probably be changs garden
502746 the only other cost effective option is really dominos and quite frankly i get sick of it chinese food always greasy always cheap always great im a big fan of the moo shu
502747 they deliver pretty late so when you come back from that party and youre drunk you can just call
502748 they have really good tabouli and hummus and really good chicken pockets for people who arent as adventurous
502749 i could eat there three meals a day everything there is really fresh and you dont have to feel guilty since nothing there is bad for you
502750 the white pizza in particular its pretty cheap cheaper than d p dough and its a big pizza
502751 if i have to choose i guess im a liberal
502752 we are extremely pleased to have angela leading the uconn womens lacrosse program
502753 her experience both as a head coach and assistant coach combined with her participation as a student athlete at northwestern university brings a wealth of knowledge about the sport to our university angela is committed to academic success the development of student athletes and the overall enhancement of our lacrosse program
502754 dont let fear keep you from trying new things or talking to new people that is a big part of college

502762 so i came up with this idea and then collaborated with several experts in the proposed areas
502763 theres progress being made i wouldnt say as much as id like at this point so were going to continue to push him

502774 he has helped on the distance and i think 50 per cent of what i have done is because of the caddie
502775 i dont think i have enough power to play on the lpga like physical condition
502776 im happy for what he did and hes a great player and he seems like the greg norman of old
502777 but ive got to go out there tomorrow and play golf and i dont think greg norman is going to help me around so i have to do it on my own
502778 but this is my position there is nothing i can do about it i have nothing to lose i hope to get a good start tomorrow and we will see
502779 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
502780 today was a little better more regular golf i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
502781 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow

502792 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
502793 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
502794 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
502795 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
502796 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney

502829 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

502831 for all the problems we face if you ask americans what frustrates them most about washington they will tell you they dont think were capable of serving the public interest before our personal and partisan ambitions that we fight for ourselves and not for them americans are sick of it and they have every right to be they are sick of the politics of selfishness stalemate and delay they despair when every election no matter who wins always seems to produce four more years of unkept promises and a government that is just a battleground for the next election their patience is at an end for politicians who value ambition over principle and for partisanship that is less a contest of ide as than an uncivil brawl over the spoils of power they want to change not only the policies and institutions that have failed the american people but the political culture that produced them they want to move this country forward and stake our claim on this century as we did in the last and they want their government to care more about them than preserving the privileges of the powerful there are serious issues at stake in this election and serious differences between the candidates and we will argue about them as we should but it should remain an argument among friends each of us struggling to hear our conscience and heed its demands each of us despite our differences united in our great cause and respectful of the goodness in each other that is how most americans treat each other and it is how they want the people they elect to office to treat each other if i am elected president i will work with anyone who sincerely wants to get this country moving again i will listen to any idea that is offered in good faith and intended to help solve our problems not make them worse i will seek the counsel of members of congress from both parties in forming government policy before i ask them to support it i will ask democrats to serve in my administration my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability i will hold weekly press conferences i will regularly brief the american people on the progress our policies have made and the setbacks we have encountered when we make errors i will confess them readily and explain what we intend to do to correct them i will ask congress to grant me the privilege of coming before both houses to take questions and address criticism much the same as the prime minister of great britain appears regularly before the house of commons we cannot again leave our problems for another unluckier generation of americans to fix after they have become even harder to solve im not interested in partisanship that serves no other purpose than to gain a temporary advantage over our opponents this mindless paralyzing rancor must come to an end we belong to different parties not different countries we are rivals for the same power but we are also compatriots we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association i intend to prove myself worthy of the office of our country and of your respect i wont judge myself by how many elections ive won i wont spend one hour of my presidency worrying more about my re election than keeping my promises to the american people there is a time to campaign and a time to govern if im elected president the era of the permanent campaign will end the era of problem solving will begin i promise you from the day i am sworn into office until the last hour of my presidency i will work with anyone of either party to make this country safe prosperous and proud and i wont care who gets the credit

502836 do the math obama has made clear he will sign every piece of pro abortion legislation that comes to his desk and appoint pro abortion justices to the supreme court who will never overturn roe v wade every unjust death is tragic but the holocaust of abortion far outweighs the iraq war and our nations need for a unifying leader
502837 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
502838 he will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation will not take up sword against nation nor will they train for war anymore

502846 what mccain has is likeability a quality that reagan had in spades at least for americans obama may not be so quite so well endowed in that department polls show that older women are not at all as enamoured of him as younger women he has a serious problem with women over 50 a category that traditionally turns out to vote perhaps they are not so ensnared by the glamour and charisma or perhaps they have just become too jaded and cynical

502848 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
502849 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
502850 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
502851 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
502852 it is a new low for the international community to see all these state leaders going to beijing without saying anything about the repressive environment in which the games are being held
502853 thousands of people including petitioners who have gone to beijing seeking justice from the government have been swept up in efforts to clean up the city before the games
502854 they said they were hired by the hospital and surveillance will last for the next four months it is said the olympics are approaching so they worry about us petitioners
502855 the police come to my place waiting outside and i do not know what they want to do with me

502865 it does well on marginal land were looking for growers who have soil that is marginal there are literally millions of acres in oregon where the soil is marginal

502895 i did this on my own without any prior discussion with dustin turner he did not encourage me in any way and in fact i remember one instance while i was choking jennifer dustin trying to pull my hands away
502896 were always concerned about what the other side has to say against us
502897 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty

502915 predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future
502916 alarmists have adopted the position that all extremes of weather cold warm wet or dry are all due to global warming
502917 the record snows severe weather and heavy rainfall have been the result of rapid cooling in the northern tier of the united states and canada not global warming

502945 the question of power has been settled by the elections
502946 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
502947 we have been beating about the bush and we have been spending a lot of time sharing and listening to each other

503013 for casual or periodic traders i would advise against entering this market a person could always get lucky once or twice but saying they could replicate that longer term is not likely

503229 on all the evidence that i have seen the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
503230 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately
503231 i have got some really meaningful innings in my life but the whole situation with so many disappointments since readmission in 1991 its bigger than just us i would have to say this is my best
503232 we got off to a good start but before we knew it we were in trouble i started taking it 10 runs at a time and took it ball by ball
503233 the biggest reward we could receive is to see a psychopath like yourself behind bars
503234 my brother and i get into an argument with a taxi driver about getting our change back he got on his mobile phone and all of a sudden at least 15 greeks with baseball bats batons and chains appeared out of nowhere
503235 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
503236 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
503237 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
503238 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye

503242 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
503243 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
503244 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
503245 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
503246 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
503247 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
503248 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
503249 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
503250 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
503251 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
503252 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
503253 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
503254 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
503255 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
503256 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
503257 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
503258 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric

503293 the last 24 hours weve been removing debris from the road area and were probably about 70 per cent complete from getting rid of all that broken rock thats on the road in conjunction with that process and that operation we are still looking at scaling that northern part of the slide zone so we still have a little bit of cleanup on the slope

503298 es grav sima la situaci n que se est creando all pues est resurgiendo un conflicto que pensamos estaba cerrado
503299 what we perceive is not god but his effects rays of light in the first instance and the thick darkness beyond being in the second
503300 unto this darkness which is beyond light we pray that we may come and may attain unto vision through the loss of sight and knowledge and that in ceasing thus to see or to know that is beyond all perception and all understanding for this emptying of our faculties is true sight and true knowledge and that we may offer him that which transcends all things the praises of a transcendent hymnody
503301 in proper truth we do but use the elements and syllables and phrases and written terms and words as an aid to our sense inasmuch as when our soul is moved by spiritual energies unto spiritual things our senses together with the thing which they perceive are superfluous when our soul becoming god like meets in the blind embraces of an incomprehensible union the rays of unapproachable light
503302 alone has immortality and that he dwells in unapproachable light whom no man has seen or can see
503303 i am the light of the world he who follows me shall not walk in darkness but have the light of life
503304 you cannot see my face for no man shall see me and live
503305 here is a place by me and you shall stand on the rock so it shall be while my glory passes by that i will put you in the cleft of the rock and will cover you with my hand while i pass by then i will take away my hand and you shall see my back but my face shall not be seen

503325 therefore there are roughly 225 000 more people living with h i v in the u s than previously suspected
503326 the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
503327 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
503328 u s efforts to prevent h i v have failed dismally
503329 this paper has been scrutinized by some of the best statisticians in the country and is much better now than when we started this process it was so complicated that even i who has some expertise in this area could not stand by it without making sure we had gone through the review process
503330 this is one of those examples where getting the external review process to really scrutinize the paper pick it apart build it back up has in my opinion fundamentally improved it
503331 h i v prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
503332 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation c d c s prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for h i v prevention at c d c
503333 had less and less money to actually get these programs to the communities that need them
503334 it looks like prevention campaigns make even less difference than anyone thought
503335 h i v incidence did not decline as much from the 1980s to the 1990s as we believed
503336 despite the dramatic increase in condom promotion and so called prevention education
503337 a dejar sus trabajos en escritorios y comenzar a ser activistas
503338 no nos pidan que demostremos lo que los expertos deben de hacer nosotras no necesitamos estudios sofisticados para reafirmar lo que los ojos pueden ver y los o dos pueden escuchar

503341 se enfrentan a situaciones de violencia y abuso por parte de autoridades traficantes de personas y asaltantes otras se ven orilladas al trabajo sexual otras intercambian relaciones sexuales para incrementar probabilidad de xito en su trayecto
503342 tr gicamente como todos sabemos millones de vidas de mujeres ahora est n siendo afectadas
503343 tenemos la oportunidad hoy en este punto de la historia en 2008 en ciudad de m xico de verdaderamente hacer una diferencia y trabajar conjuntamente
503344 sin nuestra acci n estaremos enfrentando la desaparici n de muchas generaciones algo que podemos verdaderamente evitar
503345 reconocer y trabajar juntas para facilitar que la sociedad entienda qu significa esta pandemia
503346 no soy experta ni pol tica soy artista escritora y comunicadora y tambi n madre y creo que las madres y los hijos tienen derecho a tener un porvenir
503347 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
503348 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
503349 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
503350 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
503351 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
503352 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
503353 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
503354 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
503355 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way
503356 distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era
503357 theres just a handful of us left but it has become easier for us domestic folks to compete
503358 this is not just about steel but also maple syrup and avocados and blueberries at the grocery store
503359 avocado salad in minneapolis in january is just not going to work in this new world because flying it in is going to make it cost as much as a rib eye
503360 being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money
503361 green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down
503362 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
503363 they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production
503364 despite everything the american economy is still the biggest rottweiler on the block
503365 but if its expensive to get products from there to here its also expensive to get them from here to there
503366 no hay nada que me quite el sue o me parece justo que todos quieran jugar aqu hay una competencia enorme
503367 me toca elegir a once jugadores y estoy convencido de lo que hago todos quien jugar y hay competencia lo cual es lo importante
503368 debemos estar atentos esto reci n empieza y el torneo va a ser competitivo por lo que el equipo tiene que responder
503369 hasta el ltimo segundo que falte para que concluya el tiempo de los poderes extraordinarios es v lido para sancionar alguna ley
503370 fraude ser a si se estuviese violando la constituci n o estuviese el presidente legislando fuera del tiempo establecido y esto no ha ocurrido
503371 una manera de legislar completamente ajena a las formas democr ticas
503372 se trata de decretos que tocan temas de inter s colectivo en materias muy variadas sin que haya habido posibilidad alguna de discusi n
503373 las leyes no pueden entrar en vigencia sin estar publicadas la decisi n de promulgarlas divulgando solamente sus t tulos es un exabrupto desde el punto de vista pol tico y de los valores democr ticos
503374 no quiere que haya debate no quiere que los diputados critiquen p blicamente los art culos de las leyes ni que la poblaci n comprenda el alcance de lo que ha promulgado
503375 we need to take care of it for our tourism industry but the big problem is not on the beach its whats happening in the seas
503376 human caused stresses including global warming and overfishing are encouraging jellyfish surpluses in many tourist destinations and productive fisheries
503377 in the past few years the dynamic has changed completely the temperature is a little warmer
503378 creating a natural barrier that keeps the jellies from the coast
503379 im a little afraid to go back in the water
503380 right now i cant tell if i have hands or not they hurt theyre numb they itch
503381 there are more every year we saw hundreds offshore today
503382 you just have to learn how to handle the stings
503383 i too came to know about it this morning on television
503384 there is a problem with the proxy servers security certificate
503385 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
503386 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
503387 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personal
503388 we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
503389 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations
503390 so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
503391 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man
503392 he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pick up trucks
503393 i was personally responsible for transporting and getting out all families from afghanistan to pakistan
503394 were planning more expense cuts but were also investing in new features both in print and on the web new web sites and niche products
503395 we will weather this storm and get back to the profitable business our shareholders expect
503396 i think the primary reason that youre doing worse from a financial point of view is that you have a baghdad bureau
503397 some of the other papers dont even have a state capital bureau anymore
503398 he just looked worried depressed anxious way turned into himself
503399 it would be overstating it to say he looked like a guy who was being led to his execution but its not far off
503400 almost everybody believes that he had absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax
503401 we thought he worked out really well he was a critical part of our vaccine studies
503402 most of the time he was very happy and outgoing
503403 he did good work he was very conscientious and he worked long hours to get the work done
503404 awards are nice but the real satisfaction is knowing the vaccine is back on line
503405 he would tell stories about how he would come home and everything he owned would be in piles
503406 has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions plans threats amp actions toward therapists
503407 son candidaturas que han contado con un gran respaldo de firmas patrocinadoras y eso nos tiene contentos en algunos casos la ley nos exig a reunir 70 firmas y se juntaron m s de 100 eso habla de un respaldo creciente

503413 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo

503426 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
503427 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa

503436 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
503437 i think its an important risk but frankly im more concerned about bombs and guns which are easily available and can be very destructive
503438 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
503439 the federal bureau of investigation and the intelligence community were the ones who were most concerned about it
503440 one well placed student technician or senior scientist no cost with the salary being provided courtesy of the u s taxpayer and no risk no difficulty
503441 adherence to institute safety procedures by laboratory personnel is lax
503442 you can never say that the system is 100 percent secure
503443 but the research ethic today is one of much greater disciple and focus on security than was true prior to the anthrax attacks
503444 you have all these universities tripping over each other trying to be high level biosecurity labs
503445 what the nation gets is a very expensive bill less security and a greater risk to the surrounding communities

503454 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
503455 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n

503489 estaba revisando una encuesta que viene del exterior y la mayor parte de los bolivianos plantea socialismo me qued impresionado si el pueblo boliviano nos pide socialismo vamos a profundizar el socialismo
503490 yo escuchaba al compa ero ch vez patria o muerte no entend a ahora quisi ramos gritar todos los d as patria o muerte
503491 hasta el ltimo segundo que falte para que concluya el tiempo de los poderes extraordinarios es v lido para sancionar alguna ley
503492 fraude ser a si se estuviese violando la constituci n o estuviese el presidente legislando fuera del tiempo establecido y esto no ha ocurrido
503493 una manera de legislar completamente ajena a las formas democr ticas
503494 se trata de decretos que tocan temas de inter s colectivo en materias muy variadas sin que haya habido posibilidad alguna de discusi n
503495 las leyes no pueden entrar en vigencia sin estar publicadas la decisi n de promulgarlas divulgando solamente sus t tulos es un exabrupto desde el punto de vista pol tico y de los valores democr ticos
503496 no quiere que haya debate no quiere que los diputados critiquen p blicamente los art culos de las leyes ni que la poblaci n comprenda el alcance de lo que ha promulgado
503497 en ese momento lleg mi mam y me ayud a echarle agua para que el beb se fuera por la letrina
503498 ronaldinho ha tra do un gran entusiasmo hemos hecho otros 20 000 abonados m s desde su llegada hemos alcanzado los 33 000 m s de los que tuvimos tras la victoria en la liga de campeones
503499 kak seguir en el mil n el jugador tiene contrato es in til desestabilizarle
503500 no soy yo quien tiene que valorar c mo est n las negociaciones lo nico que puedo decir es que como futbolista no tenemos ninguna duda el resto son detalles del club que est trabajando y hay que ver c mo termina esto y hasta d nde llega
503501 sab amos desde el principio que iba a ser un tema complicado que no iba a ser f cil que un jugador como cristiano llegase al real madrid
503502 si le preguntas a todos los entrenadores todos te dir n que lo quieren es un jugador que todo t cnico quiere tener en su equipo un gran jugador con la exigencia del real madrid de ganar todo cada a o necesita a los mejores
503503 hay un inter s por este jugador pero no s si est firmado no tengo esa informaci n todav a
503504 he hablado con l y sabe perfectamente que es una parte importante de nuestro proyecto es un jugador fundamental no estamos pensando en ning n momento que se puede ir est trabajando hoy ha jugado sus primeros minutos en los que se ha visto lo que es robinho me parece perfecto que muchos est n interesados
503505 personalmente me habr a gustado que jugase en un primera en espa a hab a posibilidades pero hay que aceptar la decisi n del jugador sin duda el f tbol ingl s es tambi n una escuela importante para los j venes espero que avance y mejore en muchas cosas
503506 todav a nos cuesta coger un ritmo bueno durante muchos minutos del partido pero tenemos calidad para decidir hay que sufrir ante equipos m s rodados como el hamburgo que en dos semanas empieza su liga y se nota
503507 no nos gusta que de juana est en la calle pero respetamos escrupulosamente la ley
503508 behenna has been charged with premeditated murder assault making a false official statement and obstruction of justice

503511 behenna has been charged with premeditated murder assault making a false official statement and obstruction of justice
503512 por nuestra parte no tenemos inter s en llevar esta estrategia lo mejor que podemos hacer es seguir hacia adelante
503513 estaba en union minnesota que es 98 blanco y rural y lo que dije fue lo que todo el mundo sabe que no me parezco a un candidato tradicional
503514 nadie pens en aquel momento que estaba hablando de algo racial
503515 no creo que john mccain sea un racista creo que es un c nico
503516 creo que quiere distraer a la gente de los problemas reales
503517 contrariamente a lo que piensa los que me critican blancos y negros nunca he sido lo bastante ingenuo como para pensar que podemos superar nuestras diferencias sociales en un ciclo electoral o con una sola candidatura sobre todo una tan imperfecta como la m a
503518 me preocupa bastante escuchar a los asesores de mccain decir que todo se limita a criticar a obama y acusarle de no estar listo para asumir los mandos del pa s
503519 esta carrera tambi n es sobre mccain y su capacidad de liderazgo
503520 no nos gusta que de juana est en la calle pero respetamos escrupulosamente la ley
503521 no nos gusta que de juana est en la calle pero respetamos escrupulosamente la ley
503522 no afirmamos que la justicia internacional sea incapaz estamos a la espera de ver qu hace en el tpi a n no ha habido ning n juicio pero nos preocupa que la violencia sexual sea siempre la ltima prioridad
503523 hace falta que el fiscal del tpi vaya m s al terreno que hable con las v ctimas ahora mismo las v ctimas nos dicen la justicia internacional existe en teor a pero no para nosotras
503524 cuando se crearon los tribunales especiales para juzgar lo ocurrido en ruanda y en la ex yugoslavia la violaci n ni siquiera estaba definida como un cr men de guerra o de genocidio en los estatutos que detallaban los delitos de los que se iban a ocupar ambos rganos
503525 fue la propia jurisprudencia la que incorpor esa definici n
503526 ahora mismo el tribunal penal internacional tiene los instrumentos para perseguir la violaci n como crimen contra la humanidad
503527 en el terreno la actividad de los tribunales internacionales no ha mejorado la situaci n las violaciones siguen ocurriendo con total impunidad
503528 es m s cuando hay un avance en un caso en un tribunal internacional como la reciente petici n de que se procese al presidente sudan s la situaci n empeora hay una reacci n y las ong que denuncian la violencia son m s perseguidas que de costumbre
503529 un aspecto de la justicia internacional en relaci n a la violencia sexual en el que hay un vac o y es cuando los abusos sexuales o las violaciones las cometen miembros de misiones de paz de la onu o el propio personal humanitario
503530 en el caso del personal de la onu se supone que los sospechosos son reenv ados a sus pa ses de origen para juzgarles all normalmente nunca se vuelve a o r hablar del tema eso supone un descr dito para las misiones y es otra manera de consagrar la impunidad
503531 no nos gusta que de juana est en la calle pero respetamos escrupulosamente la ley
503532 no nos gusta que de juana est en la calle pero respetamos escrupulosamente la ley
503533 at some point we will use up all our fossil fuel but this will still be here
503534 there was not one drop of fertilizer used on this crop
503535 this crop is directly related to your pump the feasibility of this crop is dictated by the number that shows up on the pump the higher the price at the pump the more feasible this is
503536 and thats a good thing for oregon farmers actually northwest farmers
503537 and this is a crop that can grow easily and nicely on dry land
503538 it does well on marginal land were looking for growers who have soil that is marginal there are literally millions of acres in oregon where the soil is marginal
503539 this is not a food staple like corn wheat or soy beans
503540 southwest oregon area is prime climate for camelina there are also a lot more low producing soils than high producing soils here
503541 even if it comes out on the positive side you still have to weigh it against other commodities
503542 i am in utter shock and disbelief that we as a community and a city government would allow this type of thing to go on
503543 this is kind of a game of whack a mole for police agencies in lane county
503544 if they deal with a problem here they have to stop dealing with a problem over here
503545 but i think its a good start down that road
503546 i can guarantee you if this was one of their children or one of their family they would come up with something
503547 if there was somebody would have thought about it 20 or 30 years ago
503548 zawahri has been killed by them several times but once again this claim is wrong this is baseless
503549 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
503550 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
503551 our judgment is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist terror group
503552 its a very disciplined organization but with a very large freedom of action when they get a policy directive they have certain room for maneuver keeping the interests of the state in view
503553 prosecution and defense closing arguments in us versus hamdan are now scheduled for monday morning
503554 we are less concerned with their public comments than we are with actions on the ground in china
503555 the first stars were very different from stars like the sun
503556 it has been in the family since around 1760 and it belonged to a benedictine convent before that
503557 hey what the hell are you doing here were all over at niksnexus net weblog
503558 its pretty cool because ive seen a lot of change in him so far
503559 weve already got our butts chewed out a few times for that
503560 adding insult to injury it appears you are wading into this debate on very shaky procedural and legal grounds while the fcc has endorsed certain internet policy principles it has never adopted regulations through a proper notice and comment rulemaking nor should it for the reasons i outline above nonetheless your continued pursuit of this matter suggests that you are making not only a poor policy judgment but a poor legal one as well
503561 i know you dont like this but im proud of you for sticking with it
503562 then youre quite likely to end up throwing more food away
503563 if plastic in general and plastic packaging in particular is all about facilitating our current way of living will i have to return to the labour intensive shopping patterns of previous decades to complete my non plastic mission im about to find out
503564 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future
503565 bahkan mungkin jibril pun dititahkan tidur dan tak mencampuri segala yang terjadi dalam silaturahmi indah ini
503566 kalau mau sultan ngamid bisa menghilang kalau mau segala yang ada di rumah karesidenan ini bisa dikutuk menjadi batu nah apakah sampean mau dikutuk jadi tengu
503567 sampean juga jangan menatap wajah sultan jenderal kalau berani menatap hati sampean bisa terbakar
503568 mengapa saya tidak diperkenankan pulang jenderal apa yang harus saya lakukan di sini saya datang dengan bersahabat semata mata untuk kunjungan singkat sebagaimana yang diadatkan oleh orang jawa setelah mereka selesai berpuasa selama sebulan 3 saya datang tidak dengan keris terhunus dan pedang meradang
503569 jadi anda ingin mengadili saya anda ingin mengajak berkelahi jika itu yang jenderal inginkan saya tak membutuhkan keadilan dari tangan sampean jika ingin berkelahi saya pun tak mau berkelahi dengan sampean
503570 saya akan mempreteli kekuasaan sampean dengan cara apa pun pangeran kalau perlu saya akan menggorok leher perempuan perempuan terkasih anda pada lebaran hari ketiga setelah itu saya tembak putra putra sampean dan jangan lupa haji ngisa dan para panakawan juga kami jebloskan ke sumur tua
503571 hei jenderal ketahuilah saya yang sejak dulu sampean panggil sebagai pangeran dipanegara 4 tidak takut mati saya siap dibunuh kapan pun kematian toh hanya kabut halus kematian toh hanya tirai yang memungkinkan saya menyatu dengan istri saya di imogiri sekarang silakan bunuh saya saya yakin inilah puncak kemenangan yang saya peroleh setelah sebulan berpuasa
503572 apakah sultan tak mengerti akan terjadi peristiwa seperti ini kisanak
503573 allahu allahu allahu segalanya telah rampung gusti segalanya telah kukembalikan pada mu
503574 jangan katakan kepada siapa pun apa yang sampean lihat saya percaya sampean tak akan menyebarkan sesuatu yang mungkin bisa menyesatkan umat ketakjuban sampean tahu kadang kadang bisa menjauhkan kita dari sang penabur keajaiban
503575 ya ya sampean boleh khawatir namun saya lebih khawatir jika prajurit kita akan mengejutkan mereka
503576 jadi kita hanya akan bersilaturahmi berlebaran pada jenderal de kock sultan
503577 ya jangan kaukenakan tanda pangkat atau jabatan kenakan saja pakaian santai sebagaimana kita hendak pelesir atau berjalan jalan
503578 kita memang akan bersilaturahmi sultan tetapi de kock telah menjelma iblis dan sebagai iblis dia akan membunuh siapa pun yang tak takluk pada dirinya
503579 iblis kitalah yang iblis kalau tak bisa memaafkan orang orang yang hendak membunuh dan memperdaya kita
503580 segalanya sudah diatur oleh sang jenderal sialan tetapi mengapa sultan percaya bahwa apa pun yang terjadi telah diatur oleh tuhan dan tak lagi bisa dihindarkan
503581 pada saat berperang pikirkanlah peperangan namun pada saat lebaran pikirkanlah lebaran ayolah bersenang senanglah bersama jenderal de kock dan para perwira nanti kuberi kuda baru nanti kuberi sajadah dan sorban baru nanti

503588 akhir akhir ini begitu sedikit umat hamba yang masuk surga
503589 ahk itu kan biasa kebanyakan mereka dari daerah tropis kalau tak salah
503590 kemarau kelewat panjang di sana terik matahari terlalu lama membakar otak otak mereka yang bodoh
503591 umatmu banyak kena tusukan siar matahari sebagian besar berubah ingatan lainnya pada mati mendadak
503592 ada stempel kalimat syahadat dalam paspor mereka terpaksa raja iblis menolak memberikan visa neraka untuk orang orang malang itu
503593 tentara neraka memang telah merantai kaki kaki mereka di batu nisan masing masing
503594 apa dosa mereka gerangan betapa malang nasib umat hamba ya tuhan
503595 nasakom racun apa itu ya tuhan iblis laknat mana meracuni jiwa mereka muhammad saw nampak gusar sekali tinju mengepal usman umar ali asah pedang kalian tajam tajam
503596 carilah sendiri fakta fakta yang otentik tentang pedang pedang itu kurasa sudah kurang laku di pasar loak pelabuhan jedah pencipta nasakom sudah punya bom atom kau tahu
503597 tentu saja mintalah surat jalan pada sulaiman yang bijak di sekretariat tahu sendiri dirasai botes polisi polisi dan hansip hansip paling sok iseng gemar sekali ribut ribut perkara surat jalan

503601 orang bumi bilang sputnik ada tiga orang di dalamnya ya rasul
503602 bukan mereka justru rakyat negara kapir terbesar di bumi pengikut marx dan lenin yang ingkar tuhan tapi pandai pandai otaknya
503603 orang orang malang semoga tuhan mengampuni mereka berdoa aku ingin lihat orang orang kapir itu dari dekat ayo buroq
503604 diumumkan bahwa sputnik rusia berhasil mencium planet yang tak dikenal ada sedikit gangguan komunikasi
503605 paduka salah duga di bawah kita bukan neraka tapi bagian bumi yang paling durhaka jakarta namanya ibukota sebuah negeri dengan seratus juta rakyat yang malas dan bodoh tapi ngakunya sudah bebas b h
503606 tak pernah kudengar nama itu mana lebih durhaka jakarta atau sodomah dan gomorah
503607 bukan paduka itulah barisan sukwan dan sukwati guna mengganyang negara tetangga malaysia
503608 sama sekali tidak 9o persen dari rakyatnya orang islam juga
503609 90 juta umatku muslimin dan muslimat yang tercinta tapi tak kulihat mesjid yang cukup besar di mana mereka bersembahyang jumat
503610 soal 90 juta hanya menurut statistik bumiawi yang ngawur dalam catatan abubakar di surga mereka tak ada sejuta yang betul betul islam
503611 tidak hanya berubah ingatan kini mereka akan menghancurkan negara tetangga yang se agama
503612 ayo jibril segera kita tinggalkan tempat terkutuk ini aku terlalu rindu pada medinah
503613 tapi bangsa di bawah sana telah menabikan orang lain lagi
503614 nasakom jadi tempat inilah sumbernya kau bilang umatku takluk nonsense
503615 sabda allah tak akan kalah betapapun islam ia ada dan tetap ada walau bumi hancur sekalipun
503616 mohon ssegera dikirim tabib tabib cina yang kesohor pemimpin besar kami sakit keras mungkin sebentar lagi mati
503617 semoga lekas sembuh bersama ini rakyat cina mengutus beberapa tabib dan dukun untuk memeriksa penyakit saudara

503619 tak apa baik buat ginjalnya biar kencing batu pym tidak kumat kumat
503620 ya mati paling tidak lumpuh kawan mao berpesan sudah tiba saatnya
503621 tapi ajarannya tidak nasakom bahkan telah mengoroti jiwa prajurit prajurit telah mendarah daging pada sebagian kiai kiaiku
503622 kenapa kau pilih bentuk burung elang ini dan bukan manusia pasti kita akan dapat berbuat banyak untuk umatku
503623 paduka harap ingat di jakarta setiap hidung harus punya kartu penduduk salah kena garuk razia gelandangan
503624 ya untuk mengikuti gerak hati dna pikiran manusia justru sulit bila satu dengan mereka
503625 dan dalam wujud yang sekarang mata kita tajam gerak kita cepat
503626 akh ya kau betul tuhan memberkatimu jibril mari kita keliling lagi betapapun durhaka kota ini mulai kucintai
503627 di negeri dengan rakyat islam terbesar mereka begitu bebas berbuat cabul
503628 mungkin pengaruh adanya nasakom sundal sundal juga soko guru revolusi
503629 ai binatang hina yang melata mereka harus dilempari batu sampai mati tidakkah abu bakar umar dan usman teruskan perintahku pada kiai kiai di sini berzina laangkah kotor bangsa ini batu mana batu
503630 batu batu mahal di sini satu kubik 200 rupiah sayang bila hanya untuk melempari pezina pezina lagipula
503631 batu batu seluruh dunia tak cukup banyak guna melempari pezina pezinanya untuk dirikan masjid pun masih kekurangan paduka lihat
503632 tidak paduka hamba tetap sadar dengarlah penuturan hamba kelak akan lahir sebuah sajak begini bunyinya

503706 we are not issuing any statement as sean was not involved in the incident he was one of several celebrity guests in attendance at this party
503707 for us this is just another regatta of the quebramar gp42 cup but without any doubt it is the mediterraneans most important we didnt have a brilliant start in the championship but thanks to our team work we managed to recover which is an even greater satisfaction i would like to dedicate our victory to our technical director agust n zulueta because we are here thanks to him
503708 its with great joy that we repeat last years victory in palma in valencia we had some speed problems with the boat but thanks the effort put by the entire team we were able to solve them es una alegr a poder repetir la victoria del a o pasado this edition of the copa del rey offered us stupendous racing and an impeccable organization
503709 first of all i would like to congratulate the spanish team for its victory in the gp42 class of the copa del rey they had an excellent regatta and kept us thrilled until the end with no less than 4 boats battling for a podium spot i think its important to stress the fact the winner has a boat from last year able to compete on the same level in one of the most difficult regattas of the circuit

503715 memang aku delat dengan boss tapi bukan hanya itu dengan semua orang yang ada dikantor ini aku dekat mulai dari pesuruh kantor karyawan bahkan jajaran pimpinan aku kenal baik dan sangat dekat kok kamu bertanya demikian kamu pikir aku ber nepotisme untuk mendapatkan semua ini
503716 bukan gitu aku cuma kagum aja sama kamu masih seusia aku udah berhasil menduduki jabatan yang bagus bukankah itu suatu prestasi yang luarbiasa
503717 aku tidak punya rahasia apapun aku hanya cukup meng aktualisasi diri ku atou fokus pada kekuatan yang aku punya dan berusaha mengurangi kelemahan kelemahan yang aku miliki itu saja mudahkan

503719 i liked it when those old computers gave me tumors
503720 i am a serious foodie an avid gardener and a crazed entrepreneur
503721 a retarded garage mechanic who copies out of car toons magazine
503722 there are always one or two songs on an album that are misfires
503723 the third track on eternal nightcap is a shocker its called love is everywhere and i cant believe that album did so well when it had such a stinking piece of failed pop on it
503724 im not a huge fan of my stuff i think i have had my moments i think i have had some great phrases but i havent reinvented the wheel musically
503725 i remember when i released eternal nightcap i wanted to sell 10 000 records and be able to do two nights at the annandale hotel which was about the equivalent of the evelyn
503726 i dont get too sad because much time has passed and i just remember the good times i acknowledge how lucky i was to meet them
503727 i think when you write something in the month or two after losing someone or when you are in the grieving process it is like going to a therapist really you just have to get it out
503728 i dont think one necessarily needs to get it out with a song you just need to talk to friends share stories lie in fetal position for four weeks or sing a song
503729 i still love what i am doing and i intend to do it for a long time but i intend to do it a bit less
503730 having to do 150 shows a year where as soon as you walk into the job there are 24 beers two bottles of wine and a bottle of vodka your job is to artificially create adrenalin in yourself so you are in the same state as the audience who are having their one night out in three weeks
503731 luckily i decided to be a little bit careful before it got too late
503732 if you wait until you are around 40 until you have a kid you have laughed at everything in the world by then and suddenly this thing arrives that makes you laugh in very different ways
503733 i still live on my own and still have fun and still like getting with the gang and going around the country and we dont drink cups of tea backstage
503734 but as in anything its all about balance and you just have to treat everything with moderation and still be able to get up at 7am midweek when the daughter is staying
503735 they are musicians after all and generally pretty relaxed people and they like a drink
503736 they are in showbiz we are all carnie folk so i am not as uncomfortable in an orchestras presence as i imagined i would be but i havent worked with the mso yet apparently they are the real deal so i may just have to doff my hat keep to myself and try not to make any mistakes
503737 they were trying to replicate pictures in the studio says sneakys angus mcdonald
503738 jake said hed introduced the song to kylie and they ended up playing it 20 times a day it became the inspiration for the new record
503739 i dont want your body i want everything the song says
503740 we sent it to her publisher they had every songwriter in the universe submitting to them he says
503741 we never knew whether it actually got to kylie we didnt hear back after two weeks so we kept it
503742 all the songs are inspired by connie being around this time mcdonald says
503743 when you know whos performing the song that becomes the inspiration
503744 but almost love and loss and a few happy endings
503745 it doesnt end as a listener you are not boxed in its a main course meal of pheasant goose and turkey then you want to put your pudding on the plate as well there is no end know what i mean
503746 i think my life is a constant of that lack of resolution i like it that way i never want to be boxed
503747 you could see him thinking yeah right im really taking a meeting set up by two white boys
503748 i think they were expecting a low standard mitchell says
503749 it was a tough assignment we walked in and he was playing this sappy rnb song super sweet with 100 vocal tracks
503750 i was thinking what the hell is she going to sing over this
503751 i was in the control booth looking at angus he had this look on his face like bring it home connie bring it home
503752 connie didnt know who kanye west was i had to say trust me youll probably want to sing on his record
503753 and its a grammy winning record thats not a bad outcome
503754 i got my face in the paper a few times downey says sheepishly
503755 you get off the plane and you get your picture in the paper how do you do that
503756 i get my picture taken in the supermarket in the dairy section mainly
503757 well i was playing the guitar and these two guys walked up and found me mitchell says
503758 its random one idea and another idea pieced together to make no sense at all perfect
503759 a few of those girls on a farmer wants a wife look all right
503760 what was i thinking did i close my eyes and think of jennifer hawkins
503761 he is not his brothers keeper he is his own man ed is not to be held accountable for his brothers actions
503762 the question isnt whether a few policies or a new face will get the voters listening but whether we really believe labour is still the party that britain needs
503763 those of us who are part of labours team have a job to do to show why labours values are as important today as they were 11 years ago nothing else helps or matters
503764 i support what david said in his article he has identified the way forward for the party
503765 were running a little behind so im just gonna have you get started while the waiters are passing out dessert

503774 mythic college girlfriend who broke chucks heart slept with his best friend bryce larkin and is basically responsible for setting his life crashing off course and landing him at the nerd herd
503775 he always has imagined seeing her again and being able to impress her with all hes accomplished unfortunately when he does meet her hes doing a computer install and shes a brilliant successful beautiful doctor working to create antibodies to horrible diseases
503776 the part is funny romantic theres action and cool twists and emotional drama
503777 its the juiciest arc weve done yet and one that ties very deeply into the mythology of the show and the character of chuck
503778 but they said i was allowed to do as much as i wanted except for serious things
503779 we actually play with this going right into the first episode this season which is this idea of when the government rebuilds the intersect computer chuck will become expendable and it will be left to casey adam baldwins character to disappear him as they say in the nsa and obviously for a guy like caseys whos all about his job his burgeoning feelings of friendship towards chuck could begin to complicate that
503780 philosophers have only described the world in various ways the point is to change it
503781 im telling you as soon as they step into a room together the magics there when they look at each other its like sparks fly its something you cant manufacture
503782 its a very good stand alone story it doesnt involve aliens or mythology and you dont have to know anything about the whole conspiracy story that we had for many many years but it is good scary and creepy and actually involves their characters and their life
503783 in part three i think it would probably have to do with aliens i think we would have to go back to that kind of mythology and get to the heart of what mulder was looking for

503787 the policy at the moment is that you have to play in the previous competition to the all blacks team being named and by that we usually mean the super 14 before the tri nations or the air new zealand cup before the november tour
503788 the prospect of him coming back and playing for say otahuhu for two weeks before becoming an all black is not the way we do things
503789 so even if we relented and said were going to pick players from offshore we wouldnt get them now
503790 wed ended up picking two very different all blacks one for the iveco series in june and the november internationals because those are the two windows and another team for the tri nations because thats outside the window
503791 were not ignoring the possibility but at the moment theres a very clear policy not to do it
503792 were are very concerned by the advice we have received as to the date of the french final and thats a matter well be taking further
503793 we arent happy with it and well be speaking to the irb and the french about it as will the australians
503794 its too early to make a bullish statement about that but its a continuation of the issue around release of players from europe

503796 everyone is entitled to their own opinion no one is entitled to their own facts
503797 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something im running to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things im running for president to protect our country from harm and defeat its enemies im running for president to make the government do its job not your job im not running to leave our biggest problems to an unluckier generation of leaders but to fix them now and fix them well
503798 they had a little more pull than south carolina did
503799 thats the way it is and we understand it we need to dobetter than 6 6
503800 theres a huge difference between 8 4 and 6 6
503801 but at 6 6 maybe it was good for us in a way because as a head coach ive got to look and say hey how can we get better
503802 we were young and we hadnt been there but you see what happened and you learn from your mistakes
503803 this is a new year and were going to do everything we can to make sure we finish strong
503804 we feel like with ellis and better players were going to play better on defense
503805 watching our team go into a slump and not being able to play i wanted to pull my hair out
503806 it was a very tough situation but i think well be able to rebound
503807 thats the main thing right there to have all three phases of the game playing well every week
503808 weve got ballplayers weve got absolutely no excuses about ballplayers
503809 we need to coach better and theyve got to play like good players
503810 but when you see south carolina run out on the field for warm ups youre going to say those guys look like an sec team now
503811 we need to give him every opportunity to see if he can take us a long way
503812 hes very smart he can run he can make all the throws he just hasnt played that much yet
503813 but we havent done enough to gain a whole bunch of confidence
503814 we havent quite done enough yet ive always been a big believer youve got to expect some big things to happen before you can achieve it
503815 but if were lucky enough to be in position dont be afraid to think were as good as the other guy
503816 the spiritually lethal message communicated by our governor as well as many other high profile catholics in public life has been in effect the churchs teaching on abortion is optional
503817 i am happy for the children who have an opportunity to experience new trier on a daily basis shouldnt all children have the same opportunity
503818 when a public school fails parents ask only for a choice in the education of their children no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity
503819 when the intersect is rebuilt chuck becomes obsolete and expendable
503820 the government wants him to disappear and that mission falls to casey
503821 theres a catastrophic event at the end of the season premiere
503822 were coming out with all guns blazing were not saving anything
503823 when are those that are running state governement going to come up with an aggressive jobs policy in illinois that will keep and create jobs across the state

503828 well it looks like it was more than flesh wound charlie theres a gaping hole the size of kansas that the csi boys found in back of her head right over yonder
503829 this is a very important occasion not just a party
503830 we live in a hypocritical society even if people dont say they dislike you for being gay they never quite accept you
503831 it is about showing that we are here that it is time that lesbian women who walk hand in hand in the street are not gawked at or spat on as happened to a friend of mine
503832 we are here to show that being a pink family is ok
503833 the parade serves a dual purpose to celebrate that we can be who we are and that we can do it in the open and to be visible building acceptance of homosexuality
503834 we are here for the party but also for the struggle
503835 the number of incidents of discrimination and of violence against gay people has increased in the past year
503836 it is time to stop talking about tolerance and focus instead on acceptance of sexual differences in amsterdam
503837 as gay people we still get the feeling that we want to be more open but it is difficult to do so in the workplace on the sportsfield
503838 society still expects of gay people to behave normally society needs to start accepting that we add value through our differentness
503839 jennifer pushes me out of bed to go and check on the twins if they are crying absolutely
503840 we share the parenting responsibilities we are a team i love being a dad and that is a big part of it my family is strong and my foundations are good and they give me so much energy so i have energy to look after them and energy to work i am on top of the world right now
503841 i have decided to get back into the studio and work on releasing my very first full length album that will be dropping this winter i dont know the exact date yet but just know that i am busting my butt off to make this happen for all of you i cant wait to let you all hear the new songs and the new direction i have taken with these songs
503842 next up i am almost done now with writing my very first book ever writing this book has been so much fun for me because i got to answer all of your questions and emails regarding sex love relationships life and everything else in between this book will be an explosion full of my personality and an awesome way to connect with my fans my book hooking up with tila tequila will also be out in all stores this december
503843 i just think the photographer got a bad shot of her or it was touched up to make her look bad i saw madonna two days before at her rehearsal and she looked amazing glowing skin and working really hard on her show
503844 so do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us there are other forces at work in this world frodo besides the will of evil bilbo was meant to find the ring in which case you were also meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought
503845 i dont feel i look that different to when i started on the show
503846 i dont think im any different but maybe im kidding myself the thing is that there is nothing definite to say how old each of the characters is people just know how old the actresses are and i think these opinions are drawn from that unfairly in my opinion
503847 eh i think ill stab thi stranger to death and then cut off his head and show everybody
503848 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
503849 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody laying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
503850 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
503851 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
503852 its a big concern for the officers to keep this guy out of traffic to keep him from getting hurt

503873 consistent with respect for human rights the practice of tolerance does not mean toleration of social injustice or the abandonment or weakening of ones convictions it means that one is free to adhere to ones own convictions and accepts that others adhere to theirs it means accepting the fact that human beings naturally diverse in their appearance situation speech behavior and values have the right to live in peace and to be as they are it also means that ones views are not to be imposed on others

503876 the eu was concerned about the overall approach taken in this resolution this resolution stressed one religion above all others
503877 the concept of defamation could easily be abused by extremists to censure all debates on religious freedom
503878 it is troubling the degree to which questions of racism and questions of religious intolerance were mixed in that resolution in such a way that did not promote a greater understanding of the relationship between the two issues rather confused them
503879 i want to destroy someone i want to make him feel soryr that he was ever born on this earth
503880 the ideations symbols behaviors values and beliefs that are shared by a human group
503881 in order to learn to teach in a society that is increasingly culturally and linguistically diverse prospective teachers as well as experienced teachers and teacher educators need opportunities to examine much of what is usually unexamined in the tightly braided relationships of language culture and power in schools and schooling this kind of examination inevitably begins with our own histories as human beings and as educators our own experiences as members of particular races classes and genders and as children parents and teachers in the world
503882 many of us european americans today are ignorant of our ethnic history because our ancestors worked so hard to dismantle their european identity in favor of what they perceived to be the american ideal from the moment they arrived on american soil they received a strong message forget the home language make sure your children dont learn to speak it change your name to sound more american or if the immigration officials cant pronounce it theyll change it for you
503883 systematically construct a working definition of culture that will guide decision making in planning instruction for different populations of students
503884 diminishing childrens sense of belonging to the dominant culture that is uniquely american
503885 an adverse judgment or opinion formed beforehand or without knowledge or examination of the facts
503886 an avertive or hostile attitude toward a person who belongs to a group simply because he belongs to that group and is therefore presumed to have the objectionable qualities ascribed to the group
503887 prejudice may be reduced by equal status contact between majority and minority groups in the pursuit of common goals the effect is greatly enhanced if this contact is sanctioned by institutional supports and provided it is of a sort that leads to the perception of common interests and common humanity between members of the two groups
503888 denial of the differential weight given to human characteristics across cultures such as skin color religious affiliation or gender ignores a reality that most children have observed and often integrated into their own social attitudes and behavior

503958 yes youre going to go get dressed were going to a party in the gryffindor common room and youre going to have fun even if i have to slip a few potions in your butterbeer now get moving
503959 i dont think so but you have fun with that assuming you stay more than five minutes before dragging ron off somewhere private
503960 ron likes it when i dress like this now go get dressed were leaving in three minutes
503961 no non nyet nein n i it was nice noing you have i made myself perfectly clear yet or would you like me to start branching out into some of the really odd languages i learned while training
503962 youre not going to win this hermione im not going to the party unlike you i actually take care of my head duties and im not talking about what ron asks you to do in every dark corner of the school he can manage to drag you into
503963 this isnt what she would have wanted for you harry
503964 ginny has been for three months hermione three months i loved her we were engaged to be married and voldemort tore her apart in front of me for his own sick amusement and then then i tore him from the fabric of reality in revenge he didnt die or anything i made him cease to exist and yet when i was done with that ginny was still gone so no hermione dont try and tell me what ginny would have wanted because what she would have wanted for me doesnt matter shes dead and despite all the power i have at my fingertips i cant change that i cant bring her back
503965 just stop trying hermione im going to go start rounds try to keep to either rons room or the head girls room tonight im getting tired of having to explain certain entries on the point deduction log to professor mcgonagall
503966 i hope dumbledore is right and death is the next great adventure because id hate to think youre as bored as i have been lately
503967 havent talked to your brother in weeks unless you count him arguing about it when i take points from him for public indecency the harpy came after me again tonight wanted me to go to some party i would have bat bogeyed her but itd remind me too much of you nevilles already getting work offers from a few famous greenhouses which is helping take the stress off newts for him
503968 lunas still crushing on me and shows up in the oddest places but shes a real friend and i dont have many of those anymore so i guess im stuck with her she doesnt try to make me talk like hermione and its really nice to be able to talk as much or as little as i want to without being psychoanalyzed for it and theres something actually flattering about her being interested in me unlike the fan girls although i wish you and luna hadnt tagged along with hermione for that lingerie shopping expedition at the start of her slag phase do you know how hard it is to resist a pretty girl in frilly knickers and nothing else waiting for you in your bed
503969 wait she probably got the idea from you after all thats how you finally got me to loosen up and shag you huh i am really ashamed for not figuring that one out sooner
503970 i just wish you were here my parents died sirius died remus died you died if i get too close to luna shell probably die too whats the point of having all this power if i can use it to save strangers but not the people i love i know its not supposed to be but life isnt fair and i hate it
503971 if this is some kind of sick joke im going to kill the person responsible in a way so painful voldemort would have watched on in awe

504049 you measure democracy by the freedom it gives its dissidents not the freedom it gives its assimilated conformists
504050 if the concepts enemy and fear constitute the energetic principles of politics a democratic political system is impossible whether the fear is produced from within or without if freedom is absence of restraints the restraints to be removed are many but the psychological restraint of fear ranks first
504051 if democracy is such a good thing lets have more of it
504052 we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we cant have both
504053 capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are in principle under autocratic control thus a corporation or an industry is if we were to think of it in political terms fascist that is it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be established at every level just as im opposed to political fascism i am opposed to economic fascism i think that until the major institutions of society are under the popular control of participants and communities its pointless to talk about democracy
504054 behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people to destroy this invisible government to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day
504055 and it seems to me perfectly in the cards that there will be within the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods
504056 the real difference between democracy and oligarchy is poverty and wealth wherever men rule by reason of their wealth whether they be few of many that is an oligarchy and where the poor rule that is democracy
504057 our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others
504058 neither is poverty a bar for a man may benefit his country whatever be the obscurity of his conditions there is no exclusiveness in our public life and in our private intercourses we are not suspicious of one another nor angry with our neighbor if he does what he likes we do not give him sour looks which though harmless are not pleasant
504059 i believe democracy to be of all forms of government the most natural and the most consonant with individual liberty in it no one transfers his natural rights so absolutely that he has no further voice in affairs he only hands it over to the majority of a society whereof he is a unit thus all men remain as they were in the state of nature equals
504060 the tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in a democracy
504061 democracy restores to man a consciousness of his value teaches him by the removal of authority and oppression to listen to the dictates of reason gives him confidence to treat all other men as his fellow human beings and induces him to regard them no longer as enemies against whom to be upon his guard but as brethren whom it becomes him to assist
504062 there never was a democracy that did not commit suicide
504063 there are but two parties there never have been but two parties founded in the radical question whether people or property shall govern democracy implies a government by the people aristocracy implies a government of the rich and in these words are contained the sum of party distinctions
504064 the principal advantage of a democracy is a general elevation in the character of the people the vulgar charge that the tendency of democracies is to leveling meaning to drag all down to the level of the lowest is singularly untrue its real tendency being to elevate the depressed to a condition not unworthy of their manhood
504065 there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy the basic things expected by our people of their political and economic system are simple they are equality of opportunity for youth and others jobs for those who can work security for those who need it the ending of the special privileges for the few the preservation of civil liberties for all the enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living
504066 the inevitable outcome of democracy is the control by the people themselves not only of their own political organization but through that also of the main instruments of wealth production the gradual substitution of organized cooperation for the anarchy of the competitive struggle the economic side of the democratic ideal is in fact socialism itself
504067 there is only one sort of genuine socialism the democratic sort by which i mean the organization of society for the benefit of the whole people
504068 democracy a government of the masses authority derived through mass meeting or any other form of direct expression results in mobocracy attitude toward property is communistic negating property rights attitude toward law is that the will of a majority shall regulate whether it is based upon deliberation or governed by passion prejudices or impulse without restraint or regard to consequences result is demogogism license agitation discontent anarchy
504069 the death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination from ambush it will be a slow extinction from apathy indifference and undernourishment
504070 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realisation of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights

504076 we have arrested a spy and have also registered fir against him we cannot reveal anything more because of security reasons as many agencies are involved in the investigations we will be holding a press conference on sunday
504077 i can do that see this card this is the fool thats you youre the star ive been looking for all these other people are just court jesters but youre the real thing
504078 facilities to be provided to passengers by airlines due to delay denied boarding and cancellation
504079 with the introduction of a large number of air operators and the ensuing competition among them to provide cheaper services it is likely that the interest of fare paying passenger is ignored and is denied certain basic rights a number of complaints are received by the ministry of civil aviation and dgca from the passengers against the treatment meted out by airlines this car is aimed at providing regulations in the interest of travelling passengers and the minimum facilities which must be provided to them
504080 digital media can be very compelling and powerful evidence it can even be overwhelming in the right circumstances
504081 thats the world we live in thats a fact of life everybody has a camera
504082 i tell all the protest groups that go out public places to have someone in their group with video camera
504083 just like a live witness any piece or source of evidence needs to be examined analyzed and challenged
504084 it is imperative to recognize that a photograph or video shows only one angle at a specific snapshot in time

504088 al kan ik nog steeds ken en steve laten switchen tussen mx1 en open indien dat om tactische of andere redenen nodig zou zijn
504089 die hebben haar een veilig onderkomen verschaft maar jammer genoeg de politie niet verwittigd
504090 na enig speurwerk kwamen we haar al gauw op het spoor
504091 ze had geen idee hoeveel mensen ze op de been heeft gebracht
504092 we hebben de hele nacht het vuur bestreden en het dorp gered
504093 het is ons gelukt de brand onder controle te krijgen
504094 we would not house someone who has finished the military commissions process back with the general detainee population they would be held separate from the other detainees
504095 whats the purpose here mr hamdan is going to be held until the government wants to release him
504096 why would i steal a title that i am going to win at the great american bash
504097 kurt angle your title shot match is tonight as much as i would love to wait i need a champion
504098 i wish you 2 the best of luck and may the best man be the world heavyweight champion
504099 now that the world heavyweight championship is found i know you are going to give me my rightful shot at the great american bash right
504100 not a chance you had your shot next friday i will host yet another 6 man battle royal for contendership you will be in that match
504101 whoever said that my motto was full of crap never wouldve guessed that it got me a title match at the great american bash i lied when i was asked did i know what happened to the world heavyweight championship i cheated to win this match and i am the one who stole the world heavyweight championship
504102 you are the idiot that stole the world heavyweight championship eddie are you stupid that is something that you say after your title shot that wouldve put you in a better advantage than the one you are about to be in seeing as how you are the one who stole the undertakers world heavyweight championship your match at the great american bash will be a hell in the cell match see you in hell
504103 umm do you want to me to get the other key
504104 well i guess well have to look elsewhere then just my two cents though rarely do i ever see anything other than large national international acts pull more than 200 people in the door in this town ive been to plently of very well known national acts that came through and they struggled to pull in more than 100 people like i said though just my two cents no hard feelings though well look elsewhere
504105 keep me in mind if you hear of any openings
504106 im looking for a job as a bookkeeper in the houston area waitress in the midtown neighborhood project manager in the construction industry
504107 do you know anyone in that area or line of work i could talk to
504108 there were no locks on the doors and you could pretty much wander the building without a lot of interference
504109 toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety
504110 there was a requirement to register the laboratory not the individual
504111 thats when locks went on doors and armed guards and the whole nine yards
504112 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions and plans
504113 i dont believe that reviewing a persons medical record is part of a typical security investigation unless there is an indication that theres a concern there
504114 and the alternative here is to have a much higher level of scrutiny for everybody in the system i dont particularly want investigators going through my medical records if theres not a reason a security related reason to do that
504115 what you see in the discovered portrait is a fairly detailed picture of a dutch rural lady very similar to those van gogh painted in the same period
504116 what the data actually show is that the 2006 estimate of roughly 56 000 new infections is substantially higher its about 40 percent higher than what had previously been estimated
504117 this stability in the presence of a growing population of hiv infected individuals is encouraging
504118 the data really confirm that the most severe impact of the epidemic continues to be among gay and bisexual men of all races and among black men and women
504119 when you have nearly flat funding for hiv treatment and care and reduced funding for hiv prevention it means were not doing what we need to do
504120 and it has the low string of the viola which i really love but its small enough that i can handle it easily
504121 cindy and i love to play swedish and norwegian traditional fiddle tunes in which the fiddlers play in harmony with each other
504122 its a beautiful sound and you can get four part harmonies going with just two people
504123 i was playing around with the number 52 and thinking what can i do with that
504124 and then realized i can divide it by four and you get 13 so i decided to write a song that had 13 beats per measure and four measures in each section and then youd have 52 beats in each section of the piece
504125 he was also too cheap to buy me a present
504126 we also put a few jokers in added a few measures with 14 beats we really advise people not to try to count it can kind of spoil a day
504127 the roots of traditional music go way back sometimes many generations
504128 but its a continuous lineage that has never stopped its an unbroken living tradition that is going through a golden age right now where people are learning the older tunes and then creating new tunes that enter back into the tradition its totally relevant to us and reaching out and understanding people in other cultures
504129 we saw a very special innings and over the series theyve been better than us we just havent batted well enough
504130 at 93 4 we were well in the game and thought the game was on our side but smith played a very very controlled innings
504131 its as good a knock as ive had played against me in terms of the context of the series
504132 we tried to throw everything at them i thought we bowled reasonably well at times and did put them under a lot of pressure especially when we got that flurry of wickets
504133 we batted on a decent wicket on the first day and only got 231
504134 the ball swung but we really should have got a few more than we did thats been a real worry for a long time now so there are areas and certainly the batting that weve got to look at
504135 england made us play really hard they put us under pressure and we had to come up with something special which we did
504136 i think england made us fight for this one we had to work hard at headingley and show a lot of discipline there to go 1 0 up which is the key in trying to get it sewn up before the last one
504137 i think if england had won this one the oval would have been very difficult for us
504138 id like to think it was my best knock for south africa in terms of the meaning that comes with it
504139 we saw a very special innings and over the series theyve been better than us we just havent batted well enough
504140 at 93 4 we were well in the game and thought the game was on our side but smith played a very very controlled innings

504156 obviously the last race i was lucky because of the safety car but you still need to be quick to keep the pace quicker than the ferrari
504157 everybody needs a little luck to win a race its normal
504158 every good day is always good for confidence but you have to remember that everyones going to be quicker tomorrow everyones going to be running lighter
504159 forget that we were second today and look to where we need to improve
504160 in the beginning it wasnt good at all i guess many drivers had trouble with graining so i dont think i was the only one
504161 it is difficult to understand how the tires are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as the rubber goes down on the track surface
504162 some epoch making progress in nuclear arms control and disarmament
504163 i am thinking of proposing in my nobel prize speech that the five nuclear powers meet to discuss an agreement to discuss the use of nuclear weapons and renounce first use
504164 frankly speaking the united states would be the only nation which refuses to take part in such a conference
504165 if we were to renounce the first use of nuclear weapons there would be a great danger for japan
504166 instead our policy is to continue to maintain stability while negotiating balanced reductions of strategic forces
504167 we are absolutely fascinated by cosplay costume play in japan
504168 we will absolutely have a good time at the parade japan is absolutely a crazy place
504169 i will give everything ive got in building a government that puts itself in the peoples shoes a foundation in which people can live without worry and an economic society in which the people can feel affluence
504170 and at the same time i will do my best to contribute to the peace and stability of the world and resolve the global environmental issues
504171 as a nation that actively cooperates to realize peace i will cooperate with the international society in the war on terrorism
504172 as a peace cooperating nation i will promote international cooperation like peacekeeping operations antiterrorism measures and rehabilitation aid
504173 to solve the two issues we need to continue economic growth for more employment and an increase in income
504174 plus if youre arrested for a copper theft theres not as much punishment
504175 we actively investigate all thefts or attacks on our property
504176 arrests of individuals involved in these thefts from georgia power have increased more than 900 percent
504177 we wanted to make recyclers report records to us every day like pawn shops do
504178 but there are state laws that prohibit us from doing that
504179 was paying people 50 cents to 1 per pound for whatever they sold her and she was bringing it to us
504180 we checked her certification and license and brought her in
504181 thieves were caught right in the middle of stealing the hot water heater
504182 but in the last year steel has been the thing to steal
504183 theres a lot of construction in india and china that makes this stuff more valuable
504184 wed put up chains on the driveway thinking that would deter them
504185 hes very instinctive youve seen the way he can play the ball his nickname is johnny on the spot
504186 its a game you play with your skills but you also need to play with your mind
504187 once you get things down you run around and play football like youre a little kid again you have to be very precise
504188 my dad was a proud person and the way he taught judo he wanted us to be the best
504189 my family is so strict and it was all about judo and any other sport was forbidden especially football because it was so violent
504190 my brother thought my personality would be a great fit for it and it certainly was
504191 in judo its a lot of hip turns and hip explosion i think it really helps my explosiveness and my quickness
504192 i dont know how many interceptions haruki has got but the ball finds him
504193 its funny but the same guys are always getting lucky he looks kind of like will demps but faster
504194 i was always one of those guys who people said was too small too slow or wasnt aggressive enough
504195 its kind of special its unique to be a representative of a group
504196 rushdie told the guardian that the book portrayed him as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant
504197 in my humble opinion i am none of those things i am not trying to prevent him from publishing this stupid book but if they publish it there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
504198 rushdies lawyer mark stephens said saturday that he had written to the publisher of on her majestys service the tell all not the bond novel demanding it withdraw the book which has not yet been published
504199 stephens who also does legal work for the associated press said he wrote to the books publisher john blake publishing ltd
504200 the metropolitan police said the force could not comment on evans allegations but said in a statement we regret that he chooses to publish this book
504201 fugitive clark rockefeller was taken into police custody in baltimore today his kidnapped daughter is safe and sound and in police hands law enforcement sources said details of his capture were not immediately clear
504202 of course i will be a little nervous and there will be huge pressure but i will do everything i can to get the first medal for japan
504203 i have to turn the pressure into power and make a good start
504204 i was unable to finish with a medal in athens my target is to succeed with all six lifts and if i do that i think good results will come
504205 my father and my uncle are both medalists and i will do my very best here as i want to join that club as soon as i can
504206 i wonder why the foreign ministry didnt communicate with local communities when it obtained the information
504207 since its about radioactivity i wish they had handled it properly
504208 if it began leaking in march why couldnt they have disclosed it much earlier
504209 it proves how sloppy that the governments inspection has been to completely resolve the issue we must bar port calls by all u s nuclear naval ships
504210 nuclear leaks are directly linked to peoples safety and it is a very serious issue this shows that the safety myth the u s navy has been boasting has collapsed
504211 just ahead of the deployment of a nuclear powered aircraft carrier such a radioactive leak following the announcement of the cause of a fire incident reveals lax management on the part of the u s navy and further intensifies anxiety among yokosuka citizens about nuclear powered aircraft carriers
504212 war has no true victors and people on all sides experience loss
504213 most of those interred here lost their lives whilst in captivity a time when they should have been under protection
504214 there is a saying that goes closing eyes to the past means closing eyes to the future
504215 a change that later occurred in the japanese market environment
504216 its wonderful that i can carry the flag for the swiss delegation on my birthday
504217 i still have a score to settle with the olympics and being handed this honor for a second time will give me extra motivation
504218 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
504219 and kobe takes on the challenge of guarding their best perimeter player regardless of who it is regardless if hes a point guard 2 3 4 whatever it is
504220 he had a great game against us a few years ago the u s a and was real brash about it
504221 i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
504222 sometimes a foreign katakana word or phrase enters japanese to replace a perfectly good native equivalent this makes something appear more attractive and trendy than it normally would
504223 these are two excellent baseball men class acts but we thought we needed a change we feel andy hawkins has been in the organization a long time knows our young pitchers thats clearly the direction were headed
504224 we felt we needed to try a different direction with the pitching staff a different voice a different message not that anything they were saying was wrong but sometimes players respond to different voices and were going to take that chance
504225 the toughest thing ive ever had to be a part of but sometimes youve got to go in a different direction
504226 i know im going to be no 1 getting no 1 is a present for a lot of work in the past so its satisfying
504227 the important thing is that i continue to play well continue to win
504228 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better
504229 i want to be healthy i want to improve i want to play tennis i dont really think about no 1 or whatever happens if its going to happen it will happen
504230 i want many people to know how the pilots felt when they wrote about their internal conflicts before leaving chiran on kamikaze missions
504231 we need to show a scenario and time frame on the burden we are asking of taxpayers to implement various policies for local governments and small and midsize companies
504232 if the government decides a further burden is necessary from the public it will be a great amount of money
504233 it will eventually be decided whether the hike will be in the form of income tax or consumption tax
504234 i understand that fiscal reform is extremely important but we cannot manage politics with only that in mind
504235 japan is a shame sensitive society and the majority of people support the idea of dying gracefully to pay for a crime
504236 we will explain to the people why we need to do this and thoroughly prepare
504237 india will be developing even further from now on and we must build good relations with it
504238 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
504239 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
504240 if kyokushuzan batbayar makes a breakthrough mongolia could expect more development assistance from japan which would cement his popularity at home
504241 clark although many things have changed you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being in our hearts i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way i also want to thank everyone for your help and reigh honey i love you and miss you so much remember youre always a princess
504242 markus has great hands excellent footwork nice touch from 15 17 feet and is a strong passer for his size
504243 he needs to improve on the defensive end and must get stronger and improve his endurance
504244 he has to lose weight he couldnt contribute much last year he had some issues early doing the right thing and once he got himself straightened out there he had to lose some weight i think hes still another 10 pounds away i think hes going to be a monster and hes got another two inches to grow
504245 they can call me that if they like but with respect to both the criminal facing execution and the victims family its a tactless remark
504246 i am in communication with the families of victims and they almost without exception want the death sentence carried out
504247 that it involves taking a persons life and that its an irreversible act how do i feel troubled pained but i do it for the sake of justice in a country under the rule of law
504248 is not only the individuals problem its societys problem as well for that very reason our approach to reducing crime should not be killing those who harm us
504249 we should keep violent criminals alive and conduct thorough research on them
504250 ill kill you and get another trial and as long as the trial lasts they cant execute me
504251 you cant imagine what it does psychologically to send a man to his death
504252 should keep in mind the high rate of recidivism and then consider why people are condemned to death in the first place
504253 there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players
504254 they let us do the work and develop the players and then they think they can just come in and offer him big wages but after they cannot come up with the transfer request
504255 we were destabilized by some clubs who did not respect the fair play rule in tapping up players
504256 i think we suffered from that at the end of the season we havent done that but that has been done to us
504257 i watched douglass pitching during the test and he looked fine he seems to be back to where he was two years ago and i think he will help us down the stretch
504258 i look forward to seeing him again even though this time it will be as an opponent
504259 browers a veteran with experience and we will use him out of the bullpen the carp front office and i thought we needed another pitcher with the injuries weve had to colby lewis and ryuji yokoyama so we signed him
504260 we judged there was no need to immediately report it since it would not have any impact on humans
504261 i believe the foreign ministry should report a matter of this kind immediately to the prime ministers office and make it public when it is notified by the u
504262 i watched the report on cnn and contacted the ministry
504263 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
504264 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
504265 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
504266 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there

504268 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
504269 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
504270 the high humidity and temperatures of summer just make it harder to sleep whats more dawn arrives earlier and people wake up before getting enough sleep
504271 protect childrens heads from accidents when they go to school or play in parks
504272 to recognize what happens when films cross linguistic frontiers and require bilingual interlopers
504273 what we need are translators who are unruly not transparently naked not sober but intoxicated positively abusive we want translators with attitude
504274 in an age where the experience of the foreign is valued abuse helps inject a palpable sense of the foreign
504275 abusive subtitling can be seen as a critique of dominant ideology
504276 the language should enter the ear as the image enters the eye
504277 i could not disagree more actually these prior subtitles were quite wonderful for the way they released certain effects into english that correspond to the generically tortured japanese of the film itself
504278 strong forceful translation that values experimentation one that tampers with usage
504279 corrupt subtitles disavow the violence while abusive translators revel in it the audience should be made aware of the experience of translation rather than oblivious to it
504280 most filmgoers dont want to be made aware of the dubbers and subbers they want to watch a movie
504281 is how the finest translators can be nurtured while protecting them from the twin forces of rationalization and domestication
504282 that had been in direct contact with the victims bodies
504283 i gently placed a dress on top of the artificial sun light box that i had brought from tokyo to allow the light to shine through it i found myself overwhelmed by the bright colors and textures of these high quality clothes countless threads of time drift in the light intersect and create fountains of memory all i can do now is to focus on the air that i share with the objects lying before me and press the shutter to capture that moment in time

504285 all we have in life is ourselves and what we can put out there every day for the world to see me is all i got
504286 we want people to enjoy the characters so that they get used to the lay judge system
504287 it is world class and the sound is superb but well to be honest its how the steinway makes me feel inside special
504288 i want to be in my best shape for the 100 and be perfectly tuned for the 200
504289 regardless of my opponents condition i intend to go all out for victory in the 100 too
504290 i want to knock opponents down by making as many tackles as possible
504291 everything is going according to schedule im excited i feel a great opportunity in being able to take on this challenge for an incredible record of winning gold even as a mom
504292 ill just do what im supposed to do and perform firmly in beijing
504293 and then the outcome will be determined by the judges

504296 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
504297 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
504298 wanted a veto over every single step of nuclear negotiations which is not acceptable they wanted me to behave as their bonded slave
504299 we have to solve our problems together we are a country of a billion people 70 percent of us are young and it is important to realize that the country is brimming with confidence
504300 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans

504306 sammantaget anser jag mig ha tillr ckligt underlag f r att kunna konstatera att det inte i obetydlig utstr ckning f rekommer obefogat v ld verv ld och ojuste beteende fr n ordningsvakters sida i samband med ingripanden mot krogg ster
504307 det finns tillr ckligt underlag f r att h vda att det tycks f rekomma att vissa ordningsvakter i inte obetydlig omfattning talar helt eller delvis osanning n r de h rs i m l r rande krogv ld
504308 det st r emellertid klart att de krogg ster som uts tts f r l gner fr n vakter samtidigt uts tts f r avsev rda risker i fr ga om r ttss kerheten i de bed mningar som domstolen har att g ra
504309 det som framkommit om r ttss kerhetsproblem n r vakter h rs i domstol r oroande det r sj lvfallet helt oacceptabelt om enskilda d ms oskyldiga p grundval av falska eller tillr ttalagda vittnesm l fr n krogvakter jag vill d rf r rekommendera rikspolisstyrelsen polismyndigheterna klagarmyndigheten och domstolsverket att verv ga vilka tg rder som kan beh va vidtas
504310 det fungerar inte s det vore d den f r karri ren

504316 det har gl mts bort att den grupp vakter som beter sig illa r en f rsvinnande liten minoritet som f r v ldigt mycket uppm rksamhet
504317 vid huvudf rhandlingen blev det pinsamt uppenbart f r mig hur vakterna h ll ihop och skapade en ber ttelse f r att motivera misshandel verv ld och kr nkande spr kbruk
504318 om jag h ll tyst och inte anm lde vakten skulle jag f g hem n r jag ist llet ville anm la det jag varit med om blev jag h nad och gripen

504401 el vuelco que ha dado la feb ha sido espectacular
504402 a m no me gusta perder la final contra rusia fue una oportunidad que dejamos pasar yo espero volver a tener una oportunidad as y aprovecharla la pr xima vez estados unidos llevan desde s dney sin lograr un oro y viene con respeto a estos juegos como nosotros les respetamos a ellos
504403 est claro que estados unidos va a presentar una gran selecci n se han dado cuenta de la importancia que tiene el baloncesto internacional y van a llevar a sus grandes jugadores pero nuestra selecci n est preparada para todo y si les ganamos seguro que lograremos una medalla
504404 hac a tiempo que no ven a con la selecci n y estoy muy contento de poder volver a ella es muy bonito poder disfrutar de una experiencia as poder volver a jugar con amigos los torneos ol mpicos siempre son dif ciles espa a s lo ha subido una vez al podio pero somos optimistas y vamos a ver hasta d nde podemos llegar
504405 ahora hay caras nuevas pero el talento es el mismo el feeling que tenemos sigue siendo el mismo a to es un t cnico consagrado tiene su filosof a y no nos ha costado demasiado adaptarnos a ella
504406 ahora somos tres bases diferentes unos de otros nos compaginamos bien yo creo que tenemos el equipo con m s talento de los ltimos a os con los jugadores que hay aqu casi cualquier sistema valdr a y los de a to son muy asequibles
504407 nosotros vamos con toda la ilusi n del mundo y con muchas ganas de hacerlo bien a todos los deportistas les gusta participar en unos juegos ol mpicos y nosotros queremos conseguir una medalla ol mpica y sumar la segunda para espa a tras los ngeles 1984
504408 el ambiente en este grupo siempre es bueno y eso es una de las cosas que m s atractivo hace venir cada verano a la selecci n que la gente que acude lo hace porque quiere nuestros resultados nos colocan entre los favoritos pero hay que dejar claro que a priori debemos tener respeto a todos los rivales desde el principio
504409 ir a los juegos es un sue o que hay que asimilar
504410 a n no tengo asimilado que ir a los juegos ol mpicos yo solo he estado entrenando y pensando en el trabajo diario a to es un gran entrenador que adem s tiene una virtud que no destaca a nadie por encima del resto trata a todos los jugadores por igual
504411 el formato del torneo es distinto al de otros a os y estamos en un grupo complicado as que iremos paso a paso aunque suene a topicazo es lo que hemos de hacer cualquier jugador que llega a la selecci n se adapta muy r pido a este equipo
504412 a m me gusta la forma en la que a to quiere que sus equipos se desenvuelvan en la cancha utiliza un sistema que hace pensar al jugador una filosof a que necesita que el jugador decida en la cancha que lea las jugadas y eso est bien
504413 lo m s positivo es que a los estados unidos no nos los encontraremos en el cruce como pas hace cuatro a os ni a china el anfitri n
504414 the anti boycotters object to trade unions such as nuj ucus and unison supporting a boycott of israeli produce and institutions
504415 but they have nothing to say against israeli actions which amount not only to boycott but to a blockade of palestinian produce institutions and education
504416 the effect of this has been to sanction illegality and allow israel to continue to reap the benefits of her misconduct
504417 this vigil is a protest against the hypocrisy of the anti boycott movement and the western powers who choose to reward rather than proscribe israels behaviour

504484 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
504485 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
504486 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
504487 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
504488 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead

504723 that the kingdom of heaven itself can be sown in mens hearts like a seed
504724 is often lost because of the hardness of mens hearts the timidity of their belief and the temptations of the world which sometimes allure them into political positions which they know in their hearts are wrong since they do not conform to the loving providence of god
504725 to keep sowing the seed no matter what the likelihood of success no matter how hard the sowing may be no matter how challenging the prospects of success keep sowing keep sowing in confidence that gods providence will provide the good soil do not give up your seed will reach it yet keep sowing because if you stop the people will perish
504726 the separation of families the harassment and profiling of u s citizens and legal residents the expanded use of detention against those who are not a flight risk or a danger and tragically deaths in the united states desert
504727 such a dangerous and unwelcoming atmosphere that immigrants and their families leave the united states because they have no other choice
504728 fanning the flames of intolerance xenophobia and at times bigotry
504729 such a national policy is doomed to fail because it underestimates the human spirit the spirit of hope that we celebrate in this gathering
504730 gives us the courage to place ourselves on the side of the good even in seemingly hopeless situations aware that as far as the external course of history is concerned the power of sin will continue to be a terrible presence
504731 despite the attacks on our position and on those we serve we must not lose faith as to the rightness of our cause and of our service to our immigrant brothers and sisters the church must remain a prophetic voice in an increasingly hostile wilderness defending her mandate given by christ to welcome the stranger
504732 while we are bound to respect our laws and not violate them we also are bound to correct unjust laws
504733 the terms rule of law and national security should no longer be used to justify the harsh and inhumane treatment of immigrants refugees or asylum seekers while we acknowledge the right and the need for our government to enforce the law we must remind our fellow americans that man made law does not permit the violation of gods law
504734 not turn the immigrant into the scapegoat for other crucial social issues nor a threat to security and stability
504735 the affirmation that all persons are equal well beyond the differences deriving from origin language and culture
504736 affirms the central role and sacred character of the human being independently from his her regular or irregular legal status the church is more and more convinced that making the most of the ethical religious dimension of migration is the surest way to reach also other goals of high human and cultural value
504737 from a trading perspective this market is as risky as it has been in about two years which means you can lose money in a hurry and thats for professionals
504738 for casual or periodic traders i would advise against entering this market a person could always get lucky once or twice but saying they could replicate that longer term is not likely
504739 the best stance is to sit back and let the oil world pass by let the oil market sort itself out
504740 we have a saying in the oil market when the data says the market is divided that goes dont just do something stand there thats how things are right now
504741 el vuelco que ha dado la feb ha sido espectacular
504742 a m no me gusta perder la final contra rusia fue una oportunidad que dejamos pasar yo espero volver a tener una oportunidad as y aprovecharla la pr xima vez estados unidos llevan desde s dney sin lograr un oro y viene con respeto a estos juegos como nosotros les respetamos a ellos
504743 est claro que estados unidos va a presentar una gran selecci n se han dado cuenta de la importancia que tiene el baloncesto internacional y van a llevar a sus grandes jugadores pero nuestra selecci n est preparada para todo y si les ganamos seguro que lograremos una medalla
504744 hac a tiempo que no ven a con la selecci n y estoy muy contento de poder volver a ella es muy bonito poder disfrutar de una experiencia as poder volver a jugar con amigos los torneos ol mpicos siempre son dif ciles espa a s lo ha subido una vez al podio pero somos optimistas y vamos a ver hasta d nde podemos llegar
504745 ahora hay caras nuevas pero el talento es el mismo el feeling que tenemos sigue siendo el mismo a to es un t cnico consagrado tiene su filosof a y no nos ha costado demasiado adaptarnos a ella
504746 ahora somos tres bases diferentes unos de otros nos compaginamos bien yo creo que tenemos el equipo con m s talento de los ltimos a os con los jugadores que hay aqu casi cualquier sistema valdr a y los de a to son muy asequibles
504747 nosotros vamos con toda la ilusi n del mundo y con muchas ganas de hacerlo bien a todos los deportistas les gusta participar en unos juegos ol mpicos y nosotros queremos conseguir una medalla ol mpica y sumar la segunda para espa a tras los ngeles 1984
504748 el ambiente en este grupo siempre es bueno y eso es una de las cosas que m s atractivo hace venir cada verano a la selecci n que la gente que acude lo hace porque quiere nuestros resultados nos colocan entre los favoritos pero hay que dejar claro que a priori debemos tener respeto a todos los rivales desde el principio
504749 ir a los juegos es un sue o que hay que asimilar
504750 a n no tengo asimilado que ir a los juegos ol mpicos yo solo he estado entrenando y pensando en el trabajo diario a to es un gran entrenador que adem s tiene una virtud que no destaca a nadie por encima del resto trata a todos los jugadores por igual
504751 el formato del torneo es distinto al de otros a os y estamos en un grupo complicado as que iremos paso a paso aunque suene a topicazo es lo que hemos de hacer cualquier jugador que llega a la selecci n se adapta muy r pido a este equipo
504752 a m me gusta la forma en la que a to quiere que sus equipos se desenvuelvan en la cancha utiliza un sistema que hace pensar al jugador una filosof a que necesita que el jugador decida en la cancha que lea las jugadas y eso est bien
504753 lo m s positivo es que a los estados unidos no nos los encontraremos en el cruce como pas hace cuatro a os ni a china el anfitri n

504847 wir best tigen den wechsel es ist eine sehr interessante herausforderung f r alparslan erdem man hat ihm bei galatasaray eine gute rolle in der mannschaft in aussicht gestellt nichtsdestotrotz ist sein abgang sehr schade weil er auch bei uns f r den erweiterten kreis vorgesehen war und eine perspektive vorhanden gewesen w re
504848 fakt ist auch dass bei uns auf der position hinten links ein gro er konkurrenzkampf herrscht und dar ber hinaus viele junge leute nachkommen von galatasaray gab es f r alle seiten ein reizvolles angebot dass sich f r uns finanziell sehr lukrativ gestaltete
504849 schlie lich habe ich hier eine sch ne zeit gehabt und mich sehr wohl gef hlt doch ich sehe bei galatasaray die bessere sportliche perspektive
504850 ein gro teil meiner familie lebt in istanbul so dass ich mich schnell zu hause f hlen werde
504851 wir h tten mit alparslan gerne weiter zusammengearbeitet und auch seinen vertrag verl ngert aber er hat den wunsch ge u ert zu wechseln diesem wunsch sind wir nachgekommen
504852 dieser wechsel zeigt erneut dass unsere ausgebildeten spieler immer auch interessant f r andere vereine sind
504853 das ist f r uns sowohl sportlich als auch menschlich ein gro er verlust aber ich kann verstehen dass galatasaray f r ihn eine gro e chance ist

504856 its a great question im not faced with it yet weve thought that through and we have plans to accommodate but ill cross that bridge when i come to it
504857 we went in a direction nobody was going simpler more affordable
504858 the retreat is a model for the nation of affordable treatment that works
504859 is it possible that there is a power that has more horsepower out there

504861 we wanted to create a dignified safe place to go away from the burning house of addiction

504865 he was a hero and a fighter and hes been a fighter for this country since then a fighter for his state ever since and a strong leader in the senate

504875 will be to work on improving the democratic party from the inside and pushing it towards greater progressivism
504876 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
504877 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
504878 its one thing to go out there making good pitches and guys get hits
504879 or maybe theres some close plays here and there some broken bat hits those things are going to happen the idea as a pitcher is to try to control the damage and not create those situations on your own
504880 he doesnt back off he gets after it and it shows even though early in the game at times he wavers a little bit boy he just collects himself digs in and does a heck of a job

504891 there are no quick fixes in this kind of environment
504892 a company that cuts back too much on serving sizes may lose customers that will never come back when the economy rebounds
504893 we had an over supply issue even before oil prices rose and the housing sector collapsed
504894 restaurants are doing the best they can to keep prices down
504895 beer and sports are about as recession proof as you can get

504897 seriously stop being ignorant yanks this is taking place in
504898 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall

504910 they have players like bhaichung who can change the game at any time there is no point in playing for a draw and taking a risk
504911 indias midfield was non existent in the first match it improved a little yesterday but if they stick to that kick and run style of football they would be doing a favour to their opponents turkmenistan players are taller and stronger and wont allow bhaichung any freedom in the air you have to create moves in the midfield to rattle them

504952 scripted attack that happens when you press some buttons in sequence
504953 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
504954 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
504955 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
504956 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
504957 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
504958 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
504959 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
504960 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
504961 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
504962 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
504963 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
504964 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
504965 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
504966 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
504967 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
504968 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
504969 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
504970 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
504971 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
504972 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
504973 behenna has been charged with premeditated murder assault making a false official statement and obstruction of justice
504974 premeditated murder accessory after the fact assault making a false official statement and obstruction of justice
504975 initially believed to have been released by coalition forces on or about may 16
504976 its been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so but slowly its leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it
504977 our technology is not nearly as sophisticated as theirs and had they been hostile he warned we would have been gone by now
504978 ive been in military and intelligence circles who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge yes we have been visited reading the papers recently its been happening quite a bit this is really starting to open up i think were headed for real disclosure and some serious organizations are moving in that direction
504979 there was no question whatsoever of any impropriety or illegal activity
504980 i see the commissions financial statements and they are above board they passed their state audit
504981 was not based on any allegations of illegal activities the boards decision was in the interests of effecting an orderly transition while providing mr carlson the ability to search out new opportunities
504982 its still the standard answer were going to go in another direction
504983 things they discuss in executive session they do not have to publicly disclose
504984 but we chose not to in this case its internal its a matter between the commission and their president its up to the board to decide who they want to run the commission its a personnel matter
504985 i can tell you that they the commission have done everything right legally
504986 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
504987 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
504988 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
504989 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
504990 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
504991 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
504992 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
504993 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
504994 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
504995 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
504996 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
504997 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
504998 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
504999 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
505000 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
505001 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
505002 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
505003 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
505004 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
505005 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
505006 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
505007 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
505008 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
505009 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
505010 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
505011 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
505012 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
505013 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
505014 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
505015 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
505016 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
505017 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
505018 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
505019 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
505020 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
505021 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
505022 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
505023 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
505024 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
505025 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
505026 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
505027 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
505028 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
505029 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
505030 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
505031 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
505032 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
505033 scripted attack that happens when you press some buttons in sequence
505034 fast horses fast money the complete guide to quarter horse racing
505035 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
505036 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
505037 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
505038 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
505039 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
505040 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
505041 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
505042 who are open to doing something on the production side
505043 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
505044 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
505045 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
505046 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
505047 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
505048 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
505049 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
505050 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
505051 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
505052 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
505053 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
505054 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
505055 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
505056 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
505057 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
505058 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
505059 they the bomb squad are investigating the office where the explosion occurred was not manned and so far there is no indication that anyone was injured

505162 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children

505240 as the gap between the i and the me deepens dissociation and alienation increase the subject that under torture was forced into the position of pure object has lost his or her sense of interiority intimacy and privacy time is experienced now in the present only and perspective that which allows for a sense of relativity is foreclosed thoughts and dreams attack the mind and invade the body as if the protective skin that normally contains our thoughts gives us space to breathe in between the thought and the thing being thought about and separates between inside and outside past and present me and you was lost
505241 torture is an obscenity in that it joins what is most private with what is most public torture entails all the isolation and extreme solitude of privacy with none of the usual security embodied therein torture entails at the same time all the self exposure of the utterly public with none of its possibilities for camaraderie or shared experience the presence of an all powerful other with whom to merge without the security of the others benign intentions a further obscenity of torture is the inversion it makes of intimate human relationships the interrogation is a form of social encounter in which the normal rules of communicating of relating of intimacy are manipulated dependency needs are elicited by the interrogator but not so they may be met as in close relationships but to weaken and confuse independence that is offered in return for betrayal is a lie silence is intentionally misinterpreted either as confirmation of information or as guilt for complicity torture combines complete humiliating exposure with utter devastating isolation the final products and outcome of torture are a scarred and often shattered victim and an empty display of the fiction of power

505243 the purpose of all coercive techniques is to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist regression is basically a loss of autonomy a reversion to an earlier behavioral level as the subject regresses his learned personality traits fall away in reverse chronological order he begins to lose the capacity to carry out the highest creative activities to deal with complex situations or to cope with stressful interpersonal relationships or repeated frustrations
505244 pain is also unsharable in that it is resistant to language all our interior states of consciousness emotional perceptual cognitive and somatic can be described as having an object in the external world this affirms our capacity to move beyond the boundaries of our body into the external sharable world this is the space in which we interact and communicate with our environment but when we explore the interior state of physical pain we find that there is no object out there no external referential content pain is not of or for anything pain is and it draws us away from the space of interaction the sharable world inwards it draws us into the boundaries of our body

505267 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field
505268 again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls on finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought it

505280 when was recently was it before or after his comments he made the other day which sounded an awful lot like he did support reparations
505281 obama doesnt have to support reparations the senate passed an apology admitting fault this past week now all thats left is the wealth redistribution 101

505310 under similar circumstances the president of the united states has to act for whatever is for the best of the country
505311 so you contend that the executive has unlimited power in time of an emergency
505312 he has the power to take such action as is necessary to meet the emergency
505313 the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america
505314 far from recognizing such an expansive meaning of executive power the founders took the phrase to refer to the mere execution of the laws and nowhere suggested that it meant anything else much less did they contend that it conferred a bundle of unspecified powers on the president there is also the little problem that article ii lists specific powers that the constitution confers on the president

505369 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
505370 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
505371 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

505393 breastfeeding protects maternal mood by lowering stress when stress levels are lower the mothers inflammatory response system will not be activated thereby lowering her risk of depression
505394 however positive these results i must issue one caveat they only apply when breastfeeding is going well as noted earlier when breastfeeding that is not going well particularly if there is pain it becomes a trigger to depression rather than something that lessens the risk mothers mental health is yet another reason to intervene quickly when breastfeeding difficulties arise
505395 mothers moods become more positive during breastfeeding and less positive during bottle feeding the effect is not permanent but it may explain why breastfeeding mothers become so devoted to the act of breastfeeding ref health psychol 2002 mar 21 2 187 93

505441 visst r det konstigt trots kunskap om att det f rekommer verv ld fr n ordningsvakter tar polisen f r givet att i valet mellan tre nerslagna m nniskor och sju utan en skr ma r det de slagna offren som r de skyldiga

505482 plus its always hard to see here for some reason
505483 i didnt want to get that close to the strike zone with that slider and i left it right down the middle
505484 and that pretty much sums up my location the whole day when the ball was up they got hits when i made my pitches i got ground balls it was just me kind of out of sync and not making my pitch but it happens im still confident going into the next one
505485 that early wed like to keep the lineup in our favor

505495 if youre just having hens there really isnt a problem as long as you take care of them just like any other pet
505496 maybe on a farm im in favor of it but id rather not have them in my neighborhood
505497 if you dont want to have chickens we dont care but wed really like to have the same right as other citizens in the state to have them if you want them
505498 he has helped on the distance and i think 50 percent of what i have done is because of the caddie

505501 but ive got to go out there tomorrow and play golf and i dont think greg norman is going to help me around so i have to do it on my own
505502 of course i would love to be closer if not in the lead
505503 but this is my position there is nothing i can do about it i have nothing to lose i hope to get a good start tomorrow and we will see
505504 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
505505 today was a little better more regular golf i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
505506 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow

505515 one definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result
505516 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life
505517 faith then is not just the grim determination to cling to a certain form of words no matter what may happen though we must certainly be prepared to defend our creed with our life but above all faith is the opening of the inward eye the eye of the heart to be filled with the presence f the divine light
505518 but i digress what i mean to note here is these obsessions with certainty are fundamentally ontologically incompatible with meaningful faith

505527 im very excited about the start of fall camp its an exciting and very challenging time to shape our 2008 season and who we become later on in life
505528 we know that the public at large is grieving the loss
505529 this is the first homicide now in several months since the roundup up of most of the gang leadership
505530 the men and women who have suffered service related injuries while serving our nation and their survivors deserve to be compensated at a rate that reflects the current cost of living
505531 there is no group of americans to whom we owe more than our nations veterans who were injured in service to their country one of my top priorities as ranking member is to ensure that they receive the assistance and care they have earned through their brave service
505532 youve got to be a boat knowing where youre going
505533 weve got money were famous but youve got to know what you want
505534 let me tell you something weve got so much bad stuff inside its up to us to make the best of it
505535 if we want to repeat were going to go and do it everything is possible in life hey whatever you want to be in life you could be
505536 im one of the best players in the league thats last year

505539 ive been ready since the end of last season lets go to japan today
505540 this week called for an end to the federal ban on offshore drilling the arizona senator wasnt flip flopping says senior campaign adviser
505541 just a month ago when mccain was asked about offshore drilling during a campaign stop in wisconsin the presumptive republican nominee noted that such resources would take years to develop and that the u s should
505542 so its not a change in his position as much as a new challenge to america black says
505543 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
505544 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
505545 we are saddened that our customers witnessed inappropriate behaviour and heard racist comments both from the guest author and some of the attendees at this particular event
505546 middle easterners include a wide variety of races religions and ethnicities including inter alia israeli jews christian arabs druze bahais egyptian coptic christians armenian and russian orthodox and many more
505547 this just proves that all arabs and muslims deserve to die
505548 at the time the iraqis wanted to get away from commercial systems to military grade communications we have seen much improved communications at the tactical level and we will no doubt see improvement in their tactical command and control capability
505549 for the first time ever really they had long range tactical secure communications to reach back to battalion and brigade headquarters they could do battle tracking and they knew where their units were at on the field
505550 they could communicate internally and externally in a range they had never been able to do before now they have that tactical command and control piece to keep that battlefield situational awareness of where their units are and what their status is
505551 there were lots of challenges weve had challenges in getting the training accomplished but the iraqi signal school and their combat colonel have really stepped up
505552 getting all that coordinated was challenging but it happened and now we have an excess of 1 000 operators that have been trained in the iraqi army
505553 i am very thankful and grateful for all efforts from the american teams and the american officers for their help for us to rebuild our army and our facilities
505554 the radio sets now are different than the radio sets we used in the past
505555 this radio is very useful in armored tanks and armored vehicle we can use base stations and man pack stations with our soldiers so its very important
505556 ive been here at taji for seven or eight months now involved in the training of the signal school soldiers and the basic trainees for them to have the equipment was one thing but after we went through that warfighter exercise that we were the observer controllers for and to see them be able to use those systems was pretty rewarding
505557 they have the capability to be a world class army and this is just one of those steps to give them those tools to allow those battlefield commanders to take control of their own sectors
505558 the sentinel provides the brigade with a picture of the local air area
505559 ive been boxing for a while now i know for a fact from practicing boxing in the past that its a great workout
505560 the goal here is not only to provide the soldiers a different way to work out and get in shape but also to instill discipline and self confidence because thats what boxing is all about
505561 just about everything you see came from our group we got together and came up with ideas from our different backgrounds we were able to put it all together and make the facility what it is today
505562 boxing causes you to think a lot you have to think about what youre going to do to defend yourself from an attack and what youre going to do as an offensive attack to your opponent
505563 you can definitely get in shape with this program that we have you are guaranteed to work every bit of your body with this you learn discipline and the basic skills of defense you will get a greater love of the sport
505564 people not in the brigade can still come and train they just cant get in the ring and do contact like sparring until we get a memorandum from their commander stating they are released to do that
505565 it was harder than i thought it was going to be all of a sudden i got scared and nervous all at the same time
505566 i started questioning my decision but after the first round i caught my breath and got a little more into it
505567 i didnt know much about boxing i still have a lot to learn im just learning the basics and getting it little by little every day
505568 some of the stuff i learn here i will definitely keep it with me i plan on working on my skills after i leave camp taji
505569 it was harder than i thought it was going to be all of a sudden i got scared and nervous all at the same time
505570 i started questioning my decision but after the first round i caught my breath and got a little more into it

505574 the school looks very good it is like a new house for the students
505575 now that we have a new looking school it will allow the students to work harder and better
505576 this is one of the first schools to be refurbished in this area
505577 we hope to work our way through all the schools we also realize a school can never be fixed once it is used daily during the school year
505578 this school refurbishment is a testament to the level of care for the neighborhood
505579 my soldiers have taken the time to ensure work is done correctly and according to the scheduled scope of work
505580 with the help of both coalition forces and the district council this place has become a school again
505581 on behalf of our neighborhood principal and teachers we give a special thanks for giving us the security to make it happen
505582 we have to give more attention to essential services and take the weapons and fighting away from here
505583 es gebe allerdings auch pilsformen die von au en nicht erkennbar und dementsprechend auch schwer diagnostizierbar seien
505584 company released its diamond phone in asia in june and will begin selling the handset through sprint nextel corp in august
505585 i answered two of them and got lots of missed calls but i told them they could do what they like it didnt stop me taking the case

505595 i dont know sir im only here to wash your upper body and feet

505597 today is saturday you may come by on monday to pick it up after your check has cleared
505598 how dare you show your face in here there wasnt a single penny in your checking account
505599 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homo phobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
505600 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean
505601 i know i talk with god and god replies people prefer to speak about the force of circumstances rather than miracles but i think miracles happen to everyone all the time
505602 i have to do two things forget and find spiritual peace and be able to forgive when i do this ill also have to recall my memories but perhaps in time these wont be so painful
505603 if i had not had the lord at my side i dont think i could have overcome this suffering
505604 being a hostage places you in a situation of constant humiliation you are a victim of total arbitrariness and you get to know whats most vile in the human spirit
505605 faced by this there are two paths you either let yourself grow ugly bitter peevish and vindictive and let your heart fill with spite or you choose the other path which jesus showed us when he asked us to bless our enemies
505606 is that an ample supply of energy is necessary to grow any business over the long term and the storage industry is shying away from the harsh reality that a sufficient amount of energy is unfortunately not available to keep the industry growing
505607 the story on digitimes is completely groundless we have no intention of getting out of the chipset business
505608 mercury research has reported that the nvidia market share of amd platforms in q208 was 60
505609 we have been steady in this range for over two years
505610 if your win move will make to gain also the adversary will have lost
505611 at amp t amp apple first announce in 2007 that this was a 5 year exclusive agreement
505612 some people say water on mars means intelligent life more likely
505613 he is coming the three fold man he dances in the lonely places oh creator of us all the doctor is coming
505614 i flew into the wild and fire i danced and died a thousand times
505615 death is coming oh i can see it everlasting death for the most faithful companion
505616 we welcome this new monitor because it is state of the art and it has only just been released in the united states so its a real time monitor that will add to the value of the five monitoring stations that we already have in place for heavy metals monitoring
505617 we have had a very extensive air quality monitoring station in place in mt isa for over 33 years and we are very proactive in that approach so we really do welcome this new monitoring station
505618 we are at breaking point there is no question of that
505619 we are locked down and we have had zero income since july 7 we have got a fairly complex business structure and so all your costs go on we really cant do anything until the quarantine is lifted
505620 we certainly will not survive if we dont get some form of help from the government
505621 we are past the point of being able to hang on now if we dont get some sort of assistance we will probably have to close
505622 it is certainly at a critical stage but we have been in discussions with the government for the last week and they are doing all that they possibly can
505623 it would be very damaging for the attractiveness for the tourism for jobs in alice springs
505624 the labor party and the clp should both tell voters that they are not going to entertain uranium 21 kilometres south of alice springs under any circumstances
505625 theres a lot of concern about the setting up of the new local government arrangements which include communities which have very very different cultural needs and i picked up on these in the territory
505626 ive been told about these issues by people but they dont seem to be making it onto the agenda
505627 and to a degree aided by the territory administration which has left indigenous people without consultation and in many cases feeling their good work in running excellent community or community ventures has been completely sidelined
505628 were seeing increasing numbers of people going onto the bus network the last few months
505629 it helps the community but it also helps the drunk by dealing with their alcoholism
505630 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
505631 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
505632 while i was pedalling in the clasica san sebastian i continued to have the breathing difficulties and headaches that have accompanied me in training since the fall on the tour
505633 company released its diamond phone in asia in june and will begin selling the handset through sprint nextel corp in august
505634 the story on digitimes is completely groundless we have no intention of getting out of the chipset business

505636 we have been steady in this range for over two years
505637 the cameras and the microphones were off but that didnt stop a small group of republicans from taking over the floor after the
505638 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black
505639 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government
505640 theres progress being made i wouldnt say as much as id like at this point so were going to continue to push him
505641 i think pushing him back into two a days will help him as well
505642 hey remember that one shot celtic had by massimo donati yesterday yeah me too
505643 matt this sounds an awfully lot like the mighty ducks series of movies
505644 well gollie gee paw i saw them coming and thought theyd shoot it right at me whoda thunk theyd go to the bottom corner again
505645 all right boys good game yesterday the defense played well and the midfield and strikers really passed well and finished confidently however i think our set pieces need a little work you know what to do boys jumping jacks for an hour
505646 we have the tools and expertise to submit up to 480 stumbles with reviews and featured tag pages and up to 80 user names in 50 high pr social bookmarking sites
505647 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art
505648 deus n o vai saber disso o alt ssimo n o descobrir nada
505649 o atl ntico pequeno pra nos separar porque o sangue mais forte que a gua do mar
505650 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
505651 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
505652 the most unhealthy thing would be to allow the debate to continue for a long time
505653 we would have only ourselves to blame if more of the provinces go their own way
505654 the vast majority want to take steps towards restoring communion but a smaller group base the language of communion on feelings what it means to me what can i get from it
505655 a major question is how we move towards that point the highest degree of fellowship whilst allowing for an orderly separation
505656 the traditionalists are in the minority and an increasing number in the church of england would side with the american church now
505657 the people in the pew wonder what all the fuss is about
505658 my greatest worry about the covenant is wholl still be around to use it
505659 if david gives a speech like that hes really going for it all bets will be off
505660 what david has done this week has put down a marker but its more than that
505661 he has shown that hes up for it this time round he was close to challenging gordon last year on mr blairs departure but to be frank he bottled it he wont do so this time
505662 they told us barefaced lies about how they were going to handle the story and that wont be forgotten
505663 david has no real base in the party hes rubbing people up the wrong way with his arrogance
505664 this was a deliberately aggressive act made at a time when people were away on holiday lots of my colleagues think he has harmed his chances of succeeding
505665 terrorism continues to raise its ugly head in our region it remains the single biggest threat to our stability we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric
505666 terrorists and extremists know no borders the recent attack on the indian embassy in kabul and the serial blasts in bangalore and ahmedabad are gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place here in south asia
505667 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto
505668 we are going to ask for tests to be done to determine his sanity and psychological profile
505669 when the crime was committed he had been high on cocaine and crack for four days and he was using when she arrived at his flat on saturday
505670 he just lost it he cant remember anything he hadnt slept for four days he was out of it
505671 hes crying a lot and already told me that hes deeply ashamed and very sorry and that he wants to talk to the girls mother and apologise
505672 he knows hell be locked up for a long time
505673 theres an emotional backdrop to this and that weighs heavily in this story
505674 he never accepted the death of his father like that
505675 he should have presented himself to police but he hasnt and that is because he has something to hide
505676 to the naked eye you could hardly see any blood just tiny drops
505677 this victory is bigger than just us so therefore i would have to say that it is my best
505678 ive got some really meaningful innings in my life like the double hundreds here at this ground and at lords in 2003 they have got to go down as some of my greatest achievements
505679 but so many south africa teams have come here since readmission and strived for victories so there are so many people back home who id like to have shared this with tonight
505680 we got off to such a good start at 65 for none and i thought a couple of more partnerships and we are there and all of a sudden after a couple of good deliveries and some sightscreen issues we were 93 for four
505681 this is a tragic incident but it is believed to be an isolated case which local police are treating as a robbery that went wrong
505682 i guess ill analyse and assess my game after the us open
505683 for the moment its just all a blur there are so many big tournaments all in a row and its hard now there is also the tough trip to china ahead of us before coming all the way back to new york for the us open
505684 to go two breaks down a set and two breaks down would have been tough to come back from
505685 it happens sometimes in tennis when youre feeling confident and you know your opponent hasnt played as well as he can throughout the year
505686 physically once i started to warm up i felt fine and thought i was moving really well at the end of the match i just didnt get going early on im not sure what happened and ill try to make sure it doesnt happen again
505687 hes tough wherever you play him it doesnt matter hes sometimes had some better results on the slightly slower courts
505688 he played really well against federer and has been a lot more solid off the ground if he serves well its so hard to break him and ill have to return great if i want to come through that match
505689 revenge killer when he feels that he has been slighted he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
505690 the government was very keen to see this happen and the directors were prepared to recommend the deal but the shareholders have every right to their opinion on the value of the company
505691 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful
505692 the pals in their late 20s necked strong cider in a pub before racing off along a country lane in three 210mph lambo murcielagos and a 137 000 worth about rm1 5mil bentley continental but one lost control 600 yards from the boozer and smashed into a tree
505693 i was sitting having a beer and you could hear the noise of the engines coming down the road they pulled into the car park and were showing off revving and red lining their engines
505694 they were in the bar downing pints of cider and bragging about how they had been racing and one of them had got the car up to 160mph
505695 they were all in ties and suits like they had been to a wedding reception
505696 i left on my bike and they came screaming past then three of the cars flew back obviously because the road was blocked by the crashed lambo they were driving extremely fast and dangerously
505697 then i came across the car lying in the middle of the road there were people standing round it taking bits off and sitting in it
505698 it was a total wreck all smashed up down one side
505699 with a previous arizona gathering of 9 challenge stradales in one location the socal owners set out to best it
505700 people have started coming forward and identifying themselves as muslims
505701 and employers are realizing that if their employees are happy they work better
505702 today you even have leadership and management training workshops associated with muslims
505703 they are trying to climb the corporation into management whereas in the 1990s they were just happy to have a stable job
505704 as americans started losing confidence they stopped fearing their muslim neighbor

505715 holbrooke prometeu formalmente que karadzic n o seria levado ao tribunal de haia se abandonasse definitivamente a vida p blica
505716 na noite de 18 para 19 de julho de 1996
505717 mas sei que holbrooke admitiu que garantias verbais foram dadas a karadzic nas mais altas esferas do poder
505718 em novembro de 2000 no momento das elei es gerais na b snia a cia ficou sabendo que karadzic seguia dirigindo o sds partido nacionalista s rvio fundado por ele no in cio dos anos 90 apesar do acordo estipulando que n o poderia se envolver com atividades pol ticas
505719 em 2000 houve uma reuni o do sds na localidade de bijeljina leste da b snia dirigida pessoalmente por karadzic ele dava instru es aos militantes e designava os membros da dire o que deviam ser substitu dos al m das pessoas que deveriam ser nomeadas
505720 karadzic esteve pessoalmente envolvido em todas as atividades do sds os americanos ficaram furiosos quando perceberam e decidiram ent o suspender a prote o informal
505721 nobody wants to go on the dl no matter what it is
505722 there is always a letdown when you cant be out there but i think its best in the end to get this thing worked out and taken care of
505723 im a big believer in once a guy gets to the big leagues i dont want him to sit around and think about it
505724 i want him to get out there and play as quickly as possible
505725 were going to watch it right now its day to day
505726 eu voltaria a fazer todas e cada uma das coisas que fiz
505727 on all the evidence that i have seen the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
505728 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately
505729 however we are making sure were keeping a very close watch on qantas
505730 were doing extra surveillance so that we make sure safety standards are being maintained
505731 obviously the investigation now will look at why exactly the leak from the hydraulic system occurred and whether theres any risk of that happening in other aircraft
505732 the civil aviation safety authority will be getting detailed engineering reports on that
505733 we dont have anything thats logical and connected and to tackle obesity you need to be able to go somewhere which has all the modern treatments and that includes bariatric surgery
505734 my brother and i get into an argument with a taxi driver about getting our change back he got on his mobile phone and all of a sudden at least 15 greeks with baseball bats batons and chains appeared out of nowhere
505735 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
505736 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
505737 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
505738 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye
505739 have you seen the new commercial the mccain campaign compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton and today the obama campaign released an ad comparing john mccain to warner todd huston
505740 it would be very damaging for the attractiveness for the tourism for jobs in alice springs
505741 the labor party and the clp should both tell voters that they are not going to entertain uranium 21 kilometres south of alice springs under any circumstances
505742 theres a lot of concern about the setting up of the new local government arrangements which include communities which have very very different cultural needs and i picked up on these in the territory

505745 were seeing increasing numbers of people going onto the bus network the last few months
505746 it helps the community but it also helps the drunk by dealing with their alcoholism
505747 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
505748 abrir espa os de participa o para as pessoas e informar adequadamente
505749 temos uma conjuntura cultural bastante machista h muitos temas que s o tabu que n o s o propostos abertamente como a sexualidade
505750 os homens devem levantar a voz a favor dos temas propostos pela coaliz o
505751 a feminiza o est acontecendo e um dos principais obst culos para reduzi la o estigma e a discrimina o
505752 nesse referendo revogat rio o que est em debate n o evo morales n o se enganem evo morales passageiro est o em debate programas de governo dois modelos econ micos
505753 mais simples nacionaliza o ou privatiza o dos recursos naturais
505754 com o referendo queremos que seja aprofundada e acelerada a nacionaliza o e recupera o de todos os recursos naturais porque h grupos que querem a volta dos privatizadores esse o tema central e n o h motivo de engano
505755 the chances of us getting him back sept 1 are zero
505756 as long as we felt he was healthy strong and ready to go i would not have any hesitation
505757 it will be like spring training again and you dont have concerns when hes your opening day starter six weeks after doing his work we have to make sure hes healthy
505758 i think wg improved alot in the last few weeks but we are in good shape and if we play our topgame were gonna take it all
505759 were hopeful that its going to elicit a lot of leads

505762 wir best tigen den wechsel es ist eine sehr interessante herausforderung f r alparslan erdem man hat ihm bei galatasaray eine gute rolle in der mannschaft in aussicht gestellt nichtsdestotrotz ist sein abgang sehr schade weil er auch bei uns f r den erweiterten kreis vorgesehen war und eine perspektive vorhanden gewesen w re
505763 fakt ist auch dass bei uns auf der position hinten links ein gro er konkurrenzkampf herrscht und dar ber hinaus viele junge leute nachkommen von galatasaray gab es f r alle seiten ein reizvolles angebot dass sich f r uns finanziell sehr lukrativ gestaltete
505764 schlie lich habe ich hier eine sch ne zeit gehabt und mich sehr wohl gef hlt doch ich sehe bei galatasaray die bessere sportliche perspektive
505765 ein gro teil meiner familie lebt in istanbul so dass ich mich schnell zu hause f hlen werde
505766 wir h tten mit alparslan gerne weiter zusammengearbeitet und auch seinen vertrag verl ngert aber er hat den wunsch ge u ert zu wechseln diesem wunsch sind wir nachgekommen
505767 dieser wechsel zeigt erneut dass unsere ausgebildeten spieler immer auch interessant f r andere vereine sind
505768 das ist f r uns sowohl sportlich als auch menschlich ein gro er verlust aber ich kann verstehen dass galatasaray f r ihn eine gro e chance ist
505769 it would be ridiculous to see a forum thread titled latest steam update terrorists too strong
505770 undead can not only dance but they sing at the same time and might even have written the song in the first place
505771 native american had a hard time than blacks dont you think well at least you got to travel
505772 vilifying one group of people yet granting special rights to another group based on skin colour is called racism
505773 if he had been playing night elf instead i would probably have ended up an sk fan because of zacard or something similar
505774 the lack of prospects with this team and different opinions about the future of the established brand wicked
505775 after a couple of months without a clan we are very proud to join the famous wicked esports
505776 with some new players and the great support of wicked we really look forward to the upcoming seasons in the ngl wpl whl and premier league we hope for a great future and we will do our best to show some good results
505777 you got now a roster of eight players do you think there will be any problems within the team because of that big roster drayich a shepherd can have up to 60 sheeps if he has a good dog i think i can handle eight guys with a decent cat
505778 i want to win everything in 2nd half of 2008
505779 i do not think my micro is that good for example not making the best of what i have in big fights
505780 my goal is to come back to my peak and win everything in the second half of the year
505781 age of conan released with some initial success a couple of months ago and we did see some of our players leave to try the game
505782 however weve seen about 40 percent of those players return to world of warcraft
505783 this additional counter strike team will now earn 4kings a foothold in the 1 6 scene which we havent had for a while now through our focus on the uk market
505784 whilst well continue to work with the homegrown scene by keeping our uk team the guys from finland are a welcomed addition to the organisation
505785 this team aka kuppi amp spikeone under cmax gg name
505786 it doesnt matter if youre called logitech cmax excello or 4kings it doesnt even matter whose in the team the only thing that matter is youre not roccat i e the number one team in finland which means no wcg kode5 eswc and the likes
505787 thats like saying to sk because youre not in fnatic no wcg kode5 or any other tournaments
505788 the second tier team in finland barely gets to go to any international events thats fact check any of the previous names i mentioned and youll see they hardly played outside of finland
505789 this additional counter strike team will now earn 4kings a foothold in the 1 6 scene which we havent had for a while now through our focus on the uk market
505790 whilst well continue to work with the homegrown scene by keeping our uk team the guys from finland are a welcomed addition to the organisation
505791 you cannot do a 50 game which is that pure
505792 big budget media rich titles are not coming back on the pc
505793 keyboard and mouse are still the best way to play an fps game
505794 sk gaming asked whether they could try to build a game from the multiplayer up the same way starcraft 2 is being built and carmack said that they tried it with enemy territory and it did not work out for them
505795 our match today vs mtw could go either way the 2on2 will decide it
505796 ass fatta senast jag var p m llan blev jag s j vla bl st 300 sp nn f r 5 gram basilika s j vla pinsamt
505797 personally i was a lot more relaxed we didnt arrive at orlando with any pressure from sponsors to win it i choked up on our first match in sd against got game west and rhaegyn choked on a rogue versus frag dominant duelists both teams are amazing so we werent going to win without giving it our best
505798 our team is excited to be joining fnatic and will strive to live up to their top tier reputation i expect our team to play at our highest level as we did at mlg orlando and will push to do so at each and every event that we attend
505799 if you are so inept that you walk off edges then the system will put you against other inept players
505800 see youre setting me up to get in trouble right here
505801 senator mccain i would have him serve in the role of loyal opposition in the minority
505802 theres an important function to be served there i mean its important to have an opposition that is keeping you on your toes and giving you a hard time and calling you out if youre not doing what you say your gonna to do thats part of what is good about democracy
505803 the virgin islands board of nurse licensure is severely understaffed and employees are underpaid for their years of dedicated service and hard work
505804 you feel that because you gave up your retirement you should get a 15 000 raise
505805 it goes to say you got some nerves i dont think thats a strong justification
505806 we will see if it is the will of this body to give those salaries in that amount
505807 it is a means of mitigating the problems of the future
505808 as far as im concerned manny can stay in my guest house
505809 he can run hit hit for power play defense hes not the accomplished hitter manny is but he can do a lot of things manny doesnt bring to the table
505810 we believe basically were going to have made an acquisition by the way our guys are going to perform over the last two months
505811 they have track records that suggest such and we believe theres a lot more to come
505812 at this point in particular sen nelson we are looking forward to doing much in 2009 and we know we have the funding
505813 theres so much that can happen with agriculture with so little resources
505814 a full fair and comprehensive review of all the issues and concerns raised
505815 work every day and every night in service to us all
505816 let us all remember this was not an audit of our nurses or aides or doctors or technicians working at our hospital and cancer center and clinic
505817 an alarming depth of mismanagement of medical center funds and a complete lack of oversight of these monies
505818 the findings of this audit established that the actions and inactions of those charged with the oversight of the executives that they placed to run the medical center failed to meet the standard we must insist upon as a community
505819 additionally the actions and inactions of those executives have been described in the audit in ways which require a fuller investigation in order to take appropriate actions
505820 contributed to the current management and financial crisis by failing to live up to their fiduciary responsibilities
505821 what we have here is a crisis of leadership not a crisis of care
505822 disruption of services or lessening of the quality of care
505823 the dedicated and extraordinary care givers at these medical institutions know what they are doing and they perform their jobs very well
505824 but what they and indeed everyone in this community deserve and what i demand is that our hospitals and clinics must be free from corruption and waste free from scandal and that the executives of these facilities are also free from suspicion of such
505825 i wonder how many people i can catch going 5mph over the speed limit today
505826 to determine whether in fact there was any collusion or bad faith involved
505827 manage operate superintend control and maintain the hospitals and health facilities of the government of the virgin islands in partnership with the government
505828 employ and remove through the district governing boards the chief executive officers
505829 as long as a significant portion of the health facilities budget is appropriated from public revenues the government must be represented in any health care management structure
505830 youre pretty i like to look at you it must be love
505831 you smell good id like to eat you it must be love
505832 he who walks with wise men will be wise but the companion of fools will be destroyed
505833 make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man do not go lest you learn his ways and set a snare for your soul
505834 do not be deceived evil company corrupts good habits awake to righteousness and do not sin for some do not have the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame
505835 if anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which accords with godliness he is proud knowing nothing from such withdraw yourself
505836 do not enter the path of the wicked and do not walk in the way of evil avoid it do not travel on it turn away from it and pass on
505837 our god is in heaven he does whatever he pleases their idols are silver and gold the work of mens hands they have mouths but they do not speak eyes they have but they do not see they have ears but they do not hear those who make them are like them so is everyone who trusts in them
505838 the thoughts of the righteous are right but the counsels of the wicked are deceitful
505839 a prudent man conceals knowledge but the heart of fools proclaims foolishness
505840 the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he who heeds counsel is wise
505841 whoever loves instruction loves knowledge but he who hates correction is stupid
505842 a man shall eat well by the fruit of his mouth but the soul of the unfaithful feeds on violence
505843 forsake foolishness and live and go in the way of understanding
505844 put away from you a deceitful mouth and put perverse lips far from you let your eyes look straight ahead and your eyelids look right before you ponder the path of your feet and let all your ways be established do not turn to the right or the left remove your foot from evil

505849 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
505850 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
505851 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
505852 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
505853 ill admit mgs has not had success in the mmo space and that happened under my leadership so i take full responsibility its a tough and challenging space thats evolving all the time a lot of shifting sands
505854 im sure we can solve that problem though in a way that is good for mmo developers and customers because we want that content and were getting very close but were late with that and we feel bad about that

505953 people have started coming forward and identifying themselves as muslims
505954 and employers are realizing that if their employees are happy they work better
505955 much more open about their religion and make it part of their overall life
505956 today you even have leadership and management training workshops associated with muslims
505957 they are trying to climb the corporation into management whereas in the 1990s they were just happy to have a stable job
505958 as americans started losing confidence they stopped fearing their muslim neighbor
505959 the prayer rooms arent mandatory but they are fringe benefits

505995 the fruitfly community is not necessarily anarchic but they do have wild ideas about gene names
505996 it struck me that if i were talking to a patient and telling them the problem is that they have a mutation in their lunatic fringe that would be an inappropriate conversation we were having
505997 for us and other people who have gone through the stress of infertility we are simply grateful to have a baby at all the thought of being able to choose a particular sex eye colour etc doesnt even come into the equation for us it was a way of determining earlier those embryos that would result in miscarriage and those that would hopefully result in an ongoing pregnancy

506006 the average salesperson is too focused on his or her product or service
506007 but if you can change the conversation to more relevant issues like how to help that customer increase revenue or decrease time to market that will make a huge impression
506008 if salespeople arent asking good questions that show insight and depth of knowledge on broader industry issues they most likely wont grow business in those accounts

506019 some of the biggest men in the united states in the field of commerce and manufacture are afraid of something they know that there is a power somewhere so organized so subtle so watchful so interlocked so complete so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it
506020 ideas are more powerful than guns we would not let our enemies have guns why should we let them have ideas
506021 when a well packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic
506022 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act

506025 your ability to articulate what youre looking for in the new position and how it differs from your current or previous role can be a key indicator in your likelihood to stick around for the new opportunity
506026 in an interview your response should be genuine yet you do not want to appear frustrated desperate negative or bad mouth your current employer boss or co workers
506027 let me be clear in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
506028 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

506030 how do we leverage our technology systems to be more effective
506031 for example 50 servers have been accumulated over the years without sufficient thought to cost or efficiency the sa will look at the options perhaps leveraging existing systems in a more efficient way or replacing all 50 servers with one high density blade server
506032 innovation in todays world is in backend systems speed and capability systems need to work every time and faster than the last time

506056 as the iraqi security forces get stronger and get better then we will be able to continue drawing down our troops in the future
506057 and i think that this transition of control and of responsibility primary responsibility for security is a process thats already well under way and based on everything that im hearing will be able to continue
506058 there hasnt really been any discussion of numbers and its definitely based on conditions on the ground
506059 are a lot more favorable than in december or april or even two months ago
506060 we have clearly seen an increase in violence in afghanistan
506061 at the same time weve seen a reduction in violence and casualties in iraq and i think its just part of our commitment to ensure that we have the resources available to be successful in afghanistan over the long haul
506062 we will continue discussions with the iraqis on our shared goals of a reduced u s troop presence
506063 there were no locks on the doors and you could pretty much wander the building without a lot of interference
506064 toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety
506065 there was a requirement to register the laboratory not the individual
506066 thats when locks went on doors and armed guards and the whole nine yards
506067 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions and plans
506068 i dont believe that reviewing a persons medical record is part of a typical security investigation unless there is an indication that theres a concern there
506069 and the alternative here is to have a much higher level of scrutiny for everybody in the system i dont particularly want investigators going through my medical records if theres not a reason a security related reason to do that

506083 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement

506109 hes been here for my child without mr woods it will be nothing
506110 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
506111 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
506112 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
506113 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
506114 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
506115 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
506116 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
506117 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
506118 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
506119 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
506120 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
506121 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence

506125 i knew him from television watching him when i was in college and seeing the redskins winning big in 1982 so i had seen him by way of television and when i got a chance to play against him i was obviously in awe i think that the competition with him is what helped me become what i am
506126 i think that i would just say that with the guys that are in the hall of hame and i played against a lot of them he is every bit as good as they are his speed his hands his route running his competitiveness i mean goodness he had the record for catches at one point and he had the record for most catches in a single season
506127 only two guys i can remember that were quiet like that on the field and would never give me the time of day because i would try and have a conversation when i was playing i would talk to the guy and find out where he was at mentally but art monk and jerry rice never ever bothered they were always professionals always worried about the game and didnt even give me the time of day
506128 it wasnt as easy as i thought it would be
506129 it was a bad experience but it was the greatest experience i ever could have had it kind of changed my whole paradigm and thinking about what i needed to do to be successful at it
506130 he had a certain way of running routes later in his career
506131 what makes this even more significant than just being in the hall of fame is that were going in together he wasnt just a teammate of mine hes a great friend our families are like real family his kids call me uncle my kids called him uncle we do those things together this makes it just that much more of a special event for us
506132 he used his speed to be able to see the quarterback through the receiver so that gave him an advantage because if the pressure was getting there fast and the quarterback was going to have to throw early he could see that ball and break on it but the one downfall of that was if you are facing a big receiver like mike quick or michael irvin they are going to play basketball on you shield you so you cant get the inside ball and they can catch the ball and that is one of the things i learned from watching darrell
506133 i actually played for my elementary school instead of playing with the guys my age i played with the guys my size
506134 in the eighth grade i came up with a plan
506135 i think it goes back to my dad who said boy you can really play that ball and that was encouraging
506136 so his voice eventually prevailed but really early on i was you know i cant say anything benefited me i was struggling trying to just stand up out there and face the guys on a day to day basis i was a little fella and i was scared
506137 every time we won the film department would stay up all night and not only get all the film cutups but they would put together a highlight reel of the game and set it to music it would be a three or four minute highlight reel and they would show it in our meeting on monday
506138 we were playing the phoenix cardinals and green we used to call him peewee or peanut head intercepts the ball and we rewound the video highlight film because it was one of those situations where he intercepted the football and it reminded me of the old disney movie

506140 if they keep running my way im going to get me a contract somebodys going to get me a contract
506141 i never wanted it to get to this point because i didnt want it to affect my game thats the hardest part im having now going out to practice and going 100 per cent and not worrying about an injury
506142 im looking on the sideline and seeing my son and knowing it can all change in one play
506143 i was way down one of those maybes then they put the tape on of kearse and it was like who is that guy ive always had to prove myself a little more
506144 its the only time hes ever looked me right in the eye and lied to me
506145 usually i can read him but he fooled me on that one i found out later it was a boldface lie
506146 what they offered me was a slap in my face
506147 the average person away from game they dont understand that they look at it as mike peterson is trying to be greedy hes making millions why does he want more millions its not all about the money
506148 i love the game first next i want to get paid for it because this is my job if i was playing the game and had another job it would be different i dont want no more than im worth

506178 a testament to the quality of the debut record and the amount of time amp inspiration that went into writing it
506179 what im guessing that means is that you think it sounds more like everything else on the radio and heaven forfend that the liz phair you knew when she was gigging at the double door actually change her sound to something that you might hear on the radio

506182 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
506183 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
506184 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personal
506185 we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
506186 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations
506187 so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
506188 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man
506189 he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pick up trucks
506190 i was personally responsible for transporting and getting out all families from afghanistan to pakistan
506191 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
506192 he was not with the ideology of osama bin laden and people like him he was only searching for pleasure and money in this life
506193 he is intending to invoke self incrimination rights and not appear
506194 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
506195 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
506196 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
506197 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with the anthrax investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
506198 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
506199 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
506200 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
506201 we anticipate being able to provide additional details in the near future
506202 what i can tell you is that president bush over the years has maintained an interest in this case and has periodically been updated by the fbi director
506203 the public the victims families and law enforcement would like to know that the book is closed on this investigation
506204 the fbi has not briefed me about todays news reports so i cannot say whether that is the case
506205 what we learn will not change the fact that this has been a poorly handled investigation that has lasted six years and already has resulted in a trail of embarrassment and personal tragedy
506206 its been frustrating that the fbi has essentially shut out congress throughout its seven year investigation
506207 now seems to be the opportune time for the bureau to brief congress about whether the case is to be closed and justice will be served
506208 if it is we must thoroughly examine the reasons why in the meantime we should remember that a rush to judgment can be dangerous and expensive for everyone the last person the fbi had in its sights in this case suffered for six years and just collected a 6 million settlement
506209 i would like to be able to assure the public that this has been thoroughly investigated and reviewed

506237 like the rest of canada it embraces freedom democracy human rights and the rule of law

506319 so parents and teachers need to revise their thoughts about this
506320 stereotypes are very very resistant to change but as a scientist i have to challenge them with data
506321 suggested one such possible reason could be mens higher variance in relevant innate abilities or innate preference
506322 this study wont end the debate though because as professor hyde points out even the hardest questions on this test are still not complex enough to stretch the most talented students and really uncover whether a gender difference exists at the extreme end of the distribution other studies continue to find that at the more gifted end boys outperform girls in maths
506323 i think all things must be taken into consideration hrvoje and there is such a thing as subtle digs at women and african americans which are in my opinion worthy of termination
506324 thats something the players came up with they put one of those on my desk i think its more of a commitment to team and a goal one thing that we had mentioned as a unit is that we dont talk enough around here about winning a championship the players felt like they needed to talk more about winning a championship
506325 we really feel like we have two solid centers and three guards and three tackles and we have several young players on the offensive line that we think are going to be good players
506326 for us i wouldnt trade robinson for anybody there are some really good quarterbacks in this league and i think the coaches and the offensive coordinators have done a good job getting players that really adapt to their style of play theyre different but you always feel like if you play a team with a good quarterback you have to play very well because they always have a chance to win for what we do on offense we think zac is great and were glad to have him
506327 it was great learning behind victor degrate he really helped me develop as a player i think he showed me off the field just how to carry yourself when you learn how to carry yourself off the field it will be make you that much better on the field go about everything 100 percent and win or lose you did your best thats all you can ask for
506328 its new hes a different style from our last coach but hes a really good guy were still getting to know him and its been a lot of fun learning from him our last coach was a little more laid back coach spencer is very to the point
506329 ive always gotten nervous even back in high school going out there and starting has always been a big thing to me i started a few games last year so i know what its like i got to start against and that was a big step for me its nothing i havent seen before i will just get to do it more times than i did last year
506330 i like getting to blitz more getting to be close to the line of scrimmage feeling more like a run stopper i feel like it plays more into my strong suits
506331 i definitely think it is more comfortable for the defense entering this season because everybody has adjusted to coach beckman more hes also adjusted his schemes to fit our personalities better everybodys comfortable out there and everybodys having fun and when everybodys having fun it makes it a lot easier to go out there and practice hard
506332 the coaches the atmosphere i really liked coach gundy when he came in he really wanted to get after it the opportunity to play
506333 weve got a nice group of young freshmen that came in richetti jones will get a chance to step up guys work so hard in the weight room and get so strong and fast they cant do anything but help us and make us better were going to have more depth i think thats what we lacked last year and the couple of years ive been here were right there with the top teams like ou and texas a amp m we just need depth later in the game so we can learn to finish and use it more i think theyre going to help us out a lot this year
506334 the defense made a big stride in the spring a very big stride i feel that when the season starts the offense and the defense will be clicking on all cylinders weve been working hard and we feel that we can be a very productive defense just like our offense
506335 what you saw in the spring well show you in the fall we have been working hard and we really want to focus on the task at hand and play hard
506336 it gives you something to really look forward to when you wake up or youre just walking down the street and you look down at your wrist and see that wristband december 6 big 12 championship thats where we want to be and thats where were striving to be at so it plays a big key in what were doing its more than just being on the field its mental
506337 were shooting for a top 25 defense thats our goal with the way were coming out in practice with the way were working hard its very achievable
506338 it was okay at times i struggled just with my learning curve and having to go from offense to defense that was the hardest thing just changing my whole mentality and not blocking everybody that i had to tackle
506339 the first thing ill say about those junior college players is that theyre all winners they all came from great programs and they all know what it takes to be a champion because theyve all played in championship games or played for a championship that was one thing we looked at with the junior college players because they know how to win theyve been taught how to win
506340 i still believe deep down in my heart and i know that defense wins championships so thats what we keep on harping on we learn to take care of our own business and everything will take care of itself im big on family and were going to treat each other as family as a brother theyve done a good job with that and ive seen them really buying in to what were asking them to do
506341 wonder where it went to he said resting his eyes from reading she sat down on the bed
506342 presented blameless and holy in his sight without blemish and free from accusation col 1 22
506343 he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight eph
506344 all of my heart all of my mind all of my soul and all of my strength
506345 wow i didnt think i was t hat good this year
506346 so we make it our goal to please him whether we are at home in the body or away from it
506347 god can love me even me no matter what i had done
506348 i thank christ jesus our lord for he has given me strength that he considered me faithful appointing me to his service
506349 the new this or the other amplified international contemporary translated word of god bible
506350 not given us a spirit of fear but one of power and love and of sound mind
506351 woe is me i am a man of unclean lips and i live among people of unclean lips
506352 to pray that i would proclaim this message clearly and that i would be wise in the way i acted toward outsiders that my conversation would be seasoned with salt and to make the most of every opportunity
506353 brothers i do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead i press on toward the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus
506354 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive in christ even when we were dead in our transgressions it is by grace that you have been saved
506355 now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is at work within us to him be the glory in the church and in christ jesus through
506356 i dont dwell in the past we just have to think of the past as a learning experience
506357 you just have to believe that your shots will go in thats why i made all those shots
506358 we promised each other in the team not to lose anymore
506359 they made a lot of progress overnight cleaning up the debris now they are getting to some of those extremely large boulders so there will some blasting involved to get them down to size
506360 theyre too large to move with the heavy equipment onsite so we may have to blast those but we are very confident we will have the highway open sunday we cant be more specific because of the blasting
506361 the whole cleanup has been a combination of a lot of resources throwing everything they have at it
506362 once the debris is removed we can start on that it will require some repaving definitely that in itself is not a huge obstacle
506363 staff are absolutely confident they would not have gone in to remove that debris if they hadnt been 100 per cent confident of the rock face
506364 that rock face along with other areas along the corridor will continue to be monitored now that a whole lot of that rock has been released it probably makes it a little bit more safer in a perfect world wed do it in a more controlled fashion but there was nothing to suggest that a slide of this magnitude was going to happen
506365 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
506366 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
506367 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
506368 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
506369 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
506370 there is a lot of suspension movement very low grip and a lot of power it just drives very differently and you cant drive them aggressively you have to drive very smoothly to go fast its very strange
506371 there were some drivers who had never seen the course it was more to tell us when to turn left and when to turn right
506372 its not a question of how to drive the track its the different rules for nascar they are different than open wheel racing so there is stuff i needed to know
506373 it will take a few laps to get used to the different driving style and braking zones but if the car performs as well as it did during testing last week everything should go well
506374 the race being in montreal its logical that some cars would have canadian drivers
506375 and they are mostly the cars where drivers drive mostly on ovals
506376 i knew it would be difficult but it was a harder job than expected
506377 i am sure that if i had tried to do that in 1998 after just winning the formula one championship it would have been a lot easier
506378 at the end of the day even though there is a lot of respect for what i achieved my oval experience was not huge ultimately its how good you will do over a 36 race season on mostly ovals
506379 im just trying to bring the sponsorship that the teams ask
506380 im not trying to get rich its really that is whats needed to race and thats all
506381 a good showing would help with the sponsors but wont help with the teams since this is a road course and what matters to them is the ovals
506382 everyone has been very helpful jimmy johnson jeff gordon and even juan pablo montoya
506383 we didnt get along in f1 but in nascar he is a very nice guy thats a nice thing about nascar everybody seems to help each other out to a certain extent obviously
506384 one of the most important and useful pro life conferences
506385 until it happens we have to assume that it cannot happen
506386 second of all mccain hasnt said he wouldnt sign foca if congress passes and presents it to him
506387 im going to vote for a third pary candidate in the general election
506388 true but i will accept the endorsement of the national right to life as a pretty good indication that he wont be signing that act
506389 no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws
506390 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
506391 anything can happen in the middle east between now and when olmert finally steps down
506392 it could be an agreement with syria but it is rather more likely to be an israeli attack on iran hezbollah hamas or all three
506393 mr mckinnon is charged with the biggest military computer hack of all time
506394 weve come so far from last year yates said saturday
506395 were trying to do new things tweak the offense a little bit trying to get the best play out there on the field and sometimes that might mean calling the play from the sideline checking off
506396 i was actually a little bit sorer yesterday than today the sophomore from georgia said
506397 what part of role playing exactly leads people into these hornets nests of insanity
506398 just enter a hot dog eating contest and pretend the hot dogs are people then follow it up with pie only the pie is buildings
506399 in my group every time a character dies his player has to be hit in the nuts with a cricket bat and anyone who doesnt do this is a weak minded carebear who should go back to knitting
506400 really one night der wuz a real bad storm an da dragon got struck by lightning right in da head we heard him thumping around outside da main tower
506401 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
506402 we discussed with the patient that he would have to deal with the fact that his hands were from somebody else
506403 but this was discussed before the first heart transplant and in reality nobody really cared about that
506404 it is going to be quite difficult to get any sensation the higher it is the harder it is
506405 flexing and bending the arm is also going to be hard
506406 he is going to require intensive physiotherapy every day for many months

506413 yes i did recently squeeze a tiny person out of my pelvis thank you for asking
506414 i tried to stick it on him and he ran such a great route
506415 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings
506416 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
506417 i knew we just needed one or two partnership i was focusing on 10 runs at a time thinking lets just get close
506418 i felt we were just one wicket away if we could have got the likes of morne morkel and paul harris in on that kind of deck i felt we could have won the game
506419 theyve played better cricket than us over the three games
506420 the fault of dawkins as an academic was his scandalous and apparently deliberate refusal to present the doctrine which he appears to think he has refuted in its strongest form
506421 an academic attacking some ideological position which he believes to be mistaken must of course attack that position in its strongest form this dawkins does not do in the case of einstein and his failure is the crucial index of his insincerity of academic purpose and therefore warrants me in charging him with having become what he has probably believed to be an impossibility a secularist bigot
506422 the whole enterprise of the god delusion was not as it at least pretended to be an attempt to discover and spread knowledge of the existence or non existence of god but rather an attempt an extremely successful one to spread the authors own convictions in this area
506423 antony flew having lost the ability to write a book was persuaded by a christian ghost writer roy varghese to let him write it instead it is one thing for a footballer or a supermodel to use a ghost writer but there is something absurd about a philosopher using a ghost writer
506424 flew has now apparently lost the ability to read a book too for his review of the god delusion turns out to be a review of its index and nothing but its index he only needed to read chapter 1 in order to see the absurdity of his claims about my treatment of einstein
506425 this victory is bigger than just us so therefore i would have to say that it is my best
506426 ive got some really meaningful innings in my life like the double hundreds here at this ground and at lords in 2003 they have got to go down as some of my greatest achievements
506427 but so many south africa teams have come here since readmission and strived for victories so there are so many people back home who id like to have shared this with tonight
506428 we got off to such a good start at 65 for none and i thought a couple of more partnerships and we are there and all of a sudden after a couple of good deliveries and some sightscreen issues we were 93 for four
506429 du denkst ich sei auf heroin bin ich aber nicht siehst du etwa irgendwo einstichl cher

506431 will we ever run free of those worldly wantings that send the unhungry out hunting
506432 jose was an outstanding leader in journalism he set standards in professional journalism which would be difficult for anybody to match
506433 all journalists should learn to work very hard like him we have learnt from him that with hard work dedication and commitment the sky is the limit for every conscientious journalist he said nan reports that jose did not have the opportunity of tertiary education as his educational exploits ended at the yaba methodist school and st saviours high school lagos what the legend of nigerian journalism missed in the colleges he made up for with his exceptional and intimidating success jose was honoured with the national award of the officer of the order of the federal republic in october 1965 he was decorated with the pope pius medal for promoting religious understanding in nigeria in 1973 jose was awarded the honorary doctor of letters by the university of benin in 1978 among his publications are towards mt arafat
506434 the departure of such a great man diminishes us all we can no longer benefit from his encyclopaedic grasp of the news process that he acquired within two decades of rising from an employment as a technical trainee in 1941 to become the managing director of africas most prosperous news organization in 1962 we can no longer invite him to those interesting sessions to relive his days and learn from his experience in walking the tight rope of business and politics within the organisation that he served so well all that is left are the writings he left behind and those that were written about him putting these writings in a single volume should be a worthy way to immortalise this epitome of patriotism in my reflections of the life and times of this great educator and mass communicator i have singled out three outstanding values that those of us who wish to follow his footsteps must imbibe these are the values of enterprise dedication to work and faith in the almighty
506435 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
506436 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
506437 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
506438 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
506439 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
506440 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
506441 and after the first project i ever did i enjoyed it so much i just kept doing it
506442 i was 15 years old and i drove it home
506443 my dad he told me that im going to be the operator of that tractor and ive operated it for 56 years i still farm with it
506444 billings is planning on defending 400 000 acre ft per year of water rights the city of great falls is embarrassed to defend an 1889 53 000 acre ft yr water right billings is defending a water right over seven times as large as great falls but its population is only twice as large
506445 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
506446 theres progress being made i wouldnt say as much as id like at this point so were going to continue to push him
506447 i think pushing him back into two a days will help him as well
506448 any team can look good on paper you cant really worry about that
506449 we like being the underdog when youre the underdog youve got something to prove
506450 were happy where were at were happy with our team
506451 for me i dont want anything less than a super bowl
506452 anything less than a super bowl is a bad year
506453 this customary law in our opinion doesnt really exist because the fifa regulations have been changed many times in recent years
506454 this campaign was always going to be closer than many people thought it would be
506455 poor obama seems to have thought it wouldnt be close at all
506456 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president or mr universe
506457 not like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
506458 if anyone thinks that picking a woman will simply placate hillary clintons supporters i think thats very patronising
506459 last year i got a couple preseason snaps but this year im feeling real good and eager to contribute
506460 you felt kind of useless because you knew you couldnt help anybody you just felt kind of lost
506461 i feel good to be in the position i am to help contribute and make this team better
506462 they set examples for us young guys for what we need to do so its always good to have people like that in front of you

506469 i feel great im lucky as much as ive played over the years im fortunate to still be as healthy as i am
506470 if man you be in heart not adamant forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is will you decide what men shall live what men shall die it may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor mans child oh god to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust
506471 ill give you mr scrooge the founder of the feast
506472 i wish i had him here id give him a piece of my mind to feast upon and i hope hed have a good appetite for it

506476 a place where miners live who labour in the bowels of the earth
506477 so my question is in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead we are talking about attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general or ambiguous kind of phenomenon but a phenomenon that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and jevon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st pete police and the jena six and hurricane katrina the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interest and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or the black community in this country
506478 mr mckinnon is charged with the biggest military computer hack of all time
506479 the mineral estate is dominant over the surface owners when it comes to mineral exploration and production that precedent was set probably over 100 years ago
506480 we have very high expectations and standards for our employees
506481 anytime this happens with an officer its disappointing because its a reflection on our department
506482 we have to move forward to the nsg we are going to keep up this momentum
506483 the countries acknowledge indias requirements and legitimacy of india asking for access to nuclear energy and they seem to acknowledge that this is in their benefit
506484 the industry is probably receptive to public policy changes that they wouldnt have considered before
506485 i was given a word last night while praying over your son and i wanted to find you and tell you
506486 his cultural explanation combined with a contextualized view of the conditions in which people lived at the time on the rhine and mosel is very convincing and is superior to the arguments about ergot which is a compound like lsd
506487 in both cases we see cultural issues impacting on collective behavior
506488 thus in groups subject to severe social and economic hardship trance can be highly contagious
506489 people dancing wildly in a state of trance convinced that they were possessed by spirits
506490 outbreaks of psychogenic illness are likely to be more common than is currently appreciated and many go unrecognized
506491 attempt to separate persons with illness associated with the outbreak
506492 are real rumors and reports of suspected causes are not equivalent to confirmed results
506493 tells us much about the extraordinary supernaturalism of late medieval people but it also reveals the extremes to which fear and irrationality can lead us
506494 why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders
506495 why do you also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition for god commanded saying honor your father and mother and he that curses father or mother let him die the death but you say whoever shall say to his father or mother it is a gift by whatever you might be profited by and doesnt honor his father or mother he shall be free thus have you made the commandment of god of no effect by your tradition isaiah prophesied of you saying this people draws nigh unto me with their mouths and honored me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
506496 hear and understand its not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man but that which comes out of the mouth defiles the man
506497 did you know that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying
506498 every plant which my heavenly father has not planted shall be rooted up if the blind lead the blind both shall fall in the ditch

506500 it is not meet to take the childrens bread and cast it to dogs
506501 o woman great is your faith and her daughter was made whole from that very hour we read in matthew 7 6 that were not supposed to cast our pearls before swine if you recall from our study of matthew 7 swine are those that arent receptive of the message of christ were attempting to share with them canaan in order for jesus to call them dogs they had to be unreceptive to the love of god he had to offer
506502 i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat i wont send them away fasting lest they faint in the way
506503 where in the wilderness are we going to find enough bread in the wilderness to feed so great a multitude
506504 eww victoria secrets models theyre so skinny how is that feminine you can see her ribs
506505 hey hot stuff back that ass up here and let me get some grub on
506506 its not about race its about policy in this country
506507 if they have enough sense to apologize shouldnt they have enough sense to repair
506508 obama is always talking about his past as a community organizer but again and again day after day hes backtracking surrendering flip flopping and appointing the worst corporatist advisers you can imagine

506520 the preacher man says its the end of time says that americas rivers are going dry the interest is up stock markets down you guys gotta be careful walkin around here this late at night this is the perfect place to get jumped
506521 so says the preacher man but i dont go by what he says
506522 it is also possible that under certain circumstances either the companys regulated subsidiaries or executives or others associated with the company or its subsidiaries could face suspension bar or loss of license
506523 earned brokerage commission income on securities transactions executed by value line securities inc on behalf of the funds
506524 were cleared on a fully disclosed basis through non affiliated brokers who received a portion of the gross commission
506525 the value line funds would be charged 4 9 cents per share on two thirds of its trades those trades would be then executed by another broker at roughly 2 cents a share
506526 i asked them my funds are paying 2 million a year what are the fund shareholders getting in return
506527 the vast majority of 12b 1 fees were not spent on behalf of the fund shareholders
506528 vls in november 2004 suspended effectuation of trades through vls for any of the value line funds
506529 today has been a very long day and i stretched my lead by just four seconds from mikko but it is better than nothing it is not over though and tomorrow i will push hard on the first long stage i am confident though because there is only 40kms on the last leg
506530 we have very high expectations and standards for our employees
506531 anytime this happens with an officer its disappointing because its a reflection on our department
506532 could theoretically be auctioned off in fee simple with no strings attached
506533 heres what i was saying and i think it should be undisputed i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
506534 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical
506535 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
506536 if you think about this week what theyve been good at is distraction
506537 youve got statistics saying weve lost another 50 000 jobs that floridas in recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about were paris and britney and so theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
506538 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families
506539 it shall be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed
506540 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
506541 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
506542 we think its got a lot of humor in it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
506543 obama uses race card again but this time admits it
506544 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
506545 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everybody elses business or their personal lives its inappropriate lohan told the photographers as she made her way through los angeles international airport
506546 ronson 30 said in an update on her facebook page that bratton should talk less and do more
506547 at a news conference on thursday bratton dismissed a reporters question that his remark about lohan was inappropriate no one is more supportive of gay rights than i am he said
506548 not holding my breath on that one a tad too bleak

506564 when hes feels like hes ready to go hell go
506565 there is a difference between being injured and being hurt
506566 tom knows the difference so when he can play hell be back in the lineup
506567 ritter has one of the most compelling stories in american politics
506568 hes got such keen judgment hes going to make the right decision about who should serve as vice president of the united states of america im just confident about that
506569 well look forward to hearing who that is and hopefully hell tell us who it is pretty soon
506570 ive continued to voice my concerns because it does not properly honor our people those flight 93 heroes
506571 none of us should have to defend ourselves as americans
506572 the fact that we have americans acting like terrorists is even more disturbing
506573 our sons beamer and burnett and 38 others on that fateful morning were united
506574 so im sad today to find us on opposite sides
506575 what makes me proud is when i look back three and a half years ago to when i first joined the club obviously its hard to start at a new club but the way everton made me feel from the start to now and how easy everything has been since then for me has made me happy everybody has always been there to help not just me but every single player whos joined the club i think thats the most important thing as a player youll have good times and bad times but that will always stay there all the friends i have here are really good friends and that is something i will remember once ive left football
506576 i dont know theres been a few really nice games and really nice goals i remember a really nice game we played last season against fiorentina obviously the way it ended wasnt the best but for 120 minutes everyone enjoyed that game it was like going another step forward for the club even though we lost the penalties we deserved to win on the night
506577 hi to gary we had a great time when we went over there he and his wife were so pleased to see me thank you to them but yes i am thinking of the spain squad and hopefully i can play for them this season
506578 many the way i put my socks boots shinpads the way i get to the pitch every single thing has to be the same everytime i play
506579 yes a few i like watching sport and movies i like reading and i also like learning about physio i like to know when you get injured how to get your body back properly and the best way to do that its something i really like and try to learn from the physios here i like to learn some languages too i try to learn italian portuguese english french i like that
506580 were just so shocked the whole law enforcement community is shocked
506581 you cant believe it it just goes to show you anywhere anytime the world is getting more bizarre all the time
506582 we are concerned for those who are injured and their families
506583 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
506584 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
506585 maybe theyll let manny leave in the seventh inning with the rest of the fans
506586 we couldnt all be cowboys so some of us are clowns
506587 the situation is critical for the future of the internet economy
506588 hello joyce the confirmed speakers right now are the ceo of 8tv deputy chief editor of the sun and the head of our american degree department dr steven baptist

506593 es un buen zurdo t cnicamente muy bueno que puede jugar en todas las posiciones del centro del campo todo el mundo conoce su juego y sabe que es un buen jugador
506594 es normal que me piten la rivalidad existente en inglaterra es como la del real madrid con el barcelona
506595 ha sido un buen d a para nosotros porque ganamos un partido muy duro ante un rival que ya est preparado f sicamente para jugar la liga alemana hicimos un buen encuentro
506596 hemos ganando un partido dif cil porque el rival lleva m s tiempo entrenando que nosotros siempre es importante ganar estos partidos ante buenos equipos
506597 creo que el partido de ma ana ante el arsenal va a ser a n m s dif cil que el de hoy porque tienen un equipo muy bueno y nosotros estamos cogiendo bien la forma en este momento
506598 es la primera vez que juego en un estadio tan hist rico y he acabado muy contento
506599 hemos jugado ante un equipo al que le queda una semana para comenzar la liga y el equipo ha estado de sobresaliente hay que estar contentos porque hemos llevado el peso del partido y al final hemos ganado
506600 me da pena irme porque estoy en el mejor equipo del mundo pero hemos decidido que me tengo que ir un a o fuera para formarme lo aprovechar para volver m s fuerte de un f tbol diferente y regresar el a o que viene por la puerta grande

506603 he has helped on the distance and i think 50 percent of what i have done is because of the caddie
506604 i dont think i have enough power to play on the lpga like physical condition
506605 im happy for what he did and hes a great player and he seems like the greg norman of old
506606 but ive got to go out there tomorrow and play golf and i dont think greg norman is going to help me around so i have to do it on my own
506607 of course i would love to be closer if not in the lead
506608 but this is my position there is nothing i can do about it i have nothing to lose i hope to get a good start tomorrow and we will see
506609 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
506610 today was a little better more regular golf i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
506611 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow
506612 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
506613 like most things in life the funds outflow will be a combination of many things you see that people do tend to react to changes in the market and get out of funds at the wrong time if they can that is
506614 you can focus on what you are good at which is finding property deals and we can focus on what we are good at which is moving property deals and we have a lovely marriage together
506615 we are going to show you how you can work half the hours you work and double your income we are going to show you how to create wealth out of thin air
506616 we have been in this business for over six months and nothing has come of any of the properties we have presented
506617 the only reason i bought into the franchise was because i had the understanding that there was a database of buyers ready to buy but from the start there have been no buyers
506618 i cant find the time to spend looking for properties only to find they cant sell them
506619 id very much like my money back but i dont think they will do that somehow
506620 he jones promised us he would do a large marketing campaign which really has failed to surface
506621 i presented them with three deals all of them fell over
506622 we were led to believe that all we had to do was find the deals and there would be buyers to take them on but it didnt work out that way at all
506623 the five year programme has only been operating for six months and already blue peak is delivering real results with an operational system that has completed numerous transactions around new zealand for both customers and licensees
506624 the first phase of the marketing plan has also been rolled out with an investment of hundreds of thousands of dollars including print and radio advertising ongoing upgrades to the website www
506625 it is disappointing to us that a small number of individuals have chosen to breach their contracts with us by airing their concerns through the media as opposed to activating the proper channels
506626 we are at a loss to understand what they are basing their inaccurate claims on but we do appreciate that with the downturn in the new zealand economy it is possible that some licence holders have overcommitted themselves and might now be struggling to keep up with their licence fee payments
506627 we are going to become the number one delivery system for property in new zealand
506628 if we give you the deposit and the bank gives you the other 90 or 95 you dont need any money
506629 have we done our homework with the real estate agents and with the finance groups yes we have im comfortable with what we are doing because we have been very thorough before we have got to this point
506630 you have to have a university degree earn 100 000 living in an urban area with an impeccable credit history
506631 since blue peaks inception it has generated millions and millions of dollars of loan books with customers
506632 im still looking for properties but not for blue peak im selling them myself
506633 we just do not discuss any business relating to affco or dairy trust
506634 when dacey became involved with dairy trust we did not want to compromise his position there
506635 the family sold a property at the end of may and that allowed us to resume building our stock in affco
506636 i dont have any involvement with the joe brown farms activities
506637 any information i become aware of i keep to myself absolutely so there was no knowledge of the olam transaction from my direction
506638 well just see what comes out weve got nothing to hide
506639 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
506640 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
506641 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
506642 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
506643 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
506644 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
506645 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
506646 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
506647 a lot of our growth has been on the back of the growth of the new zealand wine industry and the swing away from canned beer
506648 screw top bottles per se dont mean more business for us but we have certainly coat tailed on the boost to sales they have meant to the local industry especially overseas
506649 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
506650 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
506651 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
506652 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
506653 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
506654 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
506655 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
506656 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
506657 you only need to set aside a few minutes a day
506658 a very nice guy particularly as he offered to refund dads money if he couldnt use the program
506659 i was in a meeting mate its easier to take a message
506660 he doesnt actually necessarily want to talk he deals with clients
506661 maintaining quiet base with no products out in the market
506662 its none of your business im afraid its nothing to do with this
506663 a permanent income from a small outlay you only need to set aside a few minutes a day
506664 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
506665 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
506666 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
506667 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
506668 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
506669 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
506670 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
506671 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
506672 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
506673 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
506674 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
506675 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
506676 there is uncertainty as to whether the company and group will be able to continue to trade as a going concern and therefore whether it will be able to pay its debts as they fall due however the directors are confident in the ability of the company and group to continue as a going concern in addition the company and group has negotiated new and ongoing borrowing facilities with its lenders
506677 if the financial support of lenders is withdrawn the company and group may be unable to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and adjustments may have to be made to reflect the situation that assets may need to be realised other than in the normal course of business at amounts which could differ significantly from the amounts at which they are currently recorded in the statements of financial position
506678 since the accounts were published the business has been performing very strongly and generating very strong cash flows
506679 the process we are in is very clear in that we are looking for an injection of funds for growth and i think that speaks for itself
506680 the business is in a very sound position theres no question about that whatsoever
506681 hell operates at the gourmet end of the pizza market and the effects of the economy are playing out slightly differently in different parts of the country
506682 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
506683 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
506684 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
506685 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
506686 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
506687 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
506688 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
506689 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
506690 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
506691 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
506692 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
506693 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
506694 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
506695 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
506696 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
506697 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
506698 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
506699 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
506700 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
506701 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
506702 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
506703 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
506704 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
506705 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
506706 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
506707 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
506708 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
506709 i watched the first reel of the print of the hungarian national film archive to find two additional shots two additional sentences and different angles of already known shots

506723 its possible russia could use this to react to us plans for a missile defence system in central europe
506724 we must defend our national interests also in the area of security
506725 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
506726 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
506727 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
506728 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

506769 que esto depender de la voluntad y la posici n de la dirigencia pero el congreso expres la necesidad de que los radicales encontremos la soluci n sin llegar a la interna

506801 depending on whether hes got his ladder with him or not
506802 we completely reject kirkuk becoming a part of kurdistan and consider this the beginning of a crisis and strife in the city it could lead to civil war in kirkuk
506803 and with the big hand pointing upwards and my little hand pointing towards my digital watch i notice that it is time to go
506804 what is a crime i think is not giving feedback to the people who are trying to put stuff out there
506805 that the third row on the fourth column must be a five and due to the fact that its cousins are all used elsewhere within the square its neighbour to the left must be an eight
506806 not after what ive seen it makes no sense the whole thing is inexplicable in the extreme
506807 so inexplicable that you saw fit to cross town from the other side of the city to see me even abandoning your hansom and running when it was stopped by a fallen onion cart at the end of the street
506808 my running could be deduced by my lack of breath and presumably the smell of onions about me but how the devil did you know ive come from the city
506809 the running and onion cart i saw with my own eyes through the window
506810 im afraid that my help solving some of your more complex crimes has left you blind to seeking the obvious answers occams razor old chap
506811 i had to only look at the colour of the stone dust under your nails and the smear of mildew on your left shoulder
506812 that kind of mildew only grows on kentish ragstone of the kind used to build the ancient roman wall of london there are only very few intact segments of this wall and nearly all of them are in the same area at the heart of london the city itself i deduced youd recently tried to climb the wall there
506813 i was trying to climb an old bit of wall in the minories to prove a point to myself more than anything else but let me start at the beginning
506814 a few weeks ago we made a breakthrough in our investigations of the compton association
506815 the very same wed been given a tip off that an american in town on business a man from boston by the name of taylor was none other than the head of the whole operation i immediately put a team of my best men onto him watching from a distance and taking great care not to arouse his suspicions
506816 we watched his activities for a few weeks and weve pretty much got all the evidence we need to nail him two days ago he took lodgings in a house just opposite fenchurch street station we were certain that he was getting ready to end his affairs in london so i posted men all around the house there wasnt an inch of the property that wasnt being watched many people arrived and left the lodgings but they were all professional ladies
506817 you know ladies of the night this particular lodging house is known for housing a number of them we turn a blind eye because
506818 because someone extremely high up in your organisation is a regular customer
506819 there are some mysteries that the yard would not thank you to investigate holmes nor would you find them particularly rewarding if you get my meaning
506820 so several of these ladies arrived and left but it became obvious that our man had gone to ground i became impatient and ordered that the house be stormed making sure that all escape passages were covered
506821 several of the ladies are threatening to protest outside the yard
506822 precisely every inch of the place was searched there were no trap doors no hidden rooms weve gone through the place top to bottom hes simply disappeared
506823 did you find any evidence of male occupants in the house
506824 no men entered or left during our watch but there were three men in the house when we arrived none matched the description of taylor
506825 i thought of that one of the men was two feet shorter than taylor and the second was unquestionably a genuine negro
506826 and clothing id take it that these men were in various states of undress
506827 did you think to match the discarded clothing to the men present in the various rooms
506828 no i had no reason to suspect our man would try to escape naked
506829 i had reason to suspect that one of my men posted to the rear of the building had become distracted by the goings on in one of the rooms and may have missed taylor escaping the back way this particular building backs onto a closed courtyard formed by the buildings and a portion of the old london wall he would have to scale the wall itself
506830 a particularly tricky operation with the wall so slimy from the recent rain
506831 after attempting it myself i decided it would be impossible especially for a naked man anyway the officer charged with watching the area promises that nothing got past him
506832 were not but why the devil did you ask about the clothes
506833 leave it with me and by the end of the night i have a feeling we will have found your man inspector meet us at the lodgings at midnight
506834 the verisimilitude of my disguise relies in part on its lack of skill now are you ready to escort me into town
506835 i think youll find well be quite accepted at this club watson
506836 show some manners watson not all gentlemens clubs in london are as straight laced and antisocial as the diogenes some clubs cater for men with more particular tastes who want to meet other men who share their interests now i am going to socialise and i suggest you do the same
506837 lestrades quarry is still very much within his reach and we need to inform him of this fact
506838 you should have more trust in your mens abilities to trail a suspect without being seen
506839 no in fact he was so confident in his privacy this evening that he decided to indulge a hobby at one of londons lesser known attractions a club in the minories watson and i have spent the evening there there were many men at this club but only one of which was speaking in an american accent a bostonian accent and spending money freely
506840 you and your men were perhaps too accustomed to turning a blind eye to the activities of the female occupants of these lodgings you never noticed that one of the women leaving this afternoon was not actually a woman at all
506841 in about half an hour your quarry will return blissfully unaware you and your men will be waiting patiently for him just inside the door look for the rather fetching yellow dress
506842 how did you know the password for the club in the minories

506847 one of my concerns is that we make sure we dont value speed as a goal so much that we drive down the values of cases and dilute our response to crime in a way thats not productive
506848 our first goals have been to make the system more efficient not more lenient
506849 well continue to focus to make sure the process is efficient
506850 we think that everything weve done is making some incremental change in getting some cases resolved
506851 one of the barriers to getting some of these reforms was the assistant district attorneys and judges dont feel like they have time to do any of these things
506852 to have someone who they can trust has been helpful

506869 he relates well to all players from superstars to guys on the practice field but the best thing about john is that he doesnt lie he says it like it really is all the time now there may be times when you dont like it but its important to know as a player what he expects and wants veterans appreciate that it may bother some of the younger guys but the veterans tell them thats the way it is in the nfl

507032 five years after the 1990 worlds lang ping was offered the job of coaching the chinese national team
507033 she accepted i hear after much thinking for it wasnt so easy for her to drop her studies and career path in the usa in order to take on such a cumbersome task
507034 usa volleyball is honored to be able to reach an agreement with jenny to be the next usa womens national team coach
507035 she won every major event as a player for china during her career and was clearly the dominant player in the world in the 1980s
507036 and she transitioned more seamlessly than almost anyone in volleyball history to her role as a coach leading china to a silver medal at the atlanta olympics in 1996 and successfully coaching professionally in italy for many years
507037 it is a good choice for the continued solidification of the usa women among the worlds elite and it is a bold choice for the future of female volleyball coaches in the u
507038 by hiring jenny usa volleyball is sending a loud message to the world that we are serious about having our womens team be the best and to the nation that we are committed to the advancement of females at the top levels of coaching
507039 its extremely unfortunate that the coaching community will not be able to hear jenny speak at this years avca convention especially coming off such a wonderful performance at the grand champions cup
507040 this is the main reason i am here this week
507041 i have had the chance to see a lot of different players i am very happy because they are so focused they give all of their effort and they are taking this tryout very seriously i have seen a lot of passion here today click

507043 it will be a hard decision to set the roster
507044 we need to give the young players a chance to play and for many of the players just out of the university system it will be their first international experience
507045 if lang collides with china as opponents during womens volleyball matches at the beijing olympics it will be difficult to accept for the new generation of chinese players for coach chen zhonghe who was once her assistant and for the 1 3 billion chinese in the stadium or in front of their tv sets
507046 little did sue woodstra know that a relationship that started out as a fierce competition would end up landing her a job in the olympics

507048 we will face great competition in every round of the grand prix and will play some of the top ranked teams twice china russia cuba so we have a big challenge ahead of us
507049 we have some young players on the roster and they will be exposed to a very high level of play in this tournament so we can see how they handle that and hope that they adjust and improve as the tournament goes on
507050 we want to improve our teamwork and skills in preparation for the olympic qualification tournaments at the end of this year

507087 as i said before the start of the tournament the reason we were here was to make progress in the way we play said nowak
507088 looking at this game maybe were a still a little bit na ve about international football going into games like this we have to expect that theyll be physical with a lot of contact so we have to prevail for us i think the second half we played much better progress has been made and we expect to go to tianjin tomorrow and polish the things that we need to this week

507094 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open florida s coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices obama said in an interview with the palm beach post if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done obama said
507095 obama would consider off shore drilling as part of comprehensive energy plan
507096 now the latest scheme is well were going to drill offshore now i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey i understand how desperate folks are i met a guy who couldnt go on a job search that lost his job couldnt go on a job search because of the high price of gas just couldnt fill up his tank i met a teacher in south dakota who loved her job as a teacher on an indian reservation she had to quit because the drive was too far it was taking up too much of her paycheck i know how bad people are hurting so if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it

507113 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
507114 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
507115 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
507116 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
507117 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
507118 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

507139 my efforts here will push the ministry to make serious steps now they have no excuse we have a prepared group and they are not secretary material
507140 this group is the leading edge of modernity for women
507141 theyre going to become models for the other women unless we have a huge conservative reaction
507142 saudi women tend to think about their community more than they think about their own issues
507143 education is always a main factor in the development of any society especially an education with a global perspective
507144 if education is available they will have a greater opportunity in competing with men

507152 nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free
507153 nor is it certain that the two races equally free cannot live in the same government
507154 i will say then that i am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race

507157 why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing
507158 thou may not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brother
507159 very lucky to be who he is not white and the country is caught up in this concept
507160 spare thy people o lord and give not thine heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over them
507161 they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods alien laws with abominations provoked they him to anger
507162 take away the heritage of a people and they are easily persuaded
507163 thou art my battle axe and weapons of war for with thee will i break in pieces the nations and with thee will i destroy kingdoms i will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock and i will render unto babylon all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight saith the lord

507168 shayne bannan called me with the news and i was on the table getting treatment with my knee all bandaged up in ice and an electro stimulator attached and he said weve got that second place i looked at my swollen knee and thought oh good for you
507169 then beyond that for me to go and start the time trial id have to have a pretty stellar ride in the road race
507170 every day im doing the physio and treatment on my knee and every day getting better but well decide on monday morning whether i go or adam hansen goes in my place
507171 i dont want to go unless i can do a good result for myself and the team or contribute to a good result for the team so if i dont recover from my injury and am not close to my best i dont mind staying at home

507176 one in four of the nations more than 590 000 bridges is rated as either in need of repair or inadequate to handle todays traffic
507177 steel concrete asphalt and earth work have increased at least 50 percent
507178 and oil has quadrupled in the last four years forcing states to delay needed repairs
507179 we need federal intervention and federal intervention at a big level
507180 my objective is that those lives lost in the i 35 bridge tragedy will not have been lost in vain that indeed the congress will act the president will sign a bill state departments of transportation will act
507181 inattention by the states to their bridge needs and sort of an overconfidence that theyve built bridges to high standards and dont need to revisit them is the principal concern i have and i think the underlying cause for escalating deteriorating bridges corrosion and metal fatigue
507182 we are going from pin to pin and doing phased array ultrasound which is a volumetric test to look for cracks or corrosion in the pins
507183 what were looking for here is something out of the ordinary
507184 typically were looking for cracks and were also looking for large areas of corrosion visual inspection would not be able to identify these areas so we need to use this volumetric test
507185 i think the bridge collapse has made bridge inspections more of a priority
507186 theres been some progress but there could be more the other area that should get attention is maintenance
507187 what we have today is crumbling and neglected infrastructure words that seem to go together all the time
507188 and the reason is weve never planned for how we should adequately pay for the use of that facility over the design life of an asset
507189 often people will hear crack on a bridge and think its ready to fall down but on a secondary member its very common and on a steel bridge probably about 90 percent have some kind of crack on them
507190 crash crashes into things all the time thereby the name he is not exactly mentally stable as you probably can tell just ignore him if he says something weird
507191 he is the most powerful warrior in this clan as you can see crash and crush are brothers
507192 anyway he is not exactly clever so he just fights with brute strength no brain but of duty he is harmless like a kitten
507193 where have you been ive been looking for you sweetheart
507194 and you must be the idiot that flirts with every female he runs into
507195 he doesnt say much really but he is incredibly smart
507196 his other senses are way sharper than normal what he cant hear or smell i will see with my eyes we are a perfect team and with a new set of eyes well be unsurpassable
507197 there is a cave not too far away from here i saw a lonely bear cub and i thought he was left alone i went over to say hello but then his mother appeared right in front of me frightened i backed but i crashed into the father then i just ran of and climbed up in this tree i did not dare to come down at first because i wasnt sure if they had left or not you never know with bears they are more clever than they look ill tell you deadly too one strike with a paw would crush my skull
507198 i dont see any bears around now so i guess were safe
507199 its my typical unluck to get in these situations but its typical my luck to get away from them without a scratch
507200 what is your job im a spy or whatever i might call it

507202 the document is deeply unhelpful to the commissioner it shows he was there if he was there its just nonsense to say that he wasnt having an influence
507203 presentations were made by the bidders to the evaluation panel and sir ian blair however at no time did sir ian participate in the evaluation
507204 there have to be grave concerns they will be left shorthanded
507205 are you out of your mind this is still a male dominated world its women who need saving screw the men
507206 its absolutely necessary that i find out who he is to have a normal existence as a human being thats not negotiable in any way
507207 it would be nice if he wanted to meet me but that would be something i want rather than something needed
507208 boys thank you for taking your seats and being quiet while we explain our womens history month project
507209 boys get in here sit down and shut up now
507210 oh thats when a guy calls you up and just needs you to come over and have sex with him and then go home
507211 and now because so many young girls have been told that its empowering to pursue boys aggressively theres no longer any need for boys to woo girls or even to commit to a date
507212 the girls are available in every sense of the word and the boys know it
507213 hooking up is great but at some point you get tired of everything meaning nothing
507214 no honey you stay in bed ill go see what that noise is

507218 two years ago was a horrible election for republicans in a horrible environment the environment is now worse for republicans than it was two years ago and that means the election results could be as bad or even worse
507219 we need to have disaster planning and we need to worry
507220 this drives home the risk people face and the consumer should get the message
507221 dont just take for granted all the things that machines are doing for you
507222 people are taking this pretty seriously and patching their servers
507223 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
507224 we discussed with the patient that he would have to deal with the fact that his hands were from somebody else
507225 but this was discussed before the first heart transplant and in reality nobody really cared about that
507226 it is going to be quite difficult to get any sensation the higher it is the harder it is
507227 flexing and bending the arm is also going to be hard
507228 he is going to require intensive physiotherapy every day for many months
507229 all too often i have the difficult job of telling families that their loved ones have been killed in acts of violence i am pleased that we can now say that many of these cases are being quickly closed
507230 my thanks to the detectives who have been working around the clock gathering information and making these arrests
507231 the provisions of the hyde act and not the assurances made by the indian prime minister in parliament are shaping the course of the indo u s nuclear deal through the various stages
507232 nuclear facilities can be withdrawn from safeguards only after these facilities are no longer usable for any nuclear activity
507233 this belies the prime ministers assurance in parliament that indias civilian nuclear facilities would be put under perpetual iaea safeguards only under the strictly reciprocal condition of uninterrupted fuel supply guarantees
507234 does the 123 agreement with the u s provide any such fuel supply guarantee nor can the iaea ensure uninterrupted fuel supply since it is only a monitoring agency
507235 we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric
507236 we have only to see the rapid integration within association of south east asian nations asean and its emergence as an important bloc in asia to understand the opportunities that beckon
507237 terrorists and extremists know no borders the recent attack on the indian embassy in kabul and the serial blasts in bangalore and ahmedabad are gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place here in south asia we must act jointly and with determination to fight this scourge we must defend the values of pluralism peaceful coexistence and the rule of law
507238 these terrorist attacks are a rapidly growing threat not just to afghanistan or india but for the entire saarc region
507239 no amount of outrage and condemnation can suffice to express the anger and frustration we all feel when faced with such mindless brutality and violence in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto
507240 the deadly fangs of terrorism are spreading across the region they threaten to disrupt peace and stability we must combat this menace of terrorism across the broadest possible spectrum
507241 terrorism has perpetrated brutal attacks in every part of the world we condemn the heinous terrorist attacks in afghanistan india and pakistan in recent times which caused unnecessary loss of valuable lives and property
507242 unequivocally condemned these senseless and reprehensible acts of violence regardless of how sublime noble and even desperate a cause may be
507243 shattered the entire value system of peoples and interferes with socio economic development
507244 why the hurry when the next hearing of the supreme court is scheduled on august 17
507245 the bharatiya janata party bjp is a party to the decisions of the previous coalition government headed by h d kumaraswamy and it is imperative for the incumbent chief minister to abide by the cabinet decisions concerned and refrain from deviating in favour of the company which has been seeking land to complete the peripheral and link roads around bangalore as part of phase 1 of the expressway project
507246 it is the duty of the present government to ensure that such major development projects particularly of road connectivity are completed without further delay further the expressway project should be in accordance with the orders of the apex court
507247 will do everything to put india pakistan dialogue process back on track
507248 i entertain my guests either in coimbatore or karur which has better facilities and soon i am planning to build a guest house so that the arrangement is permanent
507249 is building dams on rivers flowing into the country on the other hand it is establishing training centres in afghanistan where it is teaching its agents how to carry out terrorist acts in pakistan while our rulers insist that we should have good relations with the afghan government india is imposing wars upon us still our rulers pursuing a policy of unilateral friendship under foreign pressure have promised the world we will not fight with india
507250 we will develop finance build and operate the food court and theme park on bot basis the fun n food village is being developed on the designs and consultancy from scenic route ltd of uk in conjunction with their counterparts snomakx hyderabad
507251 when i said we have to kick udaikkanum those in karnataka opposing supply of water to tamil nadu i was referring to those who indulged in violence and not everyone in general yes i should have been more specific
507252 i have been quoted as saying that i have learnt my lesson well life is all about learning
507253 as a senior technician and as someone who has been in the industry for 40 years i wish to say that what has happened has and whatever happens hence will be for our good
507254 this is an issue pertaining not just to kuselan but to all tamil films i say this as someone observing the industry from a distance
507255 rajini only said that if his words had hurt anyone he regrets having said that
507256 he had not apologised he had only said that he was concerned that his words had possibly hurt the people of karnataka
507257 we wanted to honour the technicians involved in the film and the director and producers readily agreed i hope this trend continues
507258 i will follow this practice of sharing a portion of profits made on a film with technicians in my upcoming films too soundarya has agreed i will be speaking to director shankar too
507259 when we decided that each would get 33 per cent rajini sir instantly said the remaining one per cent should to go to the technicians
507260 i have verified here that the two persons were killed due to a local land dispute
507261 we have to have tie ups with a b c d and e but the nsg is a cartel so all countries could get together and the redundancy we are seeking to build could get reduced to a knot in one stroke
507262 our aim is for the redundancy to remain protected this is the main thing we have to achieve that is what is behind the slogan of a clean and unconditional exemption and i am firm and committed that we must get this
507263 we have six reactors that are already under separate safeguards all of them can be subsumed under the issa and as and when someone wants to cooperate with us everything else can be brought into this as well the nsg guidelines are there for the suppliers but if someone wants to trade with india the issa is useful
507264 first multilateral instrument that recognises there is a nuclear programme in the country which remains outside the civil programme
507265 so i believe the issa is useful by itself though our intention is not to remain there but to go beyond and start cooperation
507266 if you want to go to a new equilibrium you have to be in troubled waters first in a frozen situation you cannot make change
507267 and there is no reason to assume those intentions are benign i e that they are just looking for business opportunities
507268 what is needed is courage and determination to see this through
507269 conditions will take away with one hand what has been given with the other
507270 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
507271 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
507272 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
507273 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
507274 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
507275 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
507276 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
507277 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties
507278 the worlds fertilizer demand should grow by 3 percent per year over the next decade it had been about 1 5 percent over the past decade
507279 bringing on a new potash mine can take several years
507280 that process will take us about 12 years and 3 billion
507281 developing countries around the world are becoming more affluent and as they do their diets are improving as well
507282 in china and india alone about 1 1 billion people are expected to move from the lower class to the middle class in the next 20 years
507283 instead of a rice and grain based diet people want more protein in their diet which means more meat
507284 weve had four consecutive years of record grain production in the world and we still cant keep up with the demand
507285 as fast as we can pull it out of the ground and process it we can sell it
507286 we expect the biggest growth to come from china southeast asia india pakistan and latin america

507307 nok air has no official statement regarding its marketing strategies but if one looks carefully at what we are doing they might be able to figure it out
507308 since nok air started flying to phuket and krabi the number of competing flights increased dramatically making these routes very competitive there is however little or no competition to many less popular destinations and nok air has most probably taken the initiative to exploit this niche by providing more lucrative services to other destinations in the south such as haad yai trang and nakhon sri thammarat

507343 to qualify for a tick simply by changing the serving size recommendation i think is just not consistent with the principle of the tick i mean you could in an extreme situation say ill have half a piece of this chocolate bar instead of a whole chocolate bar and it meets the tick the pick the tick programme is trying to get manufacturers to reformulate and produce foods that have less salt and less energy and less saturated fat and thats good but in this food product it just doesnt exist
507344 there clearly is a downside when its consumed in too large an amount but its the real world and i think its better that we make the recommendation in a positive way and educate people about the benefits of this product with trim milk as a healthy milk drink
507345 were trying to be responsible in terms of the whole obesity environment

507363 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty

507399 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
507400 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
507401 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
507402 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
507403 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
507404 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life

507412 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
507413 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
507414 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
507415 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
507416 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
507417 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
507418 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good

507434 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
507435 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service

507441 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
507442 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
507443 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
507444 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
507445 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived

507448 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
507449 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
507450 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

507455 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
507456 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
507457 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
507458 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
507459 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
507460 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
507461 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
507462 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
507463 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
507464 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
507465 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
507466 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
507467 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
507468 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
507469 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
507470 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
507471 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
507472 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
507473 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
507474 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
507475 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
507476 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
507477 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
507478 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
507479 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
507480 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
507481 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
507482 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
507483 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
507484 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
507485 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
507486 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
507487 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
507488 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
507489 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
507490 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
507491 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
507492 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
507493 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
507494 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
507495 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
507496 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
507497 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
507498 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
507499 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
507500 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
507501 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
507502 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
507503 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
507504 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
507505 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
507506 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
507507 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
507508 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
507509 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
507510 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
507511 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
507512 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
507513 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
507514 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
507515 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
507516 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
507517 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
507518 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
507519 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
507520 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
507521 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
507522 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
507523 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
507524 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
507525 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
507526 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
507527 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
507528 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
507529 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
507530 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
507531 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
507532 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
507533 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
507534 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
507535 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
507536 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
507537 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
507538 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
507539 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
507540 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
507541 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
507542 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
507543 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
507544 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
507545 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
507546 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
507547 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
507548 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
507549 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
507550 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
507551 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
507552 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
507553 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
507554 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
507555 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
507556 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
507557 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
507558 i think my overall reaction is that its really sad that in 2008 i have people watching every single move i make
507559 when theres a big game between the cubs and brewers going on its sad
507560 hey hey hey look at the photos of erin andrews that had lou pinella ask if she were on a modeling assignment
507561 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
507562 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
507563 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
507564 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
507565 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
507566 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
507567 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
507568 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
507569 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
507570 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
507571 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
507572 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
507573 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
507574 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
507575 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
507576 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
507577 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
507578 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
507579 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
507580 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
507581 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
507582 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
507583 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
507584 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
507585 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
507586 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
507587 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
507588 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
507589 if the vice president says its do able i believe
507590 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
507591 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
507592 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
507593 nos repugna que de juana est en la calle pero creemos en la ley
507594 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
507595 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
507596 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
507597 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
507598 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
507599 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
507600 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
507601 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
507602 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
507603 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
507604 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
507605 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
507606 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
507607 the very magnitude of the illegality cannot serve as its shield
507608 the money of the state shall not be given or loaned to or in aid of any private corporation or association or private undertaking nor shall the credit of the state be given or loaned to or in aid of any individual or public or private corporation or association or private undertaking but the foregoing provisions shall not apply to any fund or property now held or which may hereafter be held by the state for educational mental health or mental retardation purposes
507609 they represent the triumph of efforts to prevent improvidence to make useless pressure from special interest groups to safeguard the credit of the state and the interests of the people as whole
507610 in the beginning of may our budget director projected our new york state deficit over the next three years at 21 5 billion that was a record but things have changed that number has now erupted to 26 2 billion a staggering 22 percent increase in less than 90 days
507611 distinctly specif ies the sum appropriated and the object or purpose to which it is to be applied
507612 the funds made available through this appropriation shall be utilized for the payment of the costs of eligible projects in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into between the governor the majority leader of the senate and the speaker of the assembly or their designees
507613 distinctly specif ies the sum appropriated and the object or purpose to which it is to be applied
507614 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
507615 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
507616 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
507617 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
507618 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
507619 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
507620 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
507621 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
507622 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
507623 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
507624 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
507625 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
507626 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
507627 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
507628 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
507629 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
507630 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
507631 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
507632 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
507633 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
507634 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
507635 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
507636 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
507637 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
507638 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
507639 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
507640 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
507641 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
507642 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
507643 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
507644 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
507645 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
507646 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
507647 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
507648 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
507649 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
507650 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
507651 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
507652 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
507653 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
507654 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
507655 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
507656 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
507657 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
507658 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
507659 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
507660 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
507661 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
507662 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
507663 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
507664 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
507665 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
507666 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
507667 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
507668 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
507669 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
507670 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
507671 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
507672 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
507673 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
507674 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
507675 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
507676 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
507677 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
507678 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
507679 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
507680 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
507681 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
507682 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
507683 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
507684 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
507685 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
507686 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
507687 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
507688 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
507689 theres a mystery going on and im gonna solve it
507690 ive done my research on it i understand that we havent beaten them in quite a while
507691 i go to sleep at night and dream about what that stadium is going to look like on the second game at 8 oclock at night
507692 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
507693 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
507694 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
507695 the 3 5 2 quaking in the us olympic teams hardhats
507696 beam a portly silver haired basso profundo dressed in khaki slacks a sweater vest and brown tasseled loafers that make him look like a retired country club golf pro walks to the front of the room and proceeds to tell the men in the audience how to make their semen taste better
507697 then you can say im eating this cake for you baby

507705 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
507706 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice

507709 im not going to let this put a damper on my day
507710 the game is the game and whatever happens during the game is kind of fun its not taken too seriously and its kind of a light nature the introductions before mean a lot especially to some of the old time players who didnt get the recognition as we do now with television coverage and the internet
507711 my arm is tofu you know what that is its a soft rice bean cake
507712 this is my first one and its something different to be able to play with all of your teammates and enjoy a special day this is the last time ill ever play in this ballpark and this is one of the oldest ballparks that ill ever play in so its an honor to be invited back
507713 you know the day is going to come but you want them to kick you out
507714 you play baseball together and you grow so close i remember walking in the tunnel as an opposing player for the first time and you see the rich history to pitch here in front of the fans you never know whats going to happen i still love it
507715 these men still have pride to wear pinstripes in this day and age
507716 you can only clap for the fans because theyve been such a huge part of it through the years theres been so much history here that even when this place closes i dont know if there will ever be a ballpark that has the memories that this place has right here
507717 its a sad day i always get sad every year when i remember the date
507718 we didnt get through it i know we had to finish the season but we had been talking about how we were going to make a comeback like we did in 78 when we lost thurman it took it out of us
507719 i have great memories of this ballpark but its time to move on
507720 theyre moving on to a bigger and better place new york isnt like anywhere else and they deserve it for their fans
507721 we just felt that giving him a day off and worrying about it tomorrow might be helpful he was swinging the bat so great and i think this has affected it
507722 were going to give him a day off today and see how it feels tomorrow
507723 well make sure we get him back 100 percent hes available for us
507724 its frustrating but i should only be out for a few days and then i can get back in the game
507725 well see how it works with ross in the outfield and billy at first base and try to get some more at bats for him
507726 theres only so much improvement you can have in practice
507727 hes continued to work every day and well see how he does i cant answer how hes going to do
507728 the greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not on our circumstances we carry the seeds of the one or the other about with us in our minds wherever we go
507729 this is my circumstance i can choose my reaction and i choose to react in a positive happy manner

507735 i thought you understood the rules as i explained them yesterday but i see i gave you more credit than you deserved
507736 im sorry sir i forgot i promise it will never happen again

507752 a man must always confront another man before he kills them
507753 dit onderzoek is een voorbeeld van de rijkdom van onaageboorde klimaatinformatie die is opgeslagen in de aarde
507754 dit soort ontdekkingen kunnen ons begrip van het voorspellen van moderne klimaatveranderingen sterk verbeteren
507755 im just sorry that something like this had to happen to me especially again
507756 because i really look at myself as being a person that has high integrity and high character and ive worked a lot of years to get to that
507757 to have these types of errors in judgment is something thats not part of my character its something im deeply sorry about
507758 im sorry that i put myself my family and also the seahawks organization in this type of situation
507759 i also thank them for their caring their concern and their patience in this whole thing not jumping to judgments but really going through a full investigative process to find out everything that was going on
507760 im so confused by all the health related and nutrition information out there i just want to know what is the right thing to do for my health or nutrition needs
507761 give a man a fish you have fed him for today teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime
507762 anything that consumers spend pennies on is eligible for pricing
507763 neither my husband nor my children or my friends know the locations i visit for cpi data because to keep our respondents confidentiality is the most important thing
507764 people can be fired from bls if the agreement is breached
507765 it is my duty to verify that there is no change and then i look at the price same 5 99
507766 probably they have a big stock and want to sell it it is good for the customers though
507767 of course anything that goes down in price is good
507768 rather than buying new cars people try to fix their cars and everybody is looking for small cars
507769 in the grocery store they are getting two bags with what they used to be paying to get three
507770 in the gas station they are paying double what they were paying two years ago
507771 there are a variety of factors that make it difficult to tell how accurate it is foremost of these is housing
507772 are doing a professional but a complicated and difficult job because measuring consumer prices is trying to measure something that is moving
507773 the economy is changing the way people shop is changing and to capture this is not easy
507774 the underlying simplicity of its concept pricing a fixed but representative market basket of goods and services over time
507775 gas and food are high but many other items like housing apparel cars electronics are not
507776 many important things in life school lunch prices social security benefits monetary policies are all set up by cpi
507777 a lack of identity confirmation continues to plague the web b companies must monitor their brand c an opportunity for the real exxon to step forward d the community myself included need to first validate identities
507778 there is scarcely anything in the world that some man cannot make a little worse and sell a little more cheaply the person who buys on price alone is this mans lawful prey
507779 todays wsj shows just how important the employee free choice act efca is to creating a more equal america and addressing corporate power wal mart and cintas are fighting to stop this legislation which would help protect workers who want to unionize
507780 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
507781 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
507782 ive been swinging the bat throwing i picked up the intensity of running today
507783 that is the only way we have been able to activate so far
507784 i suspect its due to the fact that the baseband could not be upgraded to the 1 1 3 required version
507785 some of the progressive members of the religion industrial complex are really social conservatives in liberal clothing and that the deal they are proposing is to give up womens reproductive freedom in exchange for votes
507786 it would be better to use a local recording studio
507787 estoy aterrorizado creo que soy el mejor jugador de este equipo
507788 me imagino que a adiremos sus datos a nuestro scouting para que no nos vuelva a pasar
507789 an ambiguity or inadequacy in the law or a set of rules
507790 surely things are somewhat amiss when a countrys finance minister plays bond salesman for a supposedly privately owned company
507791 allowing the continued operation of the companies as private shareholder owned institutions while the taxpayers are ultimately responsible for their losses recapitulates our experience with the savings and loans less than 20 years ago
507792 i like him i do and he is definitely a bit of a genius lyricist but he is still a kid
507793 he was eight when definitely maybe came out what the fuck am i a 38 year old supposed to say to that they make me feel awkward
507794 what bothers me right now is that we are not the biggest band in the world any more
507795 while virtually everyone involved seems to agree that military people deserve at least equal opportunity when it comes to having their votes counted indications are that in november 2008 many thousands of service members who try to vote will do so in vain
507796 the least we at home can do is to make sure that they are able to enjoy the rights they are being asked to fight to preserve
507797 come nov 5 should the current gop leadership in either house survive to lead in a new congress the lincoln club of orange county will review the financial backing of all congressional republicans and we urge others to do likewise a gop caucus that would re elect such leaders is not one we would likely continue to support because simply put we refuse to support a permanent minority
507798 the perfect symbol of the gop led profligacy that drives us crazy still
507799 epitomize the fiscal recklessness that led to republicans becoming a minority in 2006 its no wonder the republican leadership continued to fail on entitlement reform and a reduction in federal spending
507800 we urge other republican donor groups to reinforce this important beginning
507801 it is not credible to ask the american people to return republicans to the majority when all we offer them is the same group of leaders and policies they so recently rejected
507802 those good hearted folks up there in new york who are running this wonderful speculated enterprise
507803 now we find that these good hearted folks in the futures market have figured how to screw the farmers and the consumers in the city on a whole new product oil
507804 i dont want that to happen with obama to be defeated on an issue that is not important to us and is not a political winner for us
507805 you dont make up a new use for an amendment whose prohibitions arent being violated
507806 i confess i obviously havent listened to the briefs and looked at all the evidence
507807 i dont know all the details and specifics of the d c gun law
507808 we want to do things our way and people think its arrogance so its inevitable some people will get tired of us thats why
507809 dont let the door hit you on the arse on the way out
507810 the country badly needs a head of state who devotes full time to the improvement of the situation in the tribal areas instead of spending time in palace intrigues
507811 even as the u s declared him a key ally against terror militancy grew everywhere
507812 against a possible onslaught by the militant militias that stand ranged all around it
507813 this is as tough a crowd as obama is going to face the whole campaign
507814 im not going to sit back and allow for 14 year appointments of people who dont seem to understand how important it is the fed do its job

507825 each year the united states the united kingdom and canada deport thousands of people convicted of various crimes to their countries of citizenship in the caribbean there is a widely held belief in the caribbean that recent crime troubles can be tied directly to the activities of deportees who have learnt criminal behaviour in the developed countries
507826 they are sending back these violent guys some left here as babies they come back as criminals after their graduation from american prison
507827 these people dont know anyone they dont know our culture most dont have family here or if they do say have an aunt here she doesnt want to take them in because of their criminality crime is entirely out of control

507834 mr mullany was on top of the bed wearing just briefs
507835 there was so much blood around his head the mosquito net around the bed was soaked red
507836 those criminal deportees with skills developed in the us and uk are impacting tremendously on our society
507837 we were sitting down to dinner recently and there was a commotion on the street outside
507838 a woman had been hit in the head with the butt of a gun she recognised her attacker as the son of a local deportee from america but the police never acted even though they knew who he was
507839 it has made grand statements before which have turned out to be hollow the market is now looking for the fsa to follow through

507841 we are prepared to take cases to the regulatory decisions committee to the tribunal and beyond even though we recognise that cases we fight carry more risk and take longer to bring to conclusion

507868 i want to be back helping the raiders push for a finals berth this season
507869 if they want to sack me then ill have to sit back down with my manager dave riolo and my family and discuss what could happen
507870 the worst result we spoke about is that the nrl could de register me which means id have to go overseas
507871 but my priority is to work things out with the raiders and get back playing this year
507872 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings
507873 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
507874 i knew we just needed one or two partnership i was focusing on 10 runs at a time thinking lets just get close
507875 i felt we were just one wicket away if we could have got the likes of morne morkel and paul harris in on that kind of deck i felt we could have won the game
507876 theyve played better cricket than us over the three games
507877 from day one ive thought it seems like hes troubled
507878 i would like to understand why he has done this if he had a change of heart then certainly we would want to sit down and listen to him
507879 we would want to see him back in the nrl and we would want to see him happy if sonny was to say hes sorry for what he did and admit that he made a mistake we would definitely be a party to hearing him out
507880 if sonny bill were to play overseas certainly the door would be closed on his returning to the nrl at any time in the future
507881 we didnt take a lot from the game apart from the fact we were well beaten there are no excuses from our point of view
507882 overall liverpool were better and i have no complaints about the result
507883 from the start of the game we wanted to press and we wanted to win against a good team get the best of foxtel
507884 if somebody comes into your space you have the knowledge to take the power and be in control and to get home to your family
507885 i feel very strong and very knowledgeable i feel like i could get myself out of a situation or at least put up a good fight

507901 visst r det konstigt trots kunskap om att det f rekommer verv ld fr n ordningsvakter tar polisen f r givet att i valet mellan tre nerslagna m nniskor och sju utan en skr ma r det de slagna offren som r de skyldiga
507902 vad r v rst att bli kr nkt och misshandlad att felaktigt d mas i domstol eller den m nga g nger hatiska attityd jag f tt som knivhugg i ryggen och slag rakt i ansiktet detta av samh llets etablissemang som samtidigt gl mmer att det kan vara deras son eller dotter som r kar ut f r n got liknande n sta helg jag t nker inte l ta mig bli klappad p huvudet
507903 l t oss alla hoppas att r ttsv sendet tvingas att lystra och b rja skydda oss folket mot or ttf rdigat v ld fr n deras egna tj nstem n hur l nge kan de blunda f r det uppenbara
507904 sammantaget anser jag mig ha tillr ckligt underlag f r att kunna konstatera att det inte i obetydlig utstr ckning f rekommer obefogat v ld verv ld och ojuste beteende fr n ordningsvakters sida i samband med ingripanden mot krogg ster
507905 det finns tillr ckligt underlag f r att h vda att det tycks f rekomma att vissa ordningsvakter i inte obetydlig omfattning talar helt eller delvis osanning n r de h rs i m l r rande krogv ld
507906 det st r emellertid klart att de krogg ster som uts tts f r l gner fr n vakter samtidigt uts tts f r avsev rda risker i fr ga om r ttss kerheten i de bed mningar som domstolen har att g ra
507907 det som framkommit om r ttss kerhetsproblem n r vakter h rs i domstol r oroande det r sj lvfallet helt oacceptabelt om enskilda d ms oskyldiga p grundval av falska eller tillr ttalagda vittnesm l fr n krogvakter jag vill d rf r rekommendera rikspolisstyrelsen polismyndigheterna klagarmyndigheten och domstolsverket att verv ga vilka tg rder som kan beh va vidtas

507912 jag l rde mig tidigt av ldre kollegor hur man skulle skriva sig fri n r man beg tt vergrepp p omh ndertagna eller gripna
507913 dessa reportrar har n ra relation till de reportrar som jobbar f r en webbtidning som gs av en krogkoncern p stureplan reportrar som l ter sig mutas med bl a middagar sprit eller vip behandling p koncernens krogar
507914 det har gl mts bort att den grupp vakter som beter sig illa r en f rsvinnande liten minoritet som f r v ldigt mycket uppm rksamhet
507915 vid huvudf rhandlingen blev det pinsamt uppenbart f r mig hur vakterna h ll ihop och skapade en ber ttelse f r att motivera misshandel verv ld och kr nkande spr kbruk
507916 om jag h ll tyst och inte anm lde vakten skulle jag f g hem n r jag ist llet ville anm la det jag varit med om blev jag h nad och gripen

507919 det r ett samh llsproblem om osanningar i r tten fr n personer som r satta att uppr tth lla lag och ordning leder till att oskyldiga d ms d rf r granskar vi nu detta
507920 min h ndelse utspelade sig inte p krogen utan p en fotbollsmatch d r man anv nder sig av samma typ av ordningsvakter bevisligen
507921 att inte polisen tar promilletest i h ktet r rent r ttsvidrigt tycker jag de kan h lla folk i h kte helt utan grund f r att sedan skylla p fylla
507922 det h r till ts ske i v rt samh lle idag s fort n gon druckit vin befinner sig utan n ra v nner och bekanta omkring sig d f rsvinner all trov rdighet respekt och r ttvisa mot en hederlig medborgare vi betalar skatt f r det h r r ttsv sendet som d mer oskyldiga

507925 m dde d ligt psykiskt l nge efter detta och drar mig f r att g p krogen igen har faktiskt inte gjort det blir r dd n r jag ser vakter och arg k nns som om dom r labila anabola stinna monster som bara vill f utlopp f r sina inre aggressioner men att ge sig p f rsvarsl sa tjejer r s j vla fegt
507926 jag f r panik o b rjar skrika vansinnigt sl pp ut mig
507927 det m ste g att f lla en ordningsvakt f r misshandel om han hon gjort sig skyldig till det polisen och klagare m ste ta folk p allvar n r de blivit misshandlade av krogvakter vi kan ju inte ha ett samh lle d r personer fritt kan misshandla m nniskor utan att blir f llda f r det
507928 f rst efter ett tag slutar man sl man sl par in mig tillbaks p krogen och n r polis kommer till platsen uppger vakterna att jag hade slagit dem hotat dem och att jag varit mycket v ldsam poliserna k per hela deras l gn
507929 d puttades jag av polisen och kallades f r en juggehora jag plockade fram mitt presskort och sade att jag kommer att rapportera om detta fall och kr vde veta polisernas identitet
507930 jag fr gar vad fan de sysslar med jag m ste ju hem och ta mitt nattinsulin de drar mig in i cellen jag spj rnar mot s gott jag kan
507931 i anm lan stod det sedan att han omh ndertagits p en helt annan plats p stureplan och att han varit s full att han varit en fara f r sig sj lv och andra n got blodprov fick han inte l mna vilket man kan tycka borde vara en r ttighet man kan ju ven undra om en stupfull argumenterar f r att f l mna blodprov
507932 hela familjen blev slagen och satta i tv olika celler utan att ha r tten att g p toa utan fick kissa p golvet och sova p det familjen blev kraftigt kr nkt fr n b rjan till slut i 11 timmar
507933 han kom emot mig med h nderna och mamma gick emellan han slog henne ver munnen s kraftigt att hon ramlade omkull sedan sparkade han p henne
507934 man k nner sig maktl s de skriver att jag v grat l mna urinprov fast jag tydligt minns att inget ens bett mig om det de ljuger ihop en historia till sin f rdel
507935 tycker att det r synd att man inte kan k nna f rtroende f r s kallade tj nstem n

507993 our hitting responded today and we did what we needed to do to win i think the young kids saw what it was all about friday and they stepped up today
507994 it just wasnt meant to be the last couple of days
507995 we just couldnt get anything going and we left too many runners on base unfortunately thats the way it happened
507996 they came out aggressive and cross wasnt able to get into any kind of rhythm
507997 before we knew it they had five runs on the board and that was the game but carson is 16 years old and he has three more years left at this level along with some of the other kids this experience will be valuable down the road
507998 we played hard the whole time but sometimes you dont get the breaks
507999 we made a nice run to get here and it seemed like everything went our way just to get to the tournament we feel like we can compete with anyone but we had a couple of rough innings that got to us
508000 i think during the winning streak we just played relaxed and when we came here we were all tense and we didnt pay attention to the small things
508001 we were trying to do too much trying to tie that game with one swing of the bat

508232 my assumption is that it is iran because you wouldnt use them in iraq and i dont know where you would use them in afghanistan it doesnt have any weapons facilities underground that we know of
508233 of course we believe that the iraqi government is well informed of the importance of our bilateral relations and therefore it will not allow its country and territory to be used as an espionage base against neighboring countries
508234 theres no reason for people to think that the president is about to attack iran i think that we need to make that clear
508235 is the president aware that there is widespread fear and speculation around the country that hes going to attack iran
508236 of course he doesnt want people to fear that because what he is doing is pursuing a diplomatic track
508237 if you are ashamed of me i will be ashamed of you
508238 how is using flash to display static text for the sake of ensuring a certain type face a good idea

508240 let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
508241 let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream
508242 i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus

508247 a hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles
508248 per me stato abbastanza sconvolgente ha commentato uno dei ricercatori eric horvitz abbiamo visto che ci potrebbe essere una connessione sociale costante tra i membri dellumanit lidea che siamo molto vicini luno allaltro sempre stata molto diffusa ma abbiamo dimostrato che questa idea va oltre il folklore
508249 initial indications are that a toyota van being driven by a 47 year old woman was struck by a red honda civic car that lost control on a moderate bend
508250 two 20 year old males in the car and the woman driving the van all died in the crash

508252 with a new album of sumptuous early material just released the queen of bohemia discusses her transformation from
508253 the one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience
508254 i say that martyrs of that time excel all martyrs for martyrs hitherto have wrestled with men only but in the time of antichrist they shall battle with satan in his own person
508255 at the lords table we do not commemorate martyrs in the same way that we do others who rest in peace so as to pray for them but rather that they may pray for us that we may follow in their footsteps
508256 incline unto my aid o god o lord make haste to help me let my enemies be confounded and ashamed who seek my soul let them be turned backward and blush for shame who desire evils for me
508257 maintain good conduct among the gentiles so that in case they speak against you as wrongdoers they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day of visitation
508258 now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is right but even if you do suffer for righteousness sake you will be blessed have no fear of them nor be troubled but in your hearts reverence christ as lord always be prepared to make a defense to anyone who calls you to account for the hope that is in you yet do it with gentleness and reverence and keep your conscience clear so that when you are maligned those who revile your good behavior in christ may be put to shame for it is better to suffer for doing right if that should be gods will than for doing wrong
508259 we are not sufficient of ourselves to think anything as from ourselves but our sufficiency is from god
508260 he god also it is who has made us fit ministers of the new covenant
508261 come after me and i will cause you to become fishers of men
508262 the christian vocation is of its nature a vocation to the apostolate as well
508263 to spread the kingdom of christ over all the earth
508264 christ sent by the father is the source of the churchs whole apostolate
508265 fit to share in the inheritance of the saints in light
508266 then turning to the disciples he said privately blessed are the eyes which see what you see
508267 begins with the household of god if it begins with us how will it end for those who fail to obey the gospel of god and if the righteous one is barely saved where will the godless and sinner appear
508268 as we wait for the redemption of our bodies for in this hope we were saved
508269 helps us in our weakness for we do not know how to pray as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words
508270 able for all time to save those who draw near to god through him since he always lives to make intercession for them
508271 himself intercedes for us and intercedes for the saints according to the will of god
508272 not only to his own interests but also to the interests of others
508273 for all men for kings and all who are in high positions
508274 give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you
508275 continue steadfastly in prayer being watchful in it with thanksgiving
508276 one god the father from whom are all things and for whom we exist
508277 address one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody to the lord with all your heart
508278 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity
508279 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it

508284 bollywood hasnt really managed to generate enough business within the first two quarters of this year english films on the other hand have done well
508285 this years most widely marketed hollywood film has been hancock which was also dubbed in hindi being a comedy fantasy and starring will smith it was marketed at a scale comparable to a mainstream bollywood film
508286 generally hollywood films dont do enough business in smaller towns and cities the fact that these films are dubbed in various regional languages has also leveraged their popularity the key is to market the content right
508287 bollywood is definitely preferred to hollywood in india however over the last five years all the hollywood films put together have seen a growth of around 18 to 20 in revenue
508288 there are various pockets of the country that are apt for english films regions like south india have a big market for hollywood the north and western states are potential markets for hollywood films
508289 the reason english films are doing so well is because bollywood content is not really up to the mark this year
508290 you the men and women of naval base san diego have successfully safeguarded your people and safeguarded your resources to preserve and enhance your readiness
508291 safety is a core value taking care of yourself and your shipmates
508292 my staff takes great pride in providing the best possible customer service
508293 the accolades and accomplishments would not be possible without the support and cooperation of every person residing at the nbsd command
508294 this incident is an excellent example of the results of continued training and coordinated response of fire based emergency medical care within navy fire and emergency services
508295 all firefighters train continuously and responded to over 3 000 incidents last year enabling them to utilize their skills although the fire station atmosphere may appear casual on the surface its all business when it comes to an emergency
508296 not only did we treat more than 9 800 patients both ashore and afloat to include 270 surgeries we also had the opportunity to interact with the timorese one on one the personal interaction and friendship will stay with the people in
508297 thailand invited us in a great way we got the possibility to do this fantastic backdrop i couldnt dream of
508298 weve been able to rethink the film and maybe gain a little bit more production value
508299 i think the construction team has been able to achieve something we would have never been able to do in china
508300 everything exceeded our imagination all the movies set in shanghai in the future can shoot here
508301 we were going to follow in a lot of peoples footsteps so when we couldnt work there we suddenly in a way had a breath of fresh air we thought well we can build our own world
508302 china has a great film industry with a great history but it is hard place to integrate for a western film so we were trying to marry our system with their system and thats been a little bit easier in bangkok the systems here are a little bit more compatible
508303 the government at that moment not before or after felt it was risky for them to have another film in the same time period
508304 with greatest respect to the chinese people they chinese film officials felt that this was not the right time for them to get into this movie and we did not want to press them on it we feel theres a great future for ourselves as the producers and for the weinstein co in china so we respectfully took their decision at face value
508305 a film with gong li and with chow yun fat we really have to release it in china
508306 they made a lot of progress overnight cleaning up the debris now they are getting to some of those extremely large boulders so there will some blasting involved to get them down to size
508307 theyre too large to move with the heavy equipment onsite so we may have to blast those but we are very confident we will have the highway open sunday we cant be more specific because of the blasting
508308 the whole cleanup has been a combination of a lot of resources throwing everything they have at it
508309 once the debris is removed we can start on that it will require some repaving definitely that in itself is not a huge obstacle
508310 staff are absolutely confident they would not have gone in to remove that debris if they hadnt been 100 per cent confident of the rock face
508311 that rock face along with other areas along the corridor will continue to be monitored now that a whole lot of that rock has been released it probably makes it a little bit more safer in a perfect world wed do it in a more controlled fashion but there was nothing to suggest that a slide of this magnitude was going to happen
508312 nothing can fully prepare you for discipline problemsuntil they are experienced first hand
508313 on suggestion i do have to offer is to give some kind of training to new teachers and substitutes as well on what kind of real life situations one can expect and practical ways to deal with them i know this would have been extremely helpful for me especially that first week
508314 nothing can fully prepare you for discipline problemsuntil they are experienced first hand

508319 que es una constituci n que promueve el aborto falso totalmente falso que es una constituci n que permite la familia de homosexuales falso totalmente falso
508320 no haya denunciado que la vigente constituci n exacerbaba la competencia y el individualismo
508321 hoy est n utilizando las mismas armas los mismos instrumentos de la religi n para enga ar al pueblo ecuatoriano
508322 los trabajadores les decimos que no vamos a caer en eso y les decimos entonces que la iglesia no debe tratar en estos momentos lo que ellos llaman el problema del aborto sino que se debatan los problemas profundos de cambio y transformaci n que son los que requerimos los ecuatorianos
508323 se enmarca en la nueva constituci n que abarca 444 art culos la secci n trabajo con derechos en donde significa desplazar la pol tica neoliberal de sobre explotaci n de la clase obrera donde han impedido tener el derecho a la seguridad social a la libertad de contrataci n colectiva a la libertad de organizaci n tener un salario digno tener el derecho a fondos de reserva y a la jubilaci n

508329 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us can come together black white hispanic asian native american young old disable gay straight that i think should be our agenda all right
508330 of ignoring the plight of poor blacks targeted by predatory lenders police brutality and racist attacks

508339 truth cannot be one of your desires truth can only be there when all desires have proved to be futile and your whole energy is available and you dont know where to go because the whole life seems to be meaningless you are stuck you are tremendously frustrated you have failed and all your dreams have disappeared you are shattered to the very roots you are standing there throbbing with energy not knowing where to go then that energy becomes a pool and creates a new thirst in you the thirst to know the truth so experience the world as deeply as you can dont escape from anywhere never escape from anywhere and by and by you will be able to see the illusoriness of it the futility the meaningless repetition the boredom the dullness the death that goes on coming closer through it

508342 the existence of the record or the fact of the discharge
508343 more than three years have elapsed since the offender was discharged
508344 under the police act being of good moral character and not having a criminal record are separate criteria the facts giving rise to a conviction are therefore on their own an insufficient basis for rejecting a candidate for not being of good moral character however a pardon does not erase the past

508357 holbrooke prometeu formalmente que karadzic n o seria levado ao tribunal de haia se abandonasse definitivamente a vida p blica

508437 whenever america targets and kills innocent people it comes up with such propaganda that it has killed a big personality in an attempt to justify the cruelty it has done
508438 we have to think about affirmative action and craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more

508442 the operation is still on going successfully and is now in its fifth day
508443 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
508444 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
508445 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
508446 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
508447 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
508448 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
508449 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
508450 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
508451 we want to grow the business over a three to five year period we are executing against that plan and we are still doing that despite all the stuff thats happened to us
508452 i think they had an opportunity to get something done in the palm of their hand and they bungled it

508455 we are putting america at more risk not less risk

508546 ese equipo viene de un pa s como croacia que estuvo en la eurocopa y eso no nos debemos olvidar hemos tenido mala suerte en el sorteo ahora vamos a ver lo que significa como est n y es evidente que nosotros representamos al futbol espa ol y no debemos asustarnos de jugar sea ante alemanes en este caso croatas o ingleses
508547 para pasar la eliminatoria tememos el segundo partido fuera de casa es un peque o problema sobre todo por una afici n como la croata que aprieta mucho pero estamos ilusionados con este torneo

508552 no queremos dinero de ning n club queremos que contin e con nosotros el jugador del a o en alemania en 2007
508553 sin duda que nos da oxigeno puro vendr n dos salidas seguidas pero ahora vienen dos salidas complicad simas y hay que tener los p es sobre la tierra hay que seguir con esa humildad los jugadores se merecen un abrazo por el esfuerzo de ayer
508554 por supuesto las pagaremos primas con el gusto de siempre este tipo de premios se dan con gusto y creo que los muchachos se los merecen sin duda fue muy significativo el triunfo con diez hombres y con un equipo como el guadalajara

508608 jessica mann has written an intriguing interwoven story of a wartime evacuation and its aftermath cleverly bridging the class divide between past and present and exploiting wartime confusion to create a haunting yet dramatic whole the plot is a series of overlapping themes told from multi perspectives and from various times these shifts provide a telling testimony to the psychological effects of the second world war on a group of cornish characters

508617 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
508618 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons

508671 to be fair to nicky shorey he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
508672 we as a club have an asset and it is a delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the demands of the player and also trying to satisfy the demands of the football club
508673 we had a good talk yesterday there was a little bit of interest last week and the chances are he will be gone by next week i am 60 40 convinced that he will be gone
508674 the offer was a firm one but we have no need to sell anyone and im not going to give anyone away
508675 it has to be a realistic bid in terms of market valuation and bear in mind that 12 months ago he was coming off the back of playing two games for england against brazil and germany
508676 i dont feel disposed to let him go for nothing i appreciate it is a year on from that particular moment but as yet the valuation is not what we find acceptable

508893 well you need insulin to live but you probably have far too much insulin floating around in your body most adults have about one gallon of blood in their bodies and are quite surprised to learn that in that gallon there is only one teaspoon of sugar you only need one teaspoon of sugar at all times if that if your blood sugar level were to rise to one tablespoon of sugar you would quickly go into a hyperglycemic coma and die you body works very hard to prevent this by producing insulin to keep your blood sugar at the appropriate level this reaction keeps you from dying when you eat sugar unfortunately it turns out that high levels of insulin are quite toxic for your body anytime you eat grains and sugars you are increasing your insulin levels if you have high cholesterol high blood pressure diabetes or are overweight it is highly likely that you are eating far too many grains when i reference diabetes i am referring to the most common type type 2 diabetes which typically occurs in adulthood and is associated with increased weight type 1 diabetes is actually a problem with not enough insulin as the pancreas loses the ability to manufacture it

508924 the problem is more prevalent in the northern and western states where prosperity rapid fertility decline and patriarchal male heads the family mindsets combine to put girls at risk
508925 north india is one of the most macho places on earth sikhi is male dominated from one end to the other
508926 sikhs particularly those still living in india there is hope for sikhs in the west the younger generation practices gender equality much better than the older folks
508927 kamalla they are losing their younger generation in the west and in india too
508928 hard as it is for you to believe the fact that sikhi is so progressive theologically didnt matter when we study sikhs we have to study what they do not just what they say they ought to be doing
508929 no wrong what you say is true in some obvious western sense but i am a sikh academics need to get it through your heads that what a sikh is and what a sikh is not is defined by our scripture and only guide by the siri guru granth sahib according to the sikh guru scripture those who practice gender inequality are not true sikhs they are phoney
508930 so the majority of sikhs down through history and in present times are not really sikhs is that what you are saying
508931 that is correct they are all phoney sikhs at the level that they do not follow sikh teachings as set out in the sikh scripture but of course only god and guru can judge who is a good sikh sikh just means student as you well know
508932 sikhs dont even believe that you have to be sikh to be one of the almightys best beloveds either the sikh guru scripture reminds readers all the time that good honest loving and humble people everywhere irregardless of beliefs or culture are better sikhs than people claiming to be sikhs who fail to follow sikh teachings
508933 our gurus did their utmost to make sikh women equal partners guru amar das ji sent out sikh women to spread sikhi alas we have lost trace of those women the worst situation now is that some of the sikh women have lost their right to accept will of the creator when they are forced to abort female fetuses the sikh women need to come forward and express themselves as they did in our gurus days and become mentors to the global women

508962 i have no kind words for mac apples online service that had its identity erased and replaced with the mobileme brand on july 11 the mac service never worked quite right for me and i was looking forward to its successor
508963 mobileme offers a reduced set of services for the same 99 per year but promised microsoft exchange like synchronization for contacts e mail and events as well as snappy and modern web applications for a far better experience when away from your desktop or iphone ipod touch applications
508964 instead of a clean launch i and reportedly hundreds of thousands of mac subscribers had days of problems and even when resolved the problems left what apple describes as 1 percent of its e mail users adrift from e mail for 10 days

508987 am na p n n 2012 ceea ce e de fapt acela i lucru atac nd n contencios administrativ trasarea colegiilor uninominale
508988 ne pare rau dar nu mai exista timp sa corectam legea
508989 declararea neconstitutionalitatii legii ar conduce automat la amanarea alegerilor deorece ele nu s ar putea tine fara sa existe un act normativ care sa prevada mecanismul de desfasurare a acestora
508990 s fim bine n ele i nu v d lucrurile n alb i negru mi pare r u s dezam gesc cititorii care a teapt fie doar s laud sistemul fie doar s l critic
508991 din cate vad liderii pntcd pledeaza doar pentru o alianta cu pnl ceea ce spune multe despre nivelul lor de inteligenta politica
508992 ma refer la milut si pavelescu acesti gusa si sandru din pntcd
508993 in ce priveste pd l sigur ei n au probleme sa intre in parlament
508994 dar n as vrea sa se creada ca am iluzia ca exista un monopol al prostiei politice
508995 nu stiu daca nu cumva este prezentata ca fiind direct proportionala cu banii adunati de fiecare partid
508996 declaratia lui milut nu este ca pntcd nu se aliaza cu partide parlamentare
508997 din contra daca stirea il citeaza corect presedintele partidului spune ca singura alternativa la concurarea de unul singur in alegeri este alianta cu pnl
508998 pavelescu e prezent si in general greu de distins ca mesaj de cei doi de la pin
508999 n am sa iau la rand toate declaratiile politice ca sa le descos la capitolul prostie ar trebui sa fac asta permanent
509000 el a mai precizat c n perspectiva alegerilor parlamentare r ni tii au dou posibilit i prima este ca pn cd s se prezinte singur n alegeri iar cea de a doua este o alian cu pnl
509001 d n ii democrat liberalii n r nu au dec t varianta de fuziune pn cd nu va fuziona niciodat cu vreun partid din rom nia dec t dac pn cd este partidul care va prelua
509002 nu cred ca marian milut a fost blocat la aparitiile mediatice nu stiu sa se fi plans de asa ceva ca nu este la fel de dornic sa apara prin studiouri cum sunt altii asta e altceva
509003 deci cand spune ca au doua posibilitati se refera la o a treia
509004 eu ma refeream la altceva de fapt pntcd pare redus la acesti doi din echipa de conducere la fel cum e situatia in pin
509005 dupa stiinta mea fostii presedinti chiar unii priministrii mai ales in marea britanie si germania nu prea mai candideaza pentru o functie inferioara
509006 noul sistem avantajeaza partidele care dispun de candidati cu notorietate
509007 noul sistem avantajeaza partidele care dispun de candidati cu notorietate iar la acest capitol inclin sa cred ca psd sta mai bine
509008 in sistemul proportional pe care eu il agreez votul este politic pe platforma program national in sistemul dupa care se va vota in toamna votul va fi puternic personalizat
509009 radu votul dat din razbunare a dus la alegerea unui golan ca presedinte a unui om care a terfelit constitutia
509010 cred c b sescu o s i ating scopul va reforma clasa politic nu tiu dac direc ia reformei e cea corect
509011 or asta nu e aprioric ceva bun smecherii de la centru vor fi concurati acum de smecherii din teritoriu puterea va deveni o guma de cauciuc de care vor trage si unii si altii
509012 revin cu obsesia mea degeaba schimbam sisteme si legi daca nu educam oamenii sa devina cetateni constienti si responsabili si politicieni onesti si capabili
509013 ma gandesc in ce masura organizatiile de partid de la nivel local vor intelege ca au dobandit ceva putere in plus si vor incerca sa promoveze niste oameni din interior care sa conteste alegerile pe care le fac liderii centrali pentru anumite colegii
509014 cat despre retragerea lui iliescu de la candidatura cred ca un lucru bun pentru psd
509015 combianrea acestor mentalitati cu buletinul de vot uninominal risca sa arunce in aer bruma de coerenta a partidelor romanesti pentru ca ea e cladita pe vointa sefului nu pe negocierea membrilor
509016 pina cind acest dialog al membrilor partidului nu va aparea nu va exista consensul care sa refaca unitatea doctrinara
509017 haide sa nu schimbam sisteme si legi haide sa facem educatie civica
509018 politicienii pur s nge cum se cred victor ponta sau vlad hogea s au repezit s le dea la cap celor doi nou veni i principala acuza ie am ndoi au simulat independen a ca jurnali ti pentru a induce opinia public n eroare acuza ia e formulat dup ureche fiindc incrimina ii au statut de invita i la ziarele n care scriu
509019 politicianul rom n pur s nge fa cu voinescu i avramescu
509020 realitatea este ca cei doi si altii ca ei iau locuri pe care
509021 este aceeasi critica adusa partidelor istorice si gds in 1990
509022 chiar crede catalin avramescu ca are solutia cistigatoare pentru a l contracara pe adrian nastase in fata unor oameni care asteapta sa
509023 nu candidam impotriva lui x pentru ca oricum castiga ca urmare x castiga oricum pentru ca n a candidat nimeni impotriva lui
509024 n are sens ca oameni noi sa intre in politica pentru ca nu s mai capabili politic decat cei vechi prin urmare dovedim ca oamenii vechi sunt capabili politic pentru ca numai ei au candidat
509025 laudabil gestul acestor oameni de a iesi la lumina si a sustine pe fata ceea ce afirmau de sub masca
509026 in cel priveste pe avramescu cred ca doar orgoliul si dorinta de faima l a indemmnat sa candideze impotriva lui nastase
509027 doc argumentatia ta merge desi are un usor iz de admiratie
509028 cat despre problemele pe care le au asta este daca isi inchipuie cumva ca vor face o plimbare pana in parlament o sa aiba o surpriza neplacuta
509029 dl avramescu e singurul care a decis s fac ceva mai mult dec t s l critice
509030 realitatea este ca cei doi ar fi incintati sa candideze chiar daca infringerea e certa ca le da bine la cv
509031 nu in cvul celor doi ar da bine un esec electoral
509032 ma intreb doar pe ce anume se bazeaza cind cred ca vor fi mai buni decit membrii vechi ai pdl din colegiu sau nu
509033 din felul cum iti inchei articolul am o banuiala ca si tu ai de gand sa candidezi pe undeva doc
509034 hai ba ca ti am gasit un colegiu la constanta
509035 dle damian avem o deschidere pentru societatea civila la botosani
509036 social democratia are nevoie de tine dragul meu in mehedinti
509037 faptul ca devine om politic nu ii delegitimeaza dar nici nu ii legitimeaza retroactiv critica din perioada in care era jurnalist
509038 a aduce ca argument faptul ca astia 2 au avut statut de invitati permanenti si aproape zilnic daca bine am observat la cotidianul si deci nu au mintit poporul cu tastatura nefiind ziaristi recte independenti e un mic sofism iar daca nu este un sofism pune intr o lumina foarte proasta cotidianul
509039 este vorba de argumentul ca politica este pentru profesionisti nu pentru scirta scirta pe hirtie si alti
509040 intrebare inteleg ca viitorii candidati ar trebui sa plateasca sau sa faca un colateral pentru candidatura doar un fel de garantie spune noua lege electorala asa ceva si ce nr are legea asta
509041 2 nu sint functionar public deci nu am probleme legale de incompatibilitate
509042 nu pentru ca ar fi incompatibil legal sau chiar moral nu e nici una si nici cealalta ci pentru ca nu e gestul unui candidat serios as fi vrut sa scriu ca singurul mod in care poate fi prezent prea mult in colegiul sau este daca e vazut acolo permanent in conditiile date orice absenta de acolo e un minus pentru succesul in alegeri
509043 4 nu a inceput campania doar au fost anuntate candidaturile cind va incepe oficial am sa vad ce am sa fac probabil am sa imi iau concediu de la administratia prezidentiala dar sint gata sa fac campanie si dupa amiaza in weekend si in timpul liber dupa cum sugerezi pentru ca nu am de gind sa ma transform in candidat de profesie pentru ca nu cred in politicieni de profesie
509044 5 in general eu sint pentru o separare radicala intre candidati si demnitari oficiali daca am sa ajung in senat unul din primele lucruri pe care am sa le fac va fi sa propun o masura de interzicere a mandatelor consecutive
509045 7 am vazut diverse comentarii legate de nastase si mizil din cite stiu a n nu a declarat niciodata direct ca va candida acolo asa ca orice interventie pe tema asta este cu necesitate o simpla speculatie

509070 women make up 16 percent of the congress 16 percent of the top corporate positions and 16 percent of the lower houses of parliaments worldwide these are record numbers for the united states but they are low compared to many other countries the united states ranks sixty ninth in a list of 187 countries in the percentage of women in lower houses of parliament

509073 buncarul s a cutremurat usor apoi a aparut pe neasteptate o lumina orbitoare urmata de un nor de fum
509074 oficialii mi au spus ca trebuie sa ramanem in buncar pentru cateva ore din cauza efectelor exploziei dupa ce am plecat ne am imbracat intr un combinezon care mi a parut din azbest si am mers la locul exploziei circa un kilometru si jumatate distanta efectele erau tragice copacii din jur fusesera carbonizati nimic viu in acea zona erau cateva animale oi din care ramasese doar cenusa

509083 i had a whole lot less tolerance for the gifted and a whole lot more tolerance for the guy that wasnt quite as gifted
509084 with johnny i saw him struggle to walk struggle to kick a ball struggle to do everything that he did so i had a little tolerance for the guys that had to struggle if you had talent and didnt lay it on the line i didnt have much tolerance for you the less talented guy cant play on saturdays but he can get you ready to play on saturdays i wanted the guys who played on saturday to have an appreciation for that guy who got them there

509096 this will be the last one you have to feel
509097 sorry i think youre gonna lose this bet i dont think hell be here within a half hour
509098 illegal entry of spare parts from neighbouring states has been affecting purchase sale transactions of our registered dealers here
509099 it has been seen in the past that vat rate cuts by neighbouring states always result in lower sales turnover for those commodities in jharkhand leading to a revenue loss to the state exchequer
509100 according to about a dozen wal mart employees who attended such meetings in seven states wal mart executives claim that employees at unionized stores would have to pay hefty union dues while getting nothing in return and may have to go on strike without compensation also unionization could mean fewer jobs as labor costs rise
509101 voting for democratic presidential hopeful sen barack obama would be tantamount to inviting unions in
509102 hope interrogators find out what his motivations were and who influenced him
509103 americans kept asking me why i did it but there was no why
509104 we scored a magnificent goal through urby but we were a little bit lucky
509105 we had a lot of problems with the ivory coast and were losing the ball too much we could have lost this game
509106 if we had converted our chances we could have won tonight
509107 were very happy with this week as weve come through two matches played at a high level
509108 im very confident in my players now as we now focus on the olympics
509109 i was always a protective mum but now i cant let my daughter walk down a different aisle when we are shopping and i have panic attacks
509110 im glad hes not in napier but hes a ticking time bomb and should be locked up
509111 the system failed me and my daughter they not only let me down they put my daughter at risk which is unacceptable
509112 he was supposed to be under 24 hour supervision and was to have two trackers if he left the property
509113 yet he was able to jump the fence into my property and stalk my five year old daughter for 10 days
509114 it was only because i am a protective mum anyway that i found out who he was before something happened
509115 when i did find out who he was and what he had done i hit the roof
509116 a very high proportion of the people who have that on their title wont realise the consequences a majority probably
509117 and of course they say we never knew that and each time of course its too late we try to provide the information but of course we dont know about the situation until we get a claim
509118 it is almost the opposite situation now where local authorities are declining applications to build and potentially facing legal action from developers
509119 it just gets put on the title and theres no further information given
509120 the clubhouse allows me to just be creative with my ideas
509121 what i like about the club is that i get to write and record my own songs
509122 the goals of the teen summit are to inspire computer clubhouse youth not only to build hands on fluency in technology but also to become self motivated confident learners through collaborative experiences that spark their interest expand life skills and help them become global citizens
509123 to qualify for a tick simply by changing the serving size recommendation i think is just not consistent with the principle of the tick i mean you could in an extreme situation say ill have half a piece of this chocolate bar instead of a whole chocolate bar and it meets the tick the pick the tick programme is trying to get manufacturers to reformulate and produce foods that have less salt and less energy and less saturated fat and thats good but in this food product it just doesnt exist
509124 there clearly is a downside when its consumed in too large an amount but its the real world and i think its better that we make the recommendation in a positive way and educate people about the benefits of this product with trim milk as a healthy milk drink
509125 were trying to be responsible in terms of the whole obesity environment
509126 people are going to continue dosing probably at their normal dosage rate and the research shows that is under three teaspoons so if theyre dosing at that rate it shows theyre qualifying for the heart tick
509127 because it speaks symbolically to what is important to national that new zealanders get to keep more of what they earn that they face better incentives and that ultimately we believe in a smaller state and less intrusion in their lives
509128 thats a programme we want rolled out straight away we remain deeply concerned about the one in five new zealanders that we see leaving school with inadequate literacy and numeracy skills
509129 we have made some clear choices and you will see that when you see our tax cut programme
509130 the main aspect of policy is going to be around infrastructure
509131 while we wouldnt borrow for tax cuts were not opposed to borrowing for infrastructure
509132 new zealand doesnt have a debt problem it has a growth problem
509133 it will be tangible evidence that were serious about what we want
509134 were not averse to the private sector playing a role in a number of areas and driving productivity for us
509135 thats our aim over time its two fold firstly clearly tax has some initial implications but we all understand the limitations of the tax system
509136 but secondly if we can drive productivity over time we can drive higher wages if you really want to lift wages weve got to equip new zealanders with the skills to take on jobs which are more productive we need to give them the environment that will allow us to grow
509137 i dont think there really ever is in terms of economic performance
509138 our argument really is about wanting to make an economic step change which captures the huge growth opportunities that sit in the medium to long term in new zealand its about preparing the economy
509139 i do think that notwithstanding the economic slowdown at the moment the global economy will double in the next 25 years it will be driven out of asia and it will be hitting the sweet spot of what new zealand has the potential to play a really key role in that is production of food tourism and ultimately niche type industries which are service based or technology based
509140 medical condition and the difficulties he was encountering in prison
509141 in other words if you eat yourself up to 200kgs in weight you can do anything you like and you dont have to go to prison that is not on
509142 the first time was a few years back and someone got a birth certificate of his and went on the dole for three years at his expense
509143 the first time with the benefit fraud my wife was absolutely horrified with the second one she was a mess she had health problems and she just went down and down and down
509144 im utterly disgusted for the simple reason that we thought in febuary now we can get over this
509145 its been hanging over our heads for three years and now were back to square one
509146 we came to that view in view of his medical condition and the difficulties he was encountering in prison
509147 however we noted this does not detract from the fact that he has a considerable and long record of fraudulent behaviour
509148 in the end his medical condition at the moment is such that the board cannot confidently decline his parole on the basis that he is an undue risk to the community
509149 we think his activities might well be restricted by virtue of his medical condition
509150 negotiating my way around unfamiliar places became hazardous ordinary day to day activities became impossible without some form of assistance
509151 these numbers whose future could be eventual blindness are too great with proper treatment a reasonable quality of life could be maintained
509152 shouldnt we be doing the same as them in giving the best treatment and the proven treatment
509153 we are aware of attempts by major pelly to seek compensation from the nzdf through legal processes involving a woman in wanganui
509154 because it is going through legal paths there is not a lot we can say about the matter
509155 pacific sun will stay in auckland until at least the morning to provide passengers with a more comfortable voyage following a further deterioration in the weather
509156 its been a nightmare since wednesday today is my sons 14th birthday and we were supposed to be on the sea but now we are having his birthday on a ship in auckland harbour
509157 we tried to go on the cruise ship in 2007 but they totally cancelled that one because the ship was previously damaged so this is our second one and we still havent got away yet
509158 i join the people of guam in mourning the deaths of sgt brian leon guerrero and spc samson mora who were fatally injured in afghanistan
509159 it looks like just a flash in the pan job
509160 it was loud it was so loud it really made me jump
509161 so we got up to check the power box there was no light out there it was really dark but my partner saw someone slumped against our fence and he told me to go and grab a torch and the phone to ring the police
509162 initially the man was still alive and i told my partner to give him cpr but then he saw the shotgun and the police said to stay away
509163 we didnt realise there was another person who was already dead it was so dark but then one of the police lights shone over her and we saw that there was a lady lying on the ground covered in blood
509164 now that equity markets have tanked should i move my money to fixed income investments
509165 with a 50 bps hike in repo and 25 bps hike in crr some may call it a case of an overkill but it is visible that there is an urgency in the policymakers to aggressively rein in money supply and inflation before the impending general elections arrive
509166 the magnitude of the rate hike has surprised the market this will push up rates both at the short and the long end of the yield curve
509167 the sensex is likely to break below the 13 000 level in the near future after a relief rally from lows we are heading back to test earlier lows and possibly make new ones this is typical of a bearish phase any excuse will result in a sell off in equities a fall in global equities un abating inflation or crude resuming its up move
509168 this is also a good time to negotiate pre payment and get some good rates with banks they will be more than ready to do so at the moment
509169 banks dont want to carry delinquencies on their books at the moment and will be ready to come to the table
509170 the equity market will always give you a return that is a bit more than the inflation rate plus the economy growth rate over four to five years
509171 inflation in india is likely to hover around 12 till the third quarter of fy09 with possible earnings downgrades too we see the indices falling further
509172 we remain negative on interest rate sensitives banks autos and real estate
509173 the fmcg sector continues to vigorously stroke ahead while economic and political waves flagellate virtually all other sectors there has yet been no evidence of consumption slowdown even as other sectors flail their arms about which is exactly why the sector continues to demand a defensive premium today
509174 we expect a tightening bias will remain in policy in the near term and now expect a hike of 25 basis points in the repo rate and the crr respectively by end october we think however that rates will start easing from q1 2009 as inflation begins to come off
509175 considering the market conditions and the governments need for raising funds the pricing is expected to be very attractive this time around and i would recommend investors and portfolio managers to keep cash aside for such opportunities
509176 were getting a lot of work done trying to button up the things we need to improve upon and just taking it deeper into the system
509177 you come out every day and work hard do some more work and then wake up the next day and do even more work
509178 were getting everything done and installed that we need to so i think were right on schedule
509179 training camp is going well and has exceeded my expectations
509180 the guys are great the team is great and the chemistry is right where it needs to be its exciting
509181 its been fun getting out there everyday getting better at it working at it devoting my skills and technique at it
509182 they minorities are prepared to defend the country against any external attacks as they did so during the 1980 1988 sacred defense
509183 it is deplorable that previous u s assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of u s activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
509184 use of for and drop the lt gt if you have only one parameter
509185 if i have questions about es4 spec where can i ask for help
509186 the part that is good is not original and the part that is original is not good
509187 use the canonical source but dont let my web page appear in the referer field in the logs
509188 my code is designed to work with libfoo 1 4 2

509190 i wasnt calling shared without src a bug i was wondering if it would be a way to check whether a script isnt in the cache
509191 probably not what the author intended but the browser must carry on as before
509192 second browsers can cache by hash code if the cache contains a file that matches the requested hash then there is no need to go to the network regardless of the url
509193 chrome ui code must sanitize content data that flows into it
509194 why should i ever leave mozilla with xulrunner as the engine it ought to be possible to make the windows interface itself one more object rendered by gecko with all of the xul css and javascript goodness inherent
509195 ok lets use speculative lock elision or stm instead of fine grained spinlocks but condvars or monitors elsewhere
509196 a sub group of tg1 is investigating possibly standardizing a smaller compatible language but this proposal has not yet been adopted
509197 why it was decided that it is worth transforming it into a language that does address programming in the large
509198 losing backward compatibility both hurts migration and bloats browsers with two engines
509199 browsers not bundled with operating systems therefore downloaded voluntarily by users cannot afford two engines even more to the point browsers targeting phones and other small devices cannot afford two engines and there is no need for two engines since es4 is a superset of es3
509200 simplicity is one of the most misunderstood concepts in programming people who design languages frequently want to keep those languages simple and clean while the sentiment is noble doing this can make programs written in that language more complex
509201 to prove this ill make a promise if microsoft truly embraces es4 and ships it in an ie beta ill put screamingmonkey on hiatus
509202 pl pratap lakshman microsoft we do not support or agree to the current es4 proposal either in whole or in part we intend to continue to work with interested tg members to develop a proposal for a more incremental revision of the current specification
509203 demo of readonly behavior i dont like this at all but if its going to be like this shouldnt the attempted assignment throw an error
509204 python lets you do class classa classa and classa 1 for that matter
509205 how are you supposed to run this interactively what if you make a mistake with a class
509206 so i cant even remove redefine my own classes which will always be dynamic why would i want them to be otherwise this seems an enormous step backwards what happens if i have a page which is open 24 7 and that needs to load in javascript from somewhere else dynamically
509207 but not a total disaster id even argue its the right behaviour here
509208 nooooooo now when i use other peoples typed libraries i have to conform to their official class hierarchy style which is often idiosyncratic or bitrotted etc e g
509209 ok that was obvious but the error is non existent rather than privacy violation so i cant even tell that the class actually has x and y as private properties
509210 im hoping these are bugs or that ive misunderstood the syntax for the wrap operator
509211 still because i havent implemented the set function in mypointclass im guessing it wont work anyway even though it quacks like a duck for this particular function
509212 if i encounter too many people using classes interfaces and types in ways that i have to deal with then es4 is not in practice at all like the es3 i love
509213 all the restrictions on mutations etc also seem to be the antithesis to the idea of an open web
509214 but again we have to be backward compatible this is a real issue because the built in classes date etc are bound to readonly properties of the global object in es4
509215 python does not have an optional type checker also remember the json issues that joe walker brought to light where object and array can be hijacked
509216 this is a repl read eval print loop you start over issue the reboot command or use a new name
509217 finally if you really want a different binding for the new class use a new name which can be done using namespace prefixing so that the classs simple name is the same
509218 then use like and structural types they stand ready type datelike like getfullyear function double function fun2 d datelike return d getfullyear fun2 new date fun2 mycustomobject 0 getfullyear function return 2008 the reference implementation is behind the overview here but you get the idea
509219 the web is too big for one true way but the cream will float to the top
509220 sorry open web like open mind and open mouth has to close some times
509221 i guess it depends on why an end developer has overwritten the built in class if its to supply an enhanced definition then silent failure might work with warnings on stderr or in an error console but if its to un intentionally implement something conceptually different to the built in class then exceptions are best since the code would be completely broken anyway potentially in dangerous ways
509222 still wouldnt it be a nicer upgrade experience from es3 gt es4 gt es5 and beyond if the code simply overwrote new built ins like int decimal double vector etc
509223 wouldnt access controls for cookies also make it possible to allow any cross site scripting without any security concerns except for ddos since the data available would then be the same as that available from server side php etc
509224 in any event object prototype can still be extended isnt this still a security issue when combined with the cookie problem e g i can type this into firebug
509225 reboot doesnt seem to work in the ri e g my classa is still defined
509226 perhaps there are ways around it with namespaces but if the code in plotfuncs js lives in say the plotfuncs namespace then ill have to use a new namespace for each change in plotfuncs js
509227 i cant tell how this would work right now as packages dont seem to work in the ri
509228 problem is sometimes its just more convenient for me or others to use an already written class like date in the type specification rather then thinking about exactly which methods or method signatures and properties your functions arguments should accept with the availability of types its tempting to write function fun2 d date instead of function fun2 d but not very tempting at all to write function fun2 d datelike datelike spec this problem is mitigated somewhat by the fact that es4 still allows you to rewrite function definitions also if your dealing with your own code theres no problems as you can just rewrite the original definition with the more general type when you realise you need to
509229 like and wrap are certainly very attractive theyre one of the things i like about es4
509230 i reiterate my belief and to admit a bias my hope that security is an environment level concern not a language level concern despite the existence of terrorism we still speak english not newspeak ok so thats slightly too loose an analogy and in the case of cookies i think it can be handled with something like the access control proposal at the w3
509231 in both cases it took about 300 years to sort the matter out so dont expect any early or easy resolution
509232 sei o que um ataque com kak pato seedorf e inzaghi pode oferecer estou curioso para ver o desempenho do trio kak ronaldinho pato acredito que eles ir o bem

509240 the antenna stands about 8 feet high and straddles the width of the runway
509241 we have witness accounts that it did touch down and the pilot was trying to land and during the landing roll out for some reason they made a decision to try to take off and get airborne again
509242 the airplane was still on the ground when it hit that antenna and the accident sequence began at that point and the plane ended up in that cornfield
509243 we are looking at all aspects of the flight not just focusing on any one thing
509244 honeywell will take the box to one of their laboratories and determine whether or not it has any memory trace or trail in it that we can use

509254 okay badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
509255 i never knew tim and his family but i wish all the best in this awful time
509256 as of right now weve seen little to no impact on ticket sales and intercity bus travel continues to be a safe way to travel
509257 they are taught to immediately pull over the bus and call the authorities
509258 i did pretty good i think i beat one guy by an inch or something like that
509259 im trying to make myself better than i was last year thats all
509260 its good to help kids like keep their head on straight gang bangin like it aint what it is
509261 so the kids can kind of get a feel of the different events that go on during the track the olympic games

509536 good evening everyone work and family issues have kept me away for the last seven weeks i work in the insurance industry in downtown boston people are staying off the roads in droves thanks to high energy prices and our business is down 40 percent from last year since my company has not chosen to diversify its geographic base and since im the newest employee in my department and both single and childless im out of a job as you might imagine im more than a little annoyed thank god i refinanced my mortgage before the rates climbed i left a stable albeit lower paying job early this year to take the position in boston im eligible for unemployment benefits i got a decent severance package and my company has informed me im eligible for rehire in other words you can officially mark me down as an obamacon or obamalican or whatever you call those of us on the republican side who are fed up with bush and the current republican party and who will support the democratic nominee this november while i admired senator obamas clinton slaying prowess and respected his skills as an orator and politician i had no serious plans to vote for him but things have become worse in the last two months for both myself and the country as a whole yeah i dont agree with barack obama on the iraq war or on 65 70 percent of his policy positions but somethings got to give as much as i respect senator mccain he just doesnt get it john mccains idiotic attacks on obamas patriotism taken together with his reversals of his previous and admirable positions on major issues the bush tax cuts offshore drilling etc and his willingness to associate with pond scum like karl rove and company have pushed me out of his camp

509542 i got the idea last year while shopping for a sympathy card with my wife
509543 i asked my wife why she was buying two cards when we only needed one and she explained to me that she did not know what to write inside of her card of choice so she was going to hand write the message from one card into the other i decided that evening to do a google search for sympathy card messages and discovered that i could only find floral shops offering some sympathy messages but no site specifically dedicated to providing various types of greeting card messages
509544 many people have busy lifestyles and demanding responsibilities that take up a lot of their time but this does not have to be a reason to neglect showing someone what they truly mean to you regardless of whether you need a creative card message words of comfort for a sympathy card thank you note examples graduation or other congratulation messages or even if you are looking for holiday christmas poems giftcardmessages com has it all although there are countless choices of greeting and e card services often the messages are ineffective impersonal and or inappropriate there are other sites that offer personalized greeting cards however many users lack the creativeness to materialize their feelings into effective verses giftcardmessages com seeks to alleviate unnecessary frustration by providing just the right words to communicate that special message for any occasion

509608 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war

509610 dont get smart you two are in a heap of trouble

509656 i believe i think too much i believe i am literally drowning in a thick swamp of thoughts no swamps not right its more like being in the middle of a swarm of bees all of them flying insanely about occasionally stinging for no apparant reason i also believe my perception of the world is filtered through my thoughts which are generated by my emotions which are cranked out by my childhood what i just ate how much sleep i got miscellaneous traumas stored as memories etc this means that with few exceptions what i perceive is not reality but the crap that comes after my thought emotion filter ya dig where im going here my only links to reality are these constantly buzzing mental bees that grow out of a snarling hive of random emotions in fact i believe that this is the flimsy connection we all have with the universe it makes you think doesnt it ouch dammit
509657 i hate the way you talk to me and the way you cut your hair i hate the way you drive my car i hate it when you stare i hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind i hate you so much it makes me sick it even makes me rhyme i hate the way youre always right i hate it when you lie i hate it when you make me laugh even worse when you make me cry i hate it that youre not around and the fact that you didnt call but mostly i hate the way i dont hate you not even close not even a little bit not even at all
509658 but justine you didnt write this its not even a song for christs sake its out of a fucking chick movie

509680 zoriah is a real photographer thank you zoriah for showing us the truth
509681 your work is beyond words almost to point of emotional breakpoint
509682 a riveting unflinching set of some of the most poignant photography ive ever come across
509683 tus fotos son increibles impactantes el tratado de blanco y negro es fenomenal me quito el sombrero ya me gustar a a mi poder hacer trabajos de ese tipo
509684 you have some outstanding work i checked your site and i understand why you have won awards you really cover your subject matter with an expert eye very inspiring and eye opening i will check back often
509685 muito muito muito com o seu trabalho meus sinceros parabens fico feliz em ver fotografos engajados com a luta dos povos beijos e fortes abra os solid rios
509686 this is stunning you have a rare ability to find sensitive moments in some very insensitive situations what a talent
509687 incredible not just because they are excellent photographs but because they are frighteningly honest i hope you continue to make these strong thought provoking records and that you stay safe in what must be incredibly difficult situations both physically and emotionally
509688 it would be somewhat of an understatement to say i was impressed with your work we obviously know how dangerous it is to be involved in that theater iraq im sure that every moment of every day is just on the verge of chaotic for what is that war war if not the ultimate of chaos and yet you have these moments where you pause to compose image of graphic quality equal to content admire all you compositional skills but am especially taken by the wideangle work do your best to do so and know youre held in high esteem
509689 i have to confess that i couldnt sleep properly after seeing your photos the first time these images are still in my mind and wont let me go
509690 there is a great passion in every single shot and im very impressed sad shocked touched deeply moved frightened and inspired in the same way you are documenting a very important episode of history your pictures speak for themselves and your work is beyond words your work is not easy as it is difficult to photograph people in distress however it concerns us all and we shall not forget
509691 into the very depths of my soul i cannot begin to even sum up with words the depths of how your images reach out to me it brings me down to earth and reminds me as to why i picked up the camera in the first place your works are truly inspiring youre very privileged to have to see these places with your own eyes observe and capture through your lens the true state of the world we live in as for now for me itll have to be through your eyes your pictures and the stories they tell truly honored
509692 there is a hunger to know the truth about war and your accurate presentation of it is exemplary i dont believe it possible to be unmoved by your images this is especially true for those of us who live in a very different world essentially free from the suffering and carnage you portray thank you for your dedication and courage you are making and incredible contribution to world understanding hopefully not at an extreme cost to yourself war photography seems like a hard way to make a living on many levels living and breathing civilian trauma is not easy but it is more localized you can get away from it by driving or moving to another location but with war there is no escape the reality is so harsh and overwhelmingly pervasive into all areas of life stay safe many will be following you
509693 thanks zoriah for your hard work and incredible vision and for the inspiration your example lends to others who have put down the gun or never carried one
509694 all i can say its very very impressive keep up the good work the world must know

509696 your images are so profound they have so much depth and feeling attached to them i have much admiration for those who are willing to risk their own safety in order to capture images such as the ones you do
509697 after watching your pics i m absolutely tired exhausted sooooo much information inside them one day i will make pictures like yours but it will take me three or four lives to learn to do it not great but incredible work thanks for showing us all the way master
509698 i feel honored after i have seen your great work one day maybe with more time i hope i will also be able to take the picture i like going to those place where a photographer contribute can be of a help to improve the quality of life of all those people suffering thank you again

509701 thank you your work is amazing photojournalism is my most desired form of photography the stories emotions and sights your photographs bring to their audience are moving maddening touching frightening all the things good photojournalism does rock on

509712 i find these kinds of life photos as heartbreaking as those which vulgarly show death and destruction such good capture it tells a whole story
509713 tus fotos son increibles impactantes el tratado de blanco y negro es fenomenal me quito el sombrero ya me gustar a a mi poder hacer trabajos de ese tipo
509714 superb photojournalistic images you have in your gallery compels me to comment on almost each one let them speak for themselves because they really dont need comments they yet deserve to be deeply appreciated for all their quality hope to see more of your fantastic work soon
509715 ive often tried to express this practice but a photo is worth more than my words
509716 ive always thought that photographs are a kind of self portrait of the photographer
509717 your work is amazingly powerful some hard to look at but gripping nonetheless
509718 ive seen many war photos and met a few war photographers but zoriahs work deeply touched me
509719 simply excelent its a great reportage of a difficult situation
509720 deserves to take a well earned place in history in the company of phillip jones griffith don mc cullen larry burrows and robert capa the minimal presentation of his work is perfect the viewer fills in the details and the images linger stubbornly in the memory to awake one from sleep in a cold sweat these images cannot be taken in in one viewing the viewer returns restlessly again and again attempting to process the information this is really happening iconic compelling images of war by a true professional i take my hat off to him
509721 a chilling commentary on the madness of war all war
509722 the worlds cruelty compressed into some thousand pixels its so impressive
509723 right up there with robert capa wonderful work you should be with magnum you are showing all sides of the conflict
509724 what you are doing is so so important i cannot even contemplate what horror and pain you have seen but see it we must true dedication and bravery is the only way to expose such inhumanity keep truth as your motto and maybe this silly world we live in will someday wake up and treat people as living souls not simply pieces of meat to be traded in worthless pointless conflicts i salute you sir
509725 his commitment to photojournalism can not be denied i am certain he will secure a place amongst some of our best
509726 i am awed by these images some rank among the best millitary images ive ever seen and ive collected all the greats
509727 i am in awe i really dont know what to say i havent been this affected since i saw nachtweys work
509728 it is a eye opener to view your work it brings strong emotions when doing so your work reflects another side of the world around us and beyond i will use it to find inspiration for myself thanks for sharing these pictures with us
509729 amazing difficult to stomach i am very emotional but just brilliant and captivating thanks for sharing all your photos

509766 the substance in the syringe is an herbal extract that i mix myself it suppresses certain physiological responses

509787 the warm welcome for tides was a pleasant surprise for us
509788 we got good radio airplay in finland even climbed to the charts all before our very first gig with our own material since then weve played throughout finland at clubs and festivals our music has been described as melodic metal or melodic heavy rock which is fine by us
509789 we wanted to plan the second album and the second step of our career carefully the songs were all written between the release of tides and entering the studio in july 2007 right from the first demos we knew that the second album will be a great step forward for leverage heres why were tighter as a band we know what our own style is and what we might be capable of and were busting our butts to make as solid music as we ever can we recorded and mixed torsti spoof and jari mikkola the album at studio audio jyv skyl finland between the beginning of july and halfway of september it was mastered at chartmakers helsinki
509790 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
509791 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
509792 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
509793 the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use
509794 you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems
509795 this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is either for political or judicial reasons a push toward decriminalization of personal possession sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers
509796 it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses
509797 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
509798 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
509799 this is the blue floating thing that i was telling you about
509800 sam i dont even want to think about us living here
509801 i hope you guys are ready for some hot stuff fire
509802 i hope you guys are ready for some rough trouble earth

509808 it is observed that adding adsense to a new website in the first few weeks of propagation will flag the website to google and will expedite the sandbox effect and elongate the process where its pagerank moves from a solid bar to pr 0 or more depending on its link popularity

509856 you dont realize hes just a kid hes 18 years old martin said this last month just a few days before cassills 19th birthday very impressive young man and hes shown some great progress in the last three or four races i think if rick hendrick gets him some regular seat time instead of irregular seat time he certainly has potential to be a cup driver
509857 when i get home i want to chill i dont want a lot of racket going on
509858 i was looking to downsize from a townhouse and i had seen a lot of the apartments in laurel since i knew the area pretty well they all looked the same
509859 i saw the sign off 197 and i never realized they were apartments a friend and i went together and we went wow it is just so attractive
509860 i couldnt believe you were getting the same apartment for this price

509869 the fact that they are breathing healthier air is not something weve gone in depth with
509870 i can relax without having something fall down on my head
509871 any time you have a bit of hysteria that creates uncertainty and people dont like to make a major purchase like a house if their finances are borderline
509872 these frustrated sellers i guess said to themselves ill just rent this property until the market is better and as a result it impacted the for rent market by all of a sudden crowding the market with a lot of for rent product
509873 with a valid lease you wouldnt have a problem one way or the other from an apartment manager or an individual

509918 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children

509947 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
509948 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall

509954 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
509955 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
509956 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
509957 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
509958 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
509959 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
509960 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
509961 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
509962 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
509963 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
509964 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
509965 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
509966 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
509967 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
509968 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
509969 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars i will however compare our two visions for our economic future

509974 behold your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you
509975 behold my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of god he is my brother and sister and mother
509976 where did this man get these things and what is this wisdom given to him and such miracles as these performed by his hands is this not the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon are not his sisteres here with us
509977 your mother and your brothers are standing outside wishing to see you

509986 very few people look the part and are it too
509987 im voting for john mccain because even though im struggling to get by financially i want rich people to get lots of tax breaks while i settle for a bullshit gas tax holiday that might save me 20 a year and mostly just helps oil companies pad their all time record profits
509988 im voting for senator mccain because even though he was wrong about going to war in iraq and wrong about how wed be welcomed as liberators and wrong about how well the sunnis and shiites would get along after saddams regime fell and wrong about irans links to al qaida and wrong about how safe it is to walk around in an open air market without a huge security detail and wrong about whether iraq and afghanistan share a border at least he was kind of half right about the surge
509989 i support john mccain because i enjoy being underpaid underinsured and treated like crap at my job at wal mart and i sure wouldnt want to have access to any union protection clearly if wal mart hates the idea of unions so much they must be bad
509990 im voting for mccain because im still enamored with the energy policies of the past the kind that rely on nonrenewable fossil fuels drive the unsustainable expansion of suburban sprawl discourage the development of viable mass transit systems and speed the global warming that will eventually make my state an uninhabitable wasteland lets drill drill drill
509991 ill vote for john mccain this november because i really thought his ads comparing obama to britney spears and moses were funny and i admire his outright lies about everything from his voting record to obamas recent overseas trip thats the kind of integrity and maturity we need in a leader
509992 im voting for mccain because even though hes supported the vast majority of george bushs agenda and in the last 12 months has changed positions on just about every matter of substance in a shameless attempt to kiss up to the conservative elements of his party im still buying into the outdated and completely false media characterization of mccain as a maverick willing to work across party lines and do whats right whether its popular or not
509993 im a mccain supporter because i dont really care if america starts wars willy nilly fails to provide its citizens with adequate health care or education tortures people it doesnt like strips its citizens of civil liberties and allows most of the power to accumulate with the 1 percent of people who are rich and powerful enough to buy influence all i care about is finding ways to impose my religious beliefs about gay people on everybody else
509994 im voting for john mccain because im a goddamn idiot
