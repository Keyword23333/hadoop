3570233 oh i dont work in that department youll just need to hang out at that desk and wait for someone to show up
3570234 i know we are supposed to have those in stock but i dont know where they are
3570235 ht has been a godsend for our extremely hyper but lovable portuguese water dog miya
3570236 im from out of town im slightly buzzed on sake and i want to make conversation in this hotel airport bar
3570237 these photos of pieces montees look great but do you suppose he could put less of the hairy spun caramel on
3570238 and does he have any flavours other than vanilla for the cream could he also put some berries on the base i also like the idea of crystallised violets sprinkled around the whole thing
3570239 miss the chef will decide how to prepare the cake now would you like to order or not
3570240 this is the kick in the butt i needed to crank out a film every 4 months
3570241 the roar of the greasepaint the smell of the crowd
3570242 i was outraged but i didnt know if we would win but we did win
3570243 we could not have done it without the effort of all
3570244 we might not win but we were going to fight
3570245 what really disturbed me out of all this was the fact that some of these city agencies who are there to protect our interests were almost implicit in siting these facilities in the middle of our neighborhood
3570246 they need to bring their boxing gloves and take out a second mortgage because when they come here they are going to have a fight and we are going to get into their pockets
3570247 estoy encantado y feliz con la plantilla que me ha dado la directiva
3570248 en el mundo del f tbol nunca puedes decir que una plantilla est cerrada no puedes precipitarte
3570249 mientras aporte algo nuevo y cosas ser bienvenido si consideran que es necesario que lo fichen
3570250 hay una ficha vacante en la plantilla y si llega otro defensa habr m s competencia y m s competitividad
3570251 partimos de cero esta temporada y tenemos las mismas posibilidades
3570252 existe una vacante en la plantilla y los t cnicos piensan que debe reforzarse
3570253 la principal raz n de mi regreso es porque quiero ayudar al equipo
3570254 me sorprendi comprobar lo bien que me sent a pesar de que s lo me entrenaba una vez por semana
3570255 vino a saludarnos y aprovechamos para sacar unas fotos y nos dese suerte para el partido
3570256 nos sorprendi verle hablar espa ol adem s tampoco sab a que le gustaba tanto el f tbol
3570257 no me lo pod a creer para m fue una gran sorpresa verle ah fue espectacular un shock
3570258 messi es mi futbolista favorito un fen meno es el jugador m s creativo de todos me encanta verlo jugar es un talento con el bal n
3570259 etoo se queda porque quiere l y quiero yo y esas son las razones fundamentales
3570260 samuel etoo se queda con nosotros nos acompa ar el resto de la temporada soy consciente de lo que dije cuando anunci que no contaba con l entonces tambi n dije que si se ten a que quedar ser a uno m s de la plantilla su deseo lo que he podido captar en el vestuario y su comportamiento es lo que me ha hecho decidir que se quede con nosotros s que nos ayudar porque es un jugador con un talento inmenso mi trabajo es sacar el m ximo rendimiento de l y creo que as ser viendo su rendimiento futbol stico y su comportamiento con sus compa eros para m este tema est liquidado
3570261 hace ya una semana las negociaciones para contactar con otro delantero quedaron paralizadas por orden de txiki y m a no pod a ser que viniera alguien si samuel estaba aqu primero hab a que dejar salir
3570262 los necesito a los dos titi ha jugado muy bien en los partidos de pretemporada aunque s que hay opiniones enfrentadas a la m a yo soy su entrenador y est haciendo lo que ha hecho toda la vida estoy encantado con su rendimiento y vamos a sacarle el m ximo rendimiento posible
3570263 a m me pagan para tomar decisiones y las tomo ya dije en su d a que ni en el caso de deco ni en el de ronaldinho ni en el de etoo iba a prescidir de ellos por motivos futbol sticos en el caso de etoo est claro que he cambiado de opini n hay que recuperar al mejor samuel y estoy convencido de que lo haremos
3570264 en absoluto no le he pedido que se controle quiero que sea el mismo no se puede vivir once meses reprimido quiero que sea l con sus cosas buenas y las malas que todos tenemos
3570265 excitado con una sensaci n que no conozco y con ganas de que empiece el partido
3570266 se trata de un buen equipo que ha jugado m s partidos oficiales que nosotros lo que les da una ligera ventaja
3570267 el manchester united hizo una oferta por david silva que fue rechazada por el valencia
3570268 su familia est asentada y si tuviera que marcharse ser a solamente a otro club espa ol como el real madrid o el barcelona
3570269 villa y silva estar n esta temporada en el valencia
3570270 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3570271 lets explicitly own american in our programmes the speeches and the values he doesnt
3570272 the right knows obama is unelectable except perhaps against attila the hun
3570273 regardless of the sex of the candidates most americans in essence see the president as the father of the country they do not want someone who would be the first mama especially in this kind of world but there is a yearning for a kind of tough single parent
3570274 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable
3570275 perhaps his most memorable role was as woodcock the loyal railway employee who allows himself to be blown up not once but twice by paul newmans butch cassidy rather than let the train he is riding be robbed
3570276 butch you know if it were my money theres nobody id rather have steal it than you
3570277 theres more to this saga than people are led to believe or led to realize there really is
3570278 im not going to speculate on who i think has my granddaughter
3570279 these people know they are being watched they know it
3570280 evidence out there is circumstantial being growing up in someones mind they are narrow minded if they dont have a lot of intelligence in their head if they want to be negative they want to have a one track mind thats on them not on me
3570281 yeah you would think that the people who have my granddaughter right now would be smart enough to turn this girl back in to her family i dont want anymore of this going on
3570282 cada vez voy a peor si el hombro sigue as aspiraciones ninguna
3570283 no va a apoyar a quien practica estas f rmulas de dopaje lo que ha sucedido lo lamentamos profundamente
3570284 eso no es cosa m a sino del vicepresidente deportivo
3570285 lo nico que puedo decir es que hay mucha gente que tiene fe en m y yo tambi n la tengo no les quiero decepcionar
3570286 todo el mundo espera que gane la medalla de oro
3570287 porque quien tiene el r cord del mundo es bolt
3570288 es l quien debe demostrar quien manda en la disciplina
3570289 porque ya he pasado los correspondientes an lisis de sangre y orina en pek n el campe n ol mpico ha de estar limpio
3570290 hay algunos por detr s que son mejores que yo he superado a peirsol pero l ha demostrado ya miles de veces de lo que es capaz
3570291 voy a hacer lo posible para irme a entrenarme fuera porque en espa a me entreno solo es muy diferente estar trabajando cuando tienes en la calle de al lado mujeres de 60 a os y en la otra calle ni os de cursillos que hacerlo con nadadores de tu nivel que es lo que hacen todos mis rivales
3570292 hay que mostrar apoyo en el trabajo del entrenador y del nadador no s lo cuando se saca la medallita ha habido unos a os muy malos de relaci n con la federaci n cuando hay medallas es f cil el apoyo eso es como el f tbol cuando espa a gana hemos ganado cuando pierde han perdido
3570293 su mentalidad me gusta el ambiente es muy bueno y el sistema de entrenamientos se adapta a nuestra filosof a porque en estados unidos todo es trabajar a toda ca a y s lo el atento sobrevive
3570294 en el mundial de roma del pr ximo a o estar nadando bastante mas r pido que aqu
3570295 con casi setenta a os s lo haya ganado dos copas
3570296 son 18 motos y el n mero ideal yo siempre digo que son 22 a adir dos por a adir dos en la ltima fila no mejora el espect culo como ya ha quedado demostrado que lo que uno no puede hacer es un motor en su casa hay que esperar a las grandes marcas honda tiene seis motos yamaha cuatro ducati tambi n cuatro y kawasaki y suzuki dos a ver si los equipos que tienen dos tienen tres cuando posiblemente el a o que viene
3570297 we actually lost a police car at one of them fortunately the officer was alert and saw the jack knifing truck sliding towards him and managed to get out of the police vehicle before it was totally wiped out by a truck
3570298 ibuku rembulan dan bapakku matahari sejak kecil aku rindu dekapan ibu dan usapan lembut tangan bapak di kepalaku tapi aku hanya bermimpi
3570299 sedang desing timah yang membara bagai lagu keseharian yang kian kau hafal liriknya
3570300 karena telah ia perintahkan padamu untuk rasakan sakit itu dan kau hanya menjalankan
3570301 adakah tangan tuhan ikut menyusun strategi penyerangan itu dan korbannya harus orang orang tak berdosa saya tak berani menanyakan lebih lanjut takut tuhan akan marah dan murka malam ini dia bisa tembakan meriam di rumahku
3570302 lepaskan dulu sepatumu di lembah lidahku tak perlu ada batu
3570303 membaca puisi berarti bergulat terus untuk merebut makna sajak yang disajikan oleh penyair sajak yang baik merupakan bangunan bahasa yang menyeluruh dan otonom hasil ciptaan seorang manusia dengan segala pengalaman dan suka dukanya oleh karena itu sajak memerlukan dan berhak untuk dicurahi daya upaya yang total pula dari pihak pembaca yang bertanggungjawab sebagai pemberi makna pada sajak itu a teeuw dalam alinea pertama pengantar buku tergantung pada kata dunia pustaka jaya jakarta 1980 cetakan pertama
3570304 el p blico sabe lo que nos jugamos y todos debemos echar una mano para superar la eliminatoria
3570305 vamos a dar lo m ximo para que se marchen satisfechos
3570306 existen mucho motivos para ir al campo ojal se animen a venir porque creo que ver n un gran partido
3570307 la gente que est cerca de barcelona puede coger el coche cenar ir al campo y pasar un buen d a
3570308 girl you know its girl you know its girl you know its
3570309 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3570310 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3570311 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3570312 all of the questions that youre going to ask you have to submit in written form if they dont like the questions you ask then they will tell you and theyll say that you cannot ask those questions
3570313 no entiendo porque se dice que chaparro y yo estamos enfadados
3570314 podremos ver las cosas desde un punto de vista diferente pero eso no tiene nada que ver porque al final siempre hay consenso
3570315 y esto se demuestra con los futbolistas que han venido y el esfuerzo que se est haciendo
3570316 estoy donde quiero estar y como todos los entrenadores quiero tener a los mejores futbolistas pero a veces no es posible por las limitaciones de la entidad pero intentaremos traer a los refuerzos posibles acordes a la econom a del club
3570317 entre lo que chaparro quiere y lo que yo tengo para gastar tenemos que traer lo mejor que podamos por ahora estamos contentos con lo que se ha fichado y estamos luchando juntos para traer m s
3570318 pero yo tengo que ce irme a lo que me dice la gente que gestiona el club y el dinero del que disponemos para ello
3570319 hay dos buenas personas que por razones distintas no son hoy parte de esta organizaci n y es una pena
3570320 le gustaron el campo las instalaciones y que est en buenas manos
3570321 yo estoy muy a gusto y a mi hermano le agrad el campo las instalaciones aunque al equipo no lo conoce sabe que me deja en buenas manos
3570322 samuel se llev una grata impresi n de la ciudad de las instalaciones de nuestra manera de trabajar adem s se mostr predispuesto a colaborar con nosotros en los actos del centenari
3570323 la visita que nos hizo samuel no est al alcance de la mayor a de clubs igual que el convenio con el bar a o el partido del villarreal son actos que engrandecen la efem rides
3570324 un jugador interesante con detalles muy buenos y un enorme futuro
3570325 los pilotos deben ser conscientes del peligro del final de recta
3570326 es un circuito con personalidad propia y tiene unas caracter sticas que lo asemejan m s a circuitos r pidos como spa o monza que a lo que hasta ahora conoc amos como circuito urbano lo que han hecho es impresionante porque en el mundo no existe otro trazado no permanente que reuna las caracter sticas de este
3570327 tres o cuatro amigos de escuder as de f1 me han pedido la informaci n para sus simuladores
3570328 se llega a final de recta a much sima velocidad puede ser un punto conflictivo por eso los pilotos deben ser muy conscientes del peligro y no intentar ir por encima de sus posibilidades
3570329 es muy bonito y r pido no se parece en nada al de m naco
3570330 es muy bonito y r pido no se parece en nada a m naco porque las curvas en valencia son mucho m s r pidas
3570331 tuve mis dudas de si estar a acabado a tiempo porque cuando empezamos a rodar a n faltaban algunas cositas pero al final me qued impresionado
3570332 la chicane de luna rossa porque primero se cierra mucho y despu s se abre
3570333 la recta que viene despu s del puente giratorio es importante tener un coche r pido para que no te cojan el rebufo adem s desemboca en una de las frenadas m s fuertes del circuito se frena a casi cien metros de la curva y de sexta se pasa a segunda
3570334 es la zona previa a la entrada en meta puesto que son curvas enlazadas en las que vas a 300 km h y desembocan en un ngulo de primera marcha el nico del circuito sin duda el punto m s complicado de todo el trazado
3570335 se ver n muchos adelantamientos porque la pista es ancha
3570336 se ver n muchos adelantamientos porque la pista es bastante ancha mucho m s de lo habitual
3570337 es totalmente distinto a otros urbanos parece m s un circuito permanente dentro de una ciudad con los temas de seguridad muy presentes
3570338 me divert mucho en valencia lo mejor de todo es que es un trazado muy variado que por lo general es r pido pero tambi n agresivo de repente te encuentras curvas lentas en las que tienes que frenar de golpe
3570339 ser muy bonito porque se notar n mucho las diferencias entre los coches buenos y los malos
3570340 el asfalto que no ten a agarre porque lo hab an puesto hac a poco los pianos eran demasiado agresivos y la entrada al pitlane estaba mal se alizada pero estoy convencido de que todo esto lo arreglar n de cara a la f1
3570341 me impresion la ltima curva con un giro de 180 despu s de venir a tope es impresionante
3570342 el grupo tiene mucha calidad y no pueden pesarnos las piernas la eliminatoria es a cara de perro ante un rival cualificado pero no es momento de dudas sino de salir a por todas y rubricar un largo trabajo de meses l gicamente marcar un gol aqu en alemania nos dar a mucha chance aunque cabe recordar que la eliminatoria dura 180 minutos
3570343 la decisi n de la uci de proceder a un nuevo an lisis de la muestra b est en consonancia con la letra y el esp ritu de las regulaciones antidoping de la uni n ciclista internacional y de los est ndares internacionales para los laboratorios adem s el panel considera que los dos an lisis de chatenay malabry dejaron clara la evidencia de la presencia de epo recombinante en la orina de iban mayo
3570344 sta es la cuesti n todo el mundo me lo pregunta la respuesta es que no lo s por supuesto que lo intentar pero para m es importante sumar puntos en los campeonatos de constructores y pilotos lo m s importante es progresar en ambos pero desde luego que tratar de ganar en alemania es asfalto me gusta y es una superficie en la que lo he hecho bien en el pasado pero habr que ver c mo va con los nuevos neum ticos y qu tiempo tenemos
3570345 para el equipo que yo gane un rally no es lo m s importante y no me est n presionando pero personalmente quiero ganar y creo que este a o lo lograr
3570346 porque es el mejor piloto que existe y es r pido en todas las superficies
3570347 cuando tu compa ero de equipo lo hace tan bien a veces cuesta motivarse
3570348 soy una persona competitiva y est en mi naturaleza seguir luchando
3570349 we went on a saturday afternoon for an early dinner
3570350 a great place for breakfast food and sandwiches served in ample quantity with a basic standard diner ambience
3570351 two days ago i married the best man in the world
3570352 la principal raz n de mi regreso es porque quiero ayudar al equipo
3570353 me sorprendi comprobar lo bien que me sent a pesar de que s lo me entrenaba una vez por semana
3570354 the media frenzy surrounding spears was significantly aided and abetted and intensified after sam lutfi came on the scene
3570355 theres one paparazzi agency thats emerged as having the inside track on britney all the time theyre the ones who know where she is where shes going its called x17
3570356 one of the owners of x17 told me that last year she began getting messages from lots of people with funny names we know that sam in the past has used a lot of pseudonyms
3570357 after that she said one day out of the blue sam lutfi called and introduced himself by name then he started calling more and more often
3570358 by the time i was with the paparazzi they were sitting there getting text messages from him at regular intervals telling them where she was where she was gonna go
3570359 le quieren en el fenerbah e y no s lo ellos
3570360 entrena como el resto y con cierta alegr a que le caracteriza no hay nada m s
3570361 yo he estado trabajando con mi plantilla conf o ciegamente en ella si hubiera venido perfecto y si no tambi n
3570362 es un gran futbolista le acogimos de la mejor forma posible cuando se uni a nosotros durante nuestra estancia en bogot y el debut inmediatamente demostrando su enorme calidad le ha sido muy f cil integrarse a un club como el real madrid
3570363 es un t tulo oficial y queremos ganarla para nosotros tiene la m xima importancia
3570364 the light or lack of light definitely created a wonderful dining environment for the restaurant
3570365 service was s h i t t y maybe the waitress was having a bad day or she was on her rag
3570366 whaaa didnt they just put this in front of me where did it go
3570367 the hummus is good whispering if youre stranded in a desert and theres no mcdonalds around

3570378 well its only two hours away if we can get good seats then we should go
3570379 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
3570380 it is clear from the way new zealanders consume alcohol and the harms that result that we need to make real and enduring changes
3570381 there is a huge pressure to work hard play hard and drink hard
3570382 thats very similar to what were achieving here with our speed enforcement at the lower end where were getting better results at the higher end
3570383 its something weve been working on just by being persistent deterring people
3570384 he was not denied a promotion he was hired for a specific job there was a retirement and he was not given the job

3570412 well of course it f ing well matters its about where we come from where the world comes from where the bleeding universe comes from
3570413 i dont know anything about this i dont want to know anything about this i am not even the slightest bit interested in this and therefore i dont understand how anyone else could be interested in this so does it matter
3570414 they always have to tune their guitars before they play something what does it matter
3570415 of course it matters of course you have to tune it otherwise it sounds horrible
3570416 right so how it sounds to you now is equivalent to how it sounded to me before ok
3570417 the result from telstra has hurt the market a little bit
3570418 i didnt think it was that bad but it was just the outlook
3570419 the cba was a reasonable result but if you took both out the market would be down anyway today just on what happened offshore
3570420 while very good research work produced a list of seven possible names for the men dna matching techniques were only able to confirm the identity of two of the five prior to the re burial ceremony with full military honours last year
3570421 confirmation of george storeys identification was made using dna together with compelling historical research
3570422 it has been a long arduous process but now pte storeys place of burial is known to his country and most importantly his family

3570441 this is the best evidence to date that elite suppressors can have fully pathogenic virus
3570442 thats a good sign in terms of developing a therapeutic vaccine
3570443 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state

3570455 oh that is so much time to plan a party
3570456 i think its a step forward that we were able to reach an agreement on fully investigating the issue again
3570457 if the agreement is not acted upon then everything will break down if that happens we will also take necessary measures
3570458 she was examined for abdominal pain related to gunshot wounds
3570459 its been three years and i need to get back in here
3570460 the tourist areas of town have been open for business for a long time
3570461 but getting people back into hard hit neighbourhoods is one of the challenges we still face
3570462 the evidence that has come out has strengthened my view that fuelwatch is bad policy
3570463 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3570464 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3570465 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3570466 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3570467 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3570468 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3570469 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3570470 in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problems government is the problem

3570753 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3570754 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3570755 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3570756 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3570757 i was certainly encouraged to hear the speaker last night suggest a willingness to allow the house to have an up or down vote on the merits of unlocking the potential of americas abundant energy resources but the proof will be in the proverbial pudding
3570758 we are asking that she bring our american energy act up for a vote
3570759 if she brings it up under regular order then amendments will be allowed and well have that debated what we want is a chance to have that debate and have a vote

3570806 we dont know what the fate of this chemical is we have no idea what its potential long term toxic effects are we dont know whether it metabolizes or degrades into other chemicals that are harmful
3570807 the chemicals are used in such huge volumes we need to know whats in our furniture and the implication of those chemicals were exposed to on a daily basis
3570808 chemtura evaluated the bromine component of firemaster 550 in accordance with epa guidance for toxicity and submitted the data for the epa to review firemaster 550 was not fully commercialized until the epa completed their assessment and determined that firemaster 550 is not persistent bioaccumulative or toxic to aquatic organisms
3570809 we have supplied the necessary testing required to date by the epa and will be submitting additional data early in 2009 in accordance with the terms our consent order
3570810 based upon test data submitted thus far epa has concluded that this new chemical component is not expected to be persistent in the environment or accumulate in living organisms
3570811 we have no information and thats a concern the industry says the tests that theyve done say these chemicals are not as persistent or bioaccumulative as the pbdes but i havent seen any of those studies
3570812 finding them in house dust means that for us as people theres an opportunity to come into contact with it every day were getting it in our hands and into our mouths if its in sediment fish have the opportunity to get it into their bodies and if the fish are eaten by bigger fish and its persistent you have an opportunity for it to spread beyond where its located

3570815 obviously this has some significant concern for the industry because it could have far reaching implications

3570882 as a man who has no interest at all in deflowering a virgin i would have to agree that warning flags would go up if i encountered a chronologically mature woman who had never had sex i dont see what is wrong with that in the slightly unlikely event of there being a woman in her mid twenties who is attractive personable and just hasnt got around to having sex yet because she is too busy doing other things yet now wants to get laid my suggestion to her would be to go on vacation alone somewhere where no one knows her and screw the first presentable man who comes along no one will ever know her secret

3570895 innegabile che ci avete reso un servizio enorme nel fermare quello stregone ed i suoi compagni erano settimane che depredavano la zona uccidendo chi rapinavano in modo sistematico

3570907 qualcuno di voi sapeva che hanno saldato il nostro conto alla locanda

3571177 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3571178 disney is suing a couple for two costumes the couple bought for their party clown business experts think disney is sending a message to possible trademark violators marisol and david chaveco owners of kool klown party people purchased costumes of a tiger and a donkey not knowing it would give disney a reason to come after them
3571179 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3571180 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3571181 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3571182 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3571183 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3571184 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3571185 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3571186 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3571187 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3571188 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3571189 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3571190 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3571191 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3571192 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3571193 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3571194 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3571195 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3571196 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3571197 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3571198 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3571199 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3571200 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3571201 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3571202 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3571203 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3571204 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3571205 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3571206 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3571207 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3571208 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3571209 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3571210 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3571211 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3571212 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3571213 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3571214 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3571215 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3571216 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3571217 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3571218 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3571219 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3571220 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3571221 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3571222 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3571223 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3571224 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3571225 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3571226 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3571227 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3571228 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3571229 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3571230 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3571231 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3571234 seriously the man invented langauges and histories for his characters
3571235 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3571236 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3571237 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3571238 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3571239 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3571240 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3571241 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3571242 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3571243 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3571244 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3571245 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3571246 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3571247 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3571248 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3571249 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3571250 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3571251 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3571252 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3571253 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3571254 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3571255 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3571256 who are open to doing something on the production side
3571257 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3571258 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3571259 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3571260 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3571261 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3571262 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3571263 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3571264 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3571265 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3571269 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3571270 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody

3571284 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3571285 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3571286 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3571287 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3571288 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3571291 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3571293 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3571296 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3571297 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3571298 dont get upset and dont worry about it or ill get upset too
3571299 i just want to see my little girl thats all
3571300 but you dont get everything your way ill see what today brings
3571301 its like someone got a light and lit it its so bright
3571302 hes an absolute nob a bully arrogant selfish egotistical boastful and he winds everyone up so i dont like him
3571303 i think i might just wear my red dress on friday
3571304 we had been cycling for two days hadnt slept for two days and we werent even invited
3571305 please give me chocolate and be nice else ill be horrible
3571306 shes one of the main people that have been praying for them to be happy
3571307 now shes up they dont seem to give a damn thats my opinion i dont know if its true
3571308 i dont know if its true but id be very sad if any friends dont stick together
3571309 everyone has different friends you have friends that dont mean your friends have the same friends

3571313 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3571314 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3571315 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3571316 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3571317 to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3571318 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3571319 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3571320 i call it a great beginning toward not just accountability but toward the kind of transparency that has been lacking in the clerical culture not just in the archdiocese of chicago but elsewhere
3571321 it isnt the end it isnt a solution but a beginning to a more cooperative solution to what remains a crisis
3571322 if these two properties dont make sense dont worry as things will become clearer once we look at a demo
3571323 since the approval of human papillomavirus hpv vaccine gardasil in june 2006 28 cases have been reported of pregnant women miscarrying after receiving the vaccine saying that this miscarriage rate is no different than that of the general population the fda has said that it will not call for further investigations into the drugs safety the miscarriage reports come from the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers which contains raw data about any event that occurs after taking a medication that might be related to use of the drug
3571324 would not be in the best interest of the community
3571325 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3571326 with spring and floriade just around the corner we may well see many more commitment ceremonies and partnerships registered before the end of this year
3571327 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
3571328 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
3571329 they dont get the right amount of time with their families and this gives them an opportunity to have at least one week where they are not at the office or workshops
3571330 its a key ingredient of keeping people motivated and happy when you are addressing the calendar which makes next years difficult for them
3571331 what were trying to do is respond to things that were finding and the thing were finding is people are getting creative so we need to be creative in finding solutions
3571332 were trying desperately to set up it systems that alert us to critical things like addresses phone numbers names that sound similar
3571333 weve been testing it we just havent got it fully implemented yet
3571334 if this person de la torre was following safety regulations we would not have these people dead today its a travesty
3571335 i think we need to give this individual a full opportunity to be heard but if hes guilty of what we suspect he needs to feel the weight of the penalty
3571336 our guess is that the banks projections will show inflation moving back to target in the medium term but possibly with upside risks
3571337 the bank will probably hint that rates can come down but not yet
3571338 is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint

3571340 its a really funny website you should check it out
3571341 o cup dh race for aids awareness and climate change
3571342 look at those americans who do they think they are
3571343 the rs spyders first race on german soil and in particular the n rburgring is something very special for us
3571344 itll certainly be exciting and a real highlight for spectators
3571345 after the long break in the lms i can hardly wait for the n rburgring race
3571346 this circuit will be particularly suitable for our car the rs spyder has excellent balance and its high downforce makes it a true master of cornering
3571347 i conducted tyre tests with porsche vehicles for nine years here in the mid eighties i feel right at home in the eifel
3571348 to stay in the swing of things we also practiced our pit stops
3571349 the race in the eifel will not be easy for us with many slow and semi fast corners on this circuit we wont be able to make the most of our power advantage
3571350 but to win on the n rburgring would be especially wonderful
3571351 male or female it doesnt matter everyone is in love
3571352 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3571353 we therefore recommend to the software updates from apple in the eye this you get through itunes
3571354 we advise customers to keep an eye on apples software updates
3571355 you can go through long streaks when you dont win anything
3571356 some players can be effective on a relatively short bankroll but others need more of a cushion theyll get stressed out and play scared if they dont have enough money behind them
3571357 if youre playing 10 20 limit i think 10 000 is about right
3571358 you should never play a limit where you feel uncomfortable
3571359 if you were to play all of the 10 000 buy in events you could spend half a million over the course of year
3571360 even top players can have years when then dont cash for 100 000 so having a proper bankroll is critical
3571361 you need a much bigger bankroll in tournaments than you do in side games
3571362 a lot of people play tournaments without nearly enough you easily need 100 buy ins maybe 200
3571363 dont play phil ivey heads up i tried that once and i failed miserably
3571364 la honestidad no es una virtud es una obligaci n
3571365 they never warn of the outcome of the accused when the sky clears
3571366 in the end the most horrible stories choose themselves and a precipice flows from hesitation
3571367 this is how the other pours itself into us from anguish to comfort
3571368 identity is found in the books coat not in arguments nor in lean antonyms we undress of their future or their tiredness
3571369 when i was younger i was stricter i said the sacraments are the sacraments of the faith and therefore where there is no faith there is no praxis of faith and thus the sacrament cannot be conferred and i discussed this latter with my priests when i was archbishop of munich as time has gone on i have come to understand that we must follow always the example of the lord who was very open to those on the fringes of israel at that time as well he was a lord of mercy very open according to many official authorities with sinners embracing them and allowing himself to be welcomed at their dinners attracting them to communion with him
3571370 if we can perceive even a flicker of desire for communion in the church a desire also of these children who want to enter into communion with jesus i think it is fair to be more generous naturally of course one aspect of our catechesis should be to make it understood that communion first communion is not an ending event but rather demands a continual friendship with jesus a journey with jesus
3571371 in these sense naturally we should do everything possible in the context of the preparation of the sacraments in order to reach the parents as well and thus make them aware of the journey they are on with the children they should help their children to follow their own desire to enter into friendship with jesus
3571372 if parents have the desire for their children to make their first communion this desire often a social one should be extended to a religious desire in order to make a journey towards jesus possible

3571376 tra la professoressa e gli allievi esistono invalicabili limitazioni di comunicabilit tale fatto che rende agli allievi difficile lapprendimento delle materie di insegnamento e praticamente impossibile la comprensione delle lingue classiche porr i sottoscritti genitori in dovere di chiedere il nulla osta per iscriverli ad altro istituto gi dallinizio del prossimo anno scolastico

3571407 the edf and guerrillas are on the planet but there are signs that they arent the only people there
3571408 the following is a prophetic warning from azusa street 75 years ago concerning the dangers of a christless pentecost
3571409 we may not hold a doctrine or seek an experience except in christ
3571410 any work that exalts the holy ghost or gifts above jesus will finally end up in fanaticism whatever causes us to exalt and love jesus is well and safe the reverse will ruin all the holy ghost is a great light but focused on jesus always for his revealing
3571411 where the holy ghost is actually in control jesus is proclaimed the head the holy ghost his executive
3571412 the temptation seems to be toward empty manifestations this does not require any particular cross or death to the self life hence it is always popular
3571413 we may not put power gifts the holy ghost or in fact anything ahead of jesus any mission that exalts even the holy ghost above the lord jesus christ is bound for the rocks of error and fanaticism
3571414 there seems to be a great danger of losing sight of the fact that jesus was all in all the work of calvary the atonement must be the center for our consideration the holy ghost will never draw our attention from christ to himself but rather reveal christ in a fuller way we are in danger of slighting jesus getting him lost in the temple by the exaltation of the holy ghost and of the gifts of the spirit jesus must be the center of everything
3571415 where two or three have gathered together in my name there i am in their midst
3571416 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the pre eminence
3571417 that in all things he might have the pre eminence
3571418 this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
3571419 the spirit descended bodily like a dove but the focus was on the lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world not the dove but the lamb
3571420 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
3571421 when he the spirit of truth is come he shall not speak of himself he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you
3571422 he will show you my glory my power my kingdom he will remind you of all my words
3571423 why ask god for what he has already promised just get hold of the promises and simply command deliverances
3571424 oh god where can i find an evangelist who doesnt care about money or who is not promoting something
3571425 the shame of this generation is that we have too many talented men of god and only a few who have touched god in prayer
3571426 this is such a busy age l have no time to pray
3571427 those who want power line up to my right those who want purity line up to my left
3571428 god giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us purifying their hearts by faith
3571429 the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness
3571430 what can my faith get me what miracle will he perform for me
3571431 how shall i stand before him how shall i make it at the judgment
3571432 how do i feel how do i get happiness how do i get the desire of my heart
3571433 can i withstand that moment when i stand before the judgment seat of christ how can i withstand when ive lived so carelessly so selfishly so neglectful of his great salvation

3571466 the purpose of these changes is to reduce ambiguity improve consistency and narrow interpretive differences even within the services they are a positive step forward
3571467 in 1986 our existing rules made sense at that time very few federal action agencies had any in depth expertise with section 7 and listed species but that is not the case today we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3571468 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3571469 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3571486 esta es una cifra muy sustancial aunque no lo parezca es la primera vez que baja la venta de cantidad de combustible en casi dos d cadas
3571487 el hecho de que los precios sigan bajando obedece a dos factores principales en esta ocasi n uno es la especulaci n internacional y el segundo obedece a la ley de la oferta y la demanda

3571495 if your child comes to this school we will guarantee that we will get your child into college we will be with you with your child from the moment they enter our school till the moment they graduate from college
3571496 they get what middle class and upper middle class kids get
3571497 they get safety they get structure they get academic enrichment they get cultural activity they get adults who love and them and are prepared to do anything and i mean im prepared to do anything to keep these kids on the right track
3571498 we spent a lot of money trying to make sure these kids get a good start because we wanted them to go into our school
3571499 and so im as disappointed as you all are that your child didnt get in
3571500 after my first lottery i said were gonna have to open more schools you sit there and watch those parents its the saddest thing ive seen it really is
3571501 i grew up in a very similar condition to a lot of our children
3571502 single mom she had four kids overwhelmed doing the best she could do living in tenements with roaches and mice and rats thats something thats driven me i think all of my life
3571503 i invest in companies and other things for for a living and i can tell a good management and a good leader when i see one
3571504 so if they dont produce youre saying that youll pull your support from that
3571505 but yeah let me put it a different way the intensity and level of the support will be directly related to outcomes that are produced
3571506 if i know that those kids are gonna fill our penitentiaries that were gonna be spending in new york city 45 and 50 000 a year on that child for 20 years i mean 20 doesnt bother me one bit
3571507 middle class families know education begins at birth poor parents dont know that
3571508 were just trying to tell the parents look you have to start giving them the kinds of stimulation thats gonna help those brains develop
3571509 how do you keep em in control you know if you dont hit em you know

3571596 serving god is utterly different from serving anyone else god is extremely jealous that we understand this and enjoy it for example he commands us serve the lord with gladness in psalm 100 2 there is a reason for this gladness it is given in acts 17 25 god is not served by human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything we serve him with gladness because we do not bear the burden of meeting his needs rather we rejoice in a service where he meets our needs
3571597 no one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment for the patch will pull away from the garment making the tear worse neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins if they do the skins will burst the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined no they pour new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved

3571607 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3571608 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3571609 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3571610 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3571611 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know

3571625 masa liburan telah memberikan waktu yang cukup kepada saya untuk santai dan menyembuhkan cedera jadi saya berharap bisa sembuh tepat waktu
3571626 ketika saya kembali dari laguna seca dokter saya mengatakan kalau saya membutuhkan istirahat separuh musim atau minimal sepekan
3571627 saya memang tidak dapat berlatih selama menyembuhkan cedera jadi saya menghabiskan waktu untuk menyembuhkan cedera tangan dan kaki selama beberapa hari di mallorca
3571628 tangan saya memang masih sakit namun bagian pergelangan dan jari sudah semakin membaik sedangkan kaki memang masih diperban untuk menghindari hal yang tidak di inginkan untuk itu saya berharap bisa tampil maksimal di brno nanti
3571629 cedera tersebut terjadi pada bagian penahan beban di kaki dan dokter bilang kalau mendapat terlalu banyak tekanan lagi maka itu bisa menjadi masalah besar
3571630 ini keputusan yang sulit dan saya merasa kecewa dengannya saya pikir saya sebaiknya berada di rumah menjalani rehabilitasi dan pemulihan
3571631 saya akan kembali fit di misano dan berusaha mengakhiri musim dengan baik ada banyak pembalap yang memaksakan tampil meski kondisinya tidak 100 padahal itu bisa membuat masalah mereka bertambah parah
3571632 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pada suatu malam keluar dan shalat di masjid orang orang pun ikut shalat bersamanya dan mereka memperbincangkan shalat tersebut hingga berkumpullah banyak orang ketika beliau shalat

3571635 as earth was being formed out of the collision of space rocks the heat from those collisions and from the increasing gravitational energy of the planet made the entire planet molten even the surface any water present would have evaporated and gone off into space as the planet approached its current size however its gravitation became strong enough to hold gases and water vapor around it as an atmosphere because comets are largely ice made up of frozen water and gases a comet striking earth then would have vaporized the resulting water vapor would have been retained in the atmosphere eventually falling as rain on the cooled and solidified surface of earth therefore the water in earths oceans must have originated from comets

3571639 wow man shit is like totally getting fucked up in georgia
3571640 forget the who the what the when the question here is why
3571641 t his argument rests on a misunderstanding of d c scope of employment law not to mention the plain text of the westfall act which directs courts to look beyond alleged intentional torts themselves
3571642 is broad enough to embrace any intentional tort arising out of a dispute that was originally undertaken on the employers behalf
3571643 a reasonable juror could find that a laundromat employee acted within scope of employment when he shot a customer during a dispute over missing shirts
3571644 jury reasonably found that a mattress deliveryman acted within the scope of employment when he assaulted and raped a customer following a delivery related dispute
3571645 the detention and interrogation of suspected enemy combatants was a central part of the employees duties as military officers charged with winning the war on terror
3571646 the detention and interrogation of suspected enemy combatants was the type of conduct the defendants were employed to engage in
3571647 alleged tortious conduct was incidental to the defendants legitimate employment duties
3571648 allegations of serious criminality d id not alter 23 2 we further agree with the district court that further discovery is not warranted to determine precise times and locations of the defendants conversations with the press even if some our conclusion that the defendants conduct was incidental to authorized conduct
3571649 s peaking to the press during regular work hours in response to a reporters inquiry falls within the scope of a congressmans authorized duties
3571650 ability to do his job as a legislator effectively is tied as in this case to the members relationship with the public and in particular his constituents and colleagues in the congress
3571651 actuated at least in part by a purpose to serve the master
3571652 o f course the defendants may discredit public critics of the executive branch
3571653 it was in my scope of work to be speeding and on drugs
3571654 it was in my scope of work so too bad that he was in the way of my hammer
3571655 it is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream when you have something like a nightmare you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream it is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this
3571656 its not my job to tell her but zack how long did you think youd get away with this

3571662 i know i saw brian go out im very observant
3571663 well if youre so observant observe that fat head of zackys and tell me what the hell to do
3571664 so what were just going to pretend like this never happened

3571666 yes its good because thats not what i feel at all britt you know i love you you know it why would you put me in this position

3571677 glad theres still a girl who wants to f ck him
3571678 he has to run away because we have to chase him
3571679 if youre coming to a show without some chronic thats a big mistake
3571680 i came out sideways out my moms thing and it started from there they had trouble getting me out so from there its been pretty dumb and pretty stupid
3571681 weve had different drummers but me and kyle are pretty much brothers weve been friends for 29 years so you know jamming with all your best friends and brothers
3571682 oh hell yeah we fight were not going to claim to be perfect super humans
3571683 people fight thats just part of the way the world works like when youre in bed with your girlfriend do you fuck better after you fight or do you fuck better before you fight afterwards the shits more meaningful
3571684 we didnt get signed a lot of people think brad nowell signed us but he just said to his sound guy go record these guys there was no signing it was just an honor for us because the guys in sublime are gods brad was a god
3571685 he had a lot of great stuff he still had in him
3571686 we were huge fans of sublime and it sucked that their career and his life was cut short but their music was timeless for us even that style staying alive is important for music and brad would want it that way it just sucks that hes not around to give us more than he did because the stuff he put out is incredible
3571687 the key to being successful is having to bust your ass on the road when you go out there when you first start nobodys going to be there because nobody is going to know who you are
3571688 but when you play those shows those security guards and bartenders they go and tell their friends and thats kind of how it starts each show gets bigger and bigger but the most important thing is literally hitting up towns over and over again and staying on the road
3571689 whats helped us the most has been our relentless hard work and traveling and not going to college just skipping it and heading onto the road since we were 16 and just playing gigs ever since then the fans i mean weve made a lot of friends over the years at shows and a lot of those friends come back year after year after year
3571690 i think we have some of the most awesome fans there are
3571691 theyre always adamant about pushing slightly stoopid to everybody which is cool because its like having a voice behind the music
3571692 our cd sells fine we sell about 100 000 of each record and thats fine if 100 000 people bought the record three other guys burned it so thats like 300 000 people listening to it as long as the music gets out there the shows get bigger and bigger
3571693 i dont feel ripped off because hes at the show and hes telling his friends yo check out this band its a digital world and people are going to download it anyways you cant get upset because now you have a new fan and hes going to buy one more ticket to the show thats just one more crazy motherfucker at the gig
3571694 honestly i think were outside of what the industry is dealing with weve been independent for so long that everything is working for us
3571695 were not on a label that has to cut back because weve always been independent weve never had a crazy overstock of shit we dont need its all about putting out music the way weve been doing it and i dont see us changing our ways because thats what slightly stoopid is all about
3571696 i dont deal with the politics of the industry i deal with music
3571697 my manager deals with booking shows and i deal with music if theres a complication that i dont agree with we work it out
3571698 i havent met sly amp robbie and im looking forward to it they pretty much invented how reggae is done so its a little weird
3571699 its going to be crazy to go out with them it will definitely be a humbling experience i dont like that were headlining id rather go them
3571700 i will forgive their iniquity and their sin i will remember no more
3571701 i dont use the word pet i think its speciesist language i prefer companion animal for one thing we would no longer allow breeding people could not create different breeds there would be no pet shops if people had companion animals in their homes those animals would have to be refugees from the animal shelters and the streets you would have a protective relationship with them just as you would with an orphaned child but as the surplus of cats and dogs artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding declined eventually companion animals would be phased out and we would return to a more symbiotic relationship enjoyment at a distance
3571702 one day we would like an end to pet shops and the breeding of animals
3571703 in the end i think it would be lovely if we stopped this whole notion of pets altogether
3571704 we have no ethical obligation to preserve the different breeds of livestock produced through selective breeding one generation and out we have no problems with the extinction of domestic animals they are creations of human selective breeding
3571705 shortly after taking office pacelle announced a merger with the fund for animals which have assets of over 20 million and the doris day animal league
3571706 allow for a more substantial investment of resources in political and lobbying activities

3571717 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3571718 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3571719 there is nothing left now but to ensure that my infant son does not meet the same fate as the rest of my doomed race
3571720 i will send him to a new planet where he will i hope be raised by simple but kindly country folk and grow up to be a hero and protector to his adopted home
3571721 on his new planet earth physiology will react to the radiation of a differently colored sun causing him to develop abilities far beyond those of mortal men
3571722 he will be faster than a speeding prius stronger than the existing superfund program and able to leap mountains of red tape in a single bound these superpowers will sustain him in his never ending battle against conservatives wealthy industrialists and other environmental supervillains
3571723 on tuesday evening we held our first safety forum meeting in las vegas the meeting went very well with a great turnout from the controllers specifically from l30 l30 vice president sara george did a great job organizing and mobilizing her local
3571724 a circuit card that helps feed radar signals from the bob hope airport in burbank to a major southern california air control center malfunctioned causing radar radio and telephone communications to shut down temporarily and forcing controllers to scramble to divert flights officials said monday
3571725 you never want to see something like this happen but we did have a backup system to deal with any outage
3571726 saat itu kemungkinan besar dia belum meninggal sebab hidup dan mati adalah hak allah
3571727 dokter kan manusia padahal pengetahuan manusia tentang kehidupan sangat terbatas manusia tidak mungkin 100 persen benar
3571728 itulah yang menjadi pertimbangan pihak keluarga terutama kakaknya andreas agar romo benny dipindahkan ke rs lain
3571729 dengan kondisi romo yang babak belur di muka dan luka di kepala tersebut kan seharusnya banyak istirahat supaya segera pulih jadi bukannya tidak mau diekspos semata mata supaya istirahatnya maksimal dan cepat pulih
3571730 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3571731 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3571732 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3571733 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3571734 and hopefully some of us will hear the at the end of the week
3571735 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3571736 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3571737 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3571738 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3571739 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3571740 the territorial integrity and belonging of and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3571741 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3571742 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3571743 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
3571744 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3571745 a style of computing in which massively scalable it enabled capabilities are delivered as a service to multiple customers using internet technologies
3571746 so to have any kind of claim to originality i really have to write my own stuff
3571747 but good music like that will always rise back to the top
3571748 i dont think of it as a revival really its an extension of the american canon that is soul music
3571749 most pop music is like one big pot of soup and there are people emerging with something different thats sticking up out of the pot
3571750 i thought that once the music disappeared in the 80s it wouldnt ever come back again
3571751 today its an underground thing its one of those things that club djs and college kids are really into and theyre whats making it happening
3571752 we played at the apollo in harlem and people were asking me why most of the audience was young white college students
3571753 i said all i see are fans screaming sharon we love you and the dap kings
3571754 it used to be that mtv was the big thing breaking you and people would see up front what you looked like
3571755 now with james hunter the first time you hear him he could easily be black and it really wouldnt make a difference either way
3571756 ive seen sharon jones and they are a mixed band taking you back to the 60s like its a james brown revue theres a lot of showmanship involved and its really fun
3571757 whenever you have these economic downturns people turn to music that is uplifting
3571758 people long for the human touch thats lacking in a lot of other popular music soul has a familiarity to it but its something that hasnt been exploited a lot in recent years
3571759 so to have any kind of claim to originality i really have to write my own stuff
3571760 if you look at the urban ac chart there are songs with a retro feel noel gourdins the river or alicia keys teenage love affair
3571761 they have some contemporary element to go with the classic feel sharon jones and ryan shaw take it a step further and theyre harder for radio to relate to
3571762 the curators of music today are very different from who they were just 10 years ago
3571763 when people get a daptone record they know its going to be raw and soulful
3571764 it wouldnt take much for any of those bands to have a fluke hit on commercial radio and interest a major label
3571765 but the desire to be on a major label now is about will it get me into wal mart or target and the trade off is having someone telling you how to do your music
3571766 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3571767 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3571768 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3571769 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3571770 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3571771 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3571772 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3571773 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3571774 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3571775 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3571776 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3571777 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3571778 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3571779 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3571780 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3571781 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3571782 he didnt do a lot of tricks he just loved to ride around
3571783 i saw nathan put his foot out to stop the skate board
3571784 the car hit his leg and i saw him go down to grab it then the car hit his head and he was swung up into the air about 40 50 feet he did at least three cartwheels in the air and then i saw him smack his head and land on his stomach i screamed at the top of my lungs
3571785 the first thing nathan would do after he came home was tell his mom everything he did his mom told me that he loved me so much and that i meant the world to him
3571786 i thought i would be ready to see him but i didnt think it would be that bad
3571787 we were really close he hugged me at least 15 times that day
3571788 if he wasnt going that fast nathan would probably not been hit or he wouldnt be hurt that bad
3571789 ive seen a lot of people being careless ive seen cars fish tailing around corners and going into oncoming lanes
3571790 i cannot recommend a site any more than this one
3571791 he is absolute in his justice seeking beautifully informational staunchly analytical and a joy to behold i consider it both a duty and a delight to keep coming back here
3571792 upon only a first and second look i d say you should read everything posted by voice of a native son
3571793 intelligentaindigena has great commentary and interesting links that will always make you leaving the site a little more wiser
3571794 an extraordinary blogger posting on news from around the world for issues dealing with oppression of any kind
3571795 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
3571796 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores
3571797 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amen
3571798 all things whatsoever i have commanded you the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that winneth souls is wise
3571799 i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing
3571800 taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
3571801 how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things
3571802 have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase
3571803 let us never forget that we have no part in ones salvation
3571804 by which we are born again so every soulwinner should carry a bible with them
3571805 wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith
3571806 1st corinthians 15 58 dont worry about getting people saved you just get the gospel out to as many people as possible and the holy spirit will do the rest it is not our eloquent speeches or shrewd tactics that win people to the lord but rather the power of the gospel romans 1 16
3571807 theres a big difference between the two the difference between heaven and hell
3571808 if this doctrine were true then no one could ever be saved because even the best of christians still commit sin lordship salvation is a damnable lie the only sin that a person needs to repent of to be saved is
3571809 rely upon the name of the lord shall be saved knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified
3571810 worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly
3571811 the teaching that a person cannot be saved unless they are willing to forsake sin after being saved is self righteousness the need is great in this present hour for soulwinners
3571812 then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest
3571813 when a man prays for a corn crop the lord expects him to say amen with a hoe
3571814 then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus
3571815 there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion of the band called the italian band a devout man and one that feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to god alway
3571816 name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins

3571823 a philadelphia veterans hospital says it may have given insufficient radiation treatment to more than 100 prostate cancer patients the philadelphia va medical center says its reviewing records of 114 cancer patients who may have received the wrong dosages during the past six years hospital spokeswoman fern billet says two patients have since died she says its not clear if the feared error played any role in their deaths the men had radioactive rods or seeds implanted in the affected area to destroy cancer cells experts say most men who undergo only that type of treatment have low risk prostate cancer the hospital says the program has been suspended and a review is under way
3571824 he pokes his head out occasionally but thats about it
3571825 you can see the progression theyre comfortable in the system
3571826 weve got three guys whove got good experience at quarterback and to be able to add some of the young guys and guys who redshirted last year is great
3571827 weve definitely brought more speed to the mix and were excited about it were still young and its still about maturing and gaining confidence as we go but weve definitely increased the speed and given ourselves more of a chance to make more big plays in the spread
3571828 we told those guys last season going into the spring that we wanted somebody to leave no doubt thats exactly how i put it on who would be the no 1 quarterback
3571829 but when youre dealing with 18 to 22 year old men and with college football being as physical as it is weve been thrown a few curve balls with david wolke missing all of spring practice which allowed brandon smith to step up and have a heck of a spring and now this fall with k
3571830 were bound and determined to let it play out and have one guy be the guy but i learned from last yea when i said that i was a one quarterback guy and then we used two and it worked for us were going to have to manage this like we do with any other position on the team and do whatevers best for the team
3571831 theyre pretty much neck and neck right now weve charted every kick theyve made throughout spring ball and until now and both guys have kicked at about an 80 percent ratio which is what you want
3571832 so they are both right there together and well continue to put them through pressure in situations and scrimmages and keep track of the plusses and minuses and see who wins the job
3571833 it really didnt change me at all this spring like the injuries did last fall
3571834 right now i think the whole offense is doing great were coming along and installing new stuff and really doing great things
3571835 as opportunities come open at different positions guys will look around to try and find a way onto the field
3571836 ive been impressed with all of them so far and with the guys we already had there were in a very good situation
3571837 i think the attraction is the unique combination of scenery the white bluffs and the wildlife and that odd collection of nuclear sites
3571838 i would like to see the b reactor preserved because i would like that story to be told
3571839 its in a fairly good spot in terms of healing
3571840 theres no ligament involvement i dont know much more about the areas of the wrist to comment more its at a place where its reasonable to think that it will heal quickly we were fortunate in that respect
3571841 yeah that seems reasonable well re x ray it and go through that process again i think its very reasonable as were sitting here today but as everybody knows bones heal at different paces and its too hard to say definitively at this point
3571842 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left
3571843 i just wanted to go out and gauge how i feel
3571844 i felt ok i just got some new stuff orthotics in my shoes and this is the first day i ran in them my feet are a little sore right now so its something i have to get used to once i get used to it and get the soreness out ill be back out here
3571845 he felt better and decided to do a few things
3571846 hes as good a backup outfielder as there is in baseball
3571847 he could be a starter on most teams and hes played great this year every time hes gotten an opportunity its still tough to play a man down but it certainly makes it easier that the team is winning and hes been helping
3571848 im not so sure that sitting out the year last year and managing doesnt come into play a little bit
3571849 i wish we could just sign guys and make them manage for a year or two and then let them play
3571850 i didnt learn the game until i quit the game
3571851 kapler had the rare opportunity to quit the game manage and get that experience teaching the game in turn you learn the game that had to help
3571852 i really enjoyed the relationships i developed with those guys so i try to maintain them if i can
3571853 i totally agree i think that sometimes as players we lose sight how difficult it is to be a coach or a manager
3571854 if we were in the playoffs braun would be playing
3571855 we dont have to right now well take full advantage of the time
3571856 i do not have any pain or soreness in my knee
3571857 he favors dunking on your head thats what he favors
3571858 i know ive got to keep that in mind and try not to let all the pressure overwhelm me
3571859 for me i dont know if this is the right thing to say but hes yet to play in an nba practice hes yet to play in an nba game so i think the expectations are more on him personally than it is on everybody else
3571860 we know how good he can be but he is still a rookie
3571861 i think a lot of people forgot how good we could have been last year
3571862 a lot of people say this is gregs team i think were a great team and greg is just a great addition
3571863 lets listen to music while were camping far away from our cars
3571864 but its an individual choice im happy i did it i would do it again
3571865 its one chance every four years to get out an image of a healthy athletic woman instead of an underweight underage model athletes bodies are much healthier and theyre functional
3571866 people told me it was something theyd show to their daughters i mean i was obsessed like everyone else with fashion magazines when i was a teenager its natural to look for the body ideal
3571867 here is a woman a great athlete 160 pounds who can bench press her own body weight and squat 180 pounds
3571868 smart women why wouldnt they also want to be seen as sexual
3571869 as humans we like the physically good looking the beautiful
3571870 but how much better if shes also the fastest woman in the world
3571871 gave me the opportunity to go out into the business world and prepared me for life i owe it all to being an athlete and having the opportunity to swim in college
3571872 were very very shy i mean the first time i went to a topless beach in spain i almost dropped dead then i saw a grandma over there and thought yeah i can do this
3571873 i knew i was attractive to the opposite sex but didnt see myself as sexy
3571874 i got a letter from a whole platoon in the u s navy saying how sexy i was i thought you gotta be freaking kidding
3571875 im committed to finding ways to improve compliance and reduce taxpayer burden so that we begin to bridge the tax gap which accounts for 345 billion in legally owed but uncollected federal revenues each year
3571876 i looked the man in the eye and he said watch more volleyball
3571877 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
3571878 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
3571879 sumo was a band from 1997 to 2007 then owing to diminished creative impetus and the mounting forces of entropy it ended no one was happy about it but thats just how things go sometimes we all still get along and music is still being made just under different guises
3571880 i dont need pitchers next year its my opinion i dont think freddy itll be hard for him to be ready for the playoffs
3571881 to be ready that quick hes going to start in the minor leagues you only have one week to go two weeks to go i need a pitcher to win now next year i dont care about next year i dont i need a pitcher right now we didnt have a conversation about freddy
3571882 the take home message here is its a big deal
3571883 the massively framed building and quarter acre of land fenced with pailes at the corner of farewell and marlborough streets
3571884 its giant beams small stairway hard against chimney tiny front hall and cavernous fireplaces are the very essence of 17th century american architecture

3571914 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3571915 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3571916 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3571917 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3571918 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3571919 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3571920 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3571921 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
3571922 this should not be a very difficult decision to make
3571923 while ata cannot by law even suggest uniform pricing policies to our members we will bring this matter to their attention for their independent consideration

3571925 airlines routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation
3571926 we can help them with additional expenses for travel but soldiers have to submit a receipt and it has to be looked at by our finance people
3571927 we appreciate the vfws help in assisting soldiers it would certainly make it easier for soldiers but there are other ways to help them recoup their money for army travel

3572150 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything

3572153 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew

3572191 there is no way that any finite human can know enough to have worthy opinions on more than a few subjects yet the politicians pretend theyre supermen and superwomen who know enough to make vast decisions on a wide range of issues and to force everyone else to abide by their supposed wisdom
3572192 takes advantage of the decentralized knowledge of hundreds of millions of people no one knows everything or even very much about most things but most people know many things about small but important areas of life it is this decentralized knowledge that drives the world
3572193 we have three guys we believe we can win with i know its a luxury in college football these days i feel very good about it were just training them all like theyre going to be the starter
3572194 there was some struggling going on early i think they were pressing
3572195 but since practice six theyve really made great strides all in different ways
3572196 its not a case where were not playing well and thats why the decision has been hard
3572197 really all three of us have come out and competed hard and made plays i think thats made the decision tough i think a lot of teams in the pac 10 would like a quarterback situation like we have
3572198 while very good research work produced a list of seven possible names for the men dna matching techniques were only able to confirm the identity of two of the five prior to the re burial ceremony with full military honours last year

3572201 the result from telstra has hurt the market a little bit
3572202 i didnt think it was that bad but it was just the outlook
3572203 the cba was a reasonable result but if you took both out the market would be down anyway today just on what happened offshore
3572204 i have really enjoyed the summer so far from a personal point of view
3572205 the competition now is pretty healthy as we have five bowlers with stuart broad fred flintoff harmy ryan sidebottom and myself fighting for four places
3572206 on top of that you have all the guys in county cricket and simon jones coming back its all healthy and keeps you on your toes
3572207 so im not sure if i think i belong there in the team but if i can keep putting in the performances and keep taking wickets and if i can do as much as i can to impress the selectors they wont be able to leave me out
3572208 consistency is something i have been striving for and the confidence i have got from my consistency and the wickets ive taken this summer has been great
3572209 the one thing that has pleased me more than anything is the way i have kept my speeds up as i have bowled quite a lot of overs this summer
3572210 i have not been used to bowling this many overs in a summer so keeping my speeds up in the mid eighties and sometimes a bit more is encouraging

3572215 theres no pressure added just go out and play football
3572216 we all realize that its now a great opportunity for a lot of receivers and with the situation were in now it kind of magnifies a little bit more
3572217 but our approach is to stay calm try and stay relaxed and not to think about added pressure
3572218 i honestly thought i was going to play defensive back thats what the coaches told me and what a lot of the guys wanted me to do but when i got there they were having a lot of receiver problems
3572219 thats all i remember is them saying were going to give you a shot at wide receiver and i was like ok i was just happy to be there
3572220 hes got great skill hes fast i mean his athletic ability is special
3572221 the first thing ill do as president is sign the freedom of choice act

3572237 for me i dont know if this is the right thing to say but hes yet to play in an nba practice hes yet to play in an nba game so i think the expectations are more on him personally than it is on everybody else
3572238 we know how good he can be but he is still a rookie
3572239 i think a lot of people forgot how good we could have been last year
3572240 a lot of people say this is gregs team i think were a great team and greg is just a great addition
3572241 its here for us to admire if we can afford the beauty of it if we can afford the luxury of turning our heads great words wont cover ugly actions and good frames wont save bad paintings how can we expect anyone to listen if we keep using the same old voice we need new noise new noise for the real people

3572302 there is nothing in the available data that indicates that the introduction of variable fees in england has yet had any lasting impact on the level or pattern of demand for full time undergraduate education
3572303 whilst it is encouraging that student numbers have not decreased in our universities it is extremely worrying that there has been no change in the number of students from the very backgrounds the government is spending considerable sums of money on persuading to apply
3572304 we remain unconvinced that asking students to pay more for a university education is the best way to encourage those from poorer backgrounds to apply

3572314 all of australias major banks increased interest rates by around 0 5 per cent on top of official rate rises in the past 12 months to protect themselves against an increase in their own borrowing costs
3572315 but after announcing a profit of 4 79 billion we have to ask if the bank is putting the needs of a relatively small number of investors over the thousands of families struggling to meet loan repayments and put food on the table
3572316 but with profits up and the banks own costs coming down it is time to wind back some of those rises and commit to passing on any cut made by the reserve bank of australia in september
3572317 i think that theres been a lack of leadership which is why our airline has been dragged to the bottom of the industry

3572400 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3572401 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3572402 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3572403 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3572404 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3572405 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3572406 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3572407 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3572408 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3572409 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3572410 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3572411 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3572412 this completely original title explores gotham citys darkest location the infamous arkham asylum but as a routine prison transfer goes wrong the joker sets his demented plan into action and batman comes face to face with an army of his worst enemies
3572413 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3572414 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3572415 i am the master of my fate the captain of my soul
3572416 in the wake of the unanimous ruling of the court of appeal for the second appellate district to recognize homeschooling as a legal option in california two of californias most senior officials have given their opinion of the ruling
3572417 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and homeschooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
3572418 i am pleased that the courts have clarified the right of california parents to homeschool their children i have respected the right of parents to make educational decisions they feel are in the best interest of their children i recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in homeschooling it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
3572419 in the uk we have something called nhs direct there is an online service but i dont think you can type in symptoms but you can research conditions and illnesses
3572420 i read an interview with the owners of this virginia spa they said that when they did group pool sessions with the doctor fish some folks got lots of attention and some folks didnt
3572421 on july 31 californias fourth district court of appeal affirmed that californias medical marijuana laws are valid despite the fact that federal law does not make any provision for the medicinal use of marijuana this means that state county and local officials whether they like the laws put in place by the people through the initiative process and later the legislature are duty bound the implement those laws for years various officials who dont approve of the laws that give bona fide patients the right to use possess and grow marijuana have argued that because federal law places marijuana on schedule i which prohibits any use including medical under the 1974 controlled substances act csa that the california law is invalid the doctrine of federal supremacy they have argued doesnt allow states to have less restrictive laws

3572428 johnny me ha hecho pensar en mi regreso al canto
3572429 it was built for soccer but it clearly had an understanding that it was convertible for football and to be expanded to 30 000 seats thats what city council voted on
3572430 he wants to please soccer and football fans together theres no reason they cant coexist this isnt the hatfields and the mccoys but im not sure mlse president richard peddie feels that way
3572431 the mayor has told us a number of times that if the toronto argonauts want to come to bmo field hell do all he can within the confines of his lease agreement with mlse
3572432 what we have is a 70 million public asset that is in the shape of a stadium
3572433 the primary occupant is the game of soccer and what council said in 2005 is there has to be some compatibility option for football there
3572434 it has to be an option because that was built into the approval council gave how that happens has to be worked out
3572435 i had a meeting with richard peddie three or four months ago and he informed me that in late august there may be a time to sit down and talk about what they want to see in the stadium expansion
3572436 now i understand its not on his radar screen i spoke to richard last week by e mail and its not a priority for him right now
3572437 whether we could write a cheque for stadium expansion or help secure funds im not sure but the toronto argonauts could be part of making that happen
3572438 why didnt this bozo whos supposed to be on the lookout for potential good deeds think of this herself
3572439 but it may be some time before we can start again or crank up
3572440 we have unique types of machinery its just not off the shelf
3572441 uranium is not such a dangerous material as uranium oxide its a very very low concentration
3572442 como muita massa e pizza e durmo o m ximo que posso eu odeio perder
3572443 the eu has as yet quite a weak foreign policy and the eu as a union hasnt been very much in evidence
3572444 the europeans are taken less seriously by the russians but on the other hand they are better placed for any kind of intermediary role because the americans are obviously on the side of the georgians
3572445 a lot of the european member states are seen as less biased against russia
3572446 and thats why you see those countries that have good links and have been less critical of russia are very much in action
3572447 the european union wants to mediate between russia and georgia but its influence is marginal it is a conflict between the u s and russia about regional hegemony
3572448 the old members of the european union have more moderate positions while the new ones which have had to deal with russia in the past have firmer ones
3572449 the new members are very fearful of russia and poland which has said in the past that the european union is far too nice to russia and that russia is dangerous now feels vindicated
3572450 the large member states will probably say that thats right but its meaningless because russia is still our neighbor its our biggest energy supplier were not going to go to war with russia so we have to find a way of dealing with this
3572451 that move would frighten a lot of people particularly some nato members because it would for the first time open the possibility of nato peacekeepers coming up against russian forces
3572452 saakashvili makes the valid point that russia cannot be seen any longer as an independent neutral peacekeeper what do you put in its place the eu doesnt have any guts and nato is the only body left that has peacekeepers who are prepared to go into situations like that

3572470 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principal that our works define who we are then god is evil
3572471 what kind of question is this of course it exists have you never been cold
3572472 in fact sir cold does not exist according to the laws of physics what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 460 degrees f is the total absence of heat all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature cold does not exist we have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat
3572473 once again you are wrong sir darkness does not exist either darkness is in reality the absence of light light we can study but not darkness in fact we can use newtons prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color you cannot measure darkness a simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
3572474 of course as i have already said we see it every day it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
3572475 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is not like faith or love that exist just as does light and heat evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light
3572476 hey i cant access this website i need to do my job when you guys switched access you made it company i work at employees only it keeps taking me to an access manager password screen

3572482 as queer folk living in heterosexist cultures too many of us have experienced the
3572483 where the writers of isaiah amp matthew were coming from
3572484 they will feed beside the roads amp find pasture on every barren hill they will neither hunger nor thirst nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them the one who has compassion on them will guide them amp lead them beside springs of water
3572485 though your mother or father may forget you i will not forget you see i have engraved you on the palms of my hands your walls obstacles challenges concerns are ever before me
3572486 a slice of the love amp heart of this faith community
3572487 a progressive theology from a progressive amp loving god who calls us all to responsible mature living which considers god self amp most certainly others
3572488 if i could offer you only one tip for the future sunscreen would be it the long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience i will dispense this advice now
3572489 the best advertisement is sight if we have new development down there people need to see it now the floodwall is a barrier
3572490 mama pirate cmon lets go find treasure look mama pirate i found sumpin in my hand
3572491 hi is someone who masquerades as cleo here shes a dentist were old fertility friends shes pregnant or maybe shes had her baby already could you tell her that chovy is here yes these shoes are from wal mart
3572492 thank you god for being our friend in amp through jesus christ
3572493 that when jesus saw their faith he said to the man paralyzed son your sins are forgiven their faith
3572494 at some point in all of our lives were all going to need some mat totting friends
3572495 as long as we are on earth the love that unites us will bring us suffering by our very contact with one another because this love is the resetting of a body of broken bones even saints cannot live on this earth without some anguish without some pain at the differences that come between them there are two things which we can do about the pain of disunion with one another we can love or we can hate hatred recoils from the sacrifice amp the sorrow that are the price of this resetting of broken bones it refuses the pain of reunion but love by its acceptance of the pain of reunion begins to heal all wounds
3572496 so if anyone is in christ there is a new creation everything old has passed away see everything has become new
3572497 the new wine of the love of jesus the christ
3572498 one who fails to reach the great wall is not a hero

3572501 these guys are survivors yet here they are in our time when more than 40 percent of amphibians around the world are threatened
3572502 all these different factors are leading to their decline and its really really serious weve been finding dead frogs by the hundreds and thousands
3572503 if you ran into a problem where you really were concerned about something and wanted to do detailed scientific analysis these rules would make it much harder to do that
3572504 the endangered species act has evolved into something that is less concerned with helping species and more concerned with exerting economic control and holding up or sometimes stopping important economic activity
3572505 were very dependent on the same environment those animals are dependent on so like a canary going down into cave if the canary dies were next
3572506 okay this is the amount of loans that the students are taking out this is what you need to disperse

3572509 has given me a great propensity to believe that ideas of sense are produced by corporeal things
3572510 my personality is somewhat inward looking and therefore i am somewhat selfish and self centered by nature i am not naturally a very empathetic person i would have to say that my burden for broken people comes from the influence of christ in my life showing me how to love people like he loved them i have a long way to go

3572517 i released a dove from the boat it flew off but circled around and returned for it could find no perch
3572518 i utnapishtim released a dove from the boat it flew off but circled around and returned for it could find no perch i then released a swallow from the boat it flew off but circled around and returned for it could find no perch i then released a raven from the boat it flew off and the waters had receded it eats it scratches the ground but it does not circle around and return i then sent out all the living things in every direction and sacrificed a sheep on that very spot
3572519 weve been getting too many calls like that to deal with them all please handle the water issues on your own
3572520 our past awardees are a phenomenal group of women who inspire motivate mentor and teach in their communities every day through education maybelline new york couldnt be more proud to support them were looking forward to seeing this years entries

3572526 there is a common language in this music as in othercommunal arts
3572527 youd have to imagine his odd verbal style here he had once owned of lester circa 1934 but told stu zimny and myself that it had disappeared long ago and even if we had acetates stacked to the ceiling the question might be both unanswerable and moot
3572528 wahai manusia kamu tebarkanlah salam berjamulah makanan hubungilah silaturrahim dan kerjakanlah sembahyang waktu malam di kala manusia sedang tidur nescaya kamu akan masuk syurga dengan selamat

3572533 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3572534 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3572535 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3572540 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3572541 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3572542 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3572545 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
3572546 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
3572547 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
3572548 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
3572549 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3572551 voight my concerns for america obama sowing socialist seeds in young people
3572552 sen barack obama has grown up with the teaching of very angry militant white and black people the rev jeremiah wright louis farrakhan william ayers and rev michael pfleger we cannot say we are not affected by teachers who are militant and angry we know too well that we become like them and mr obama will run this country in their mindset the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
3572553 if we can solve it for the peak hours it will solve it for all
3572554 it is fair to conclude that the number of detainees is likely to be between the number who were arrested during gop conventions in philadelphia in 2000 and the number who were arrested in new york in 2004
3572555 in philadelphia there were 600 arrested in new york 1 800
3572556 i really dont believe that it is going to reach 1 800 with the information i have now
3572557 the st paul police are telling us they will be doing things more thoughtfully than new york
3572558 they are being trained to avoid some of the arrest situations
3572559 if the felony arrests go higher we have a second tier approach more volume and more attorneys
3572560 a third tier where all heck breaks loose with more lawyers involved in the charging
3572561 democratic party is a party of inclusion we respect the individual conscience of each american on this difficult issue and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party
3572562 so what are they saying that because we want to protect the rights of the unborn our own party says were automatically republicans this has to be one reason that our party is having trouble appealing to many people in churches
3572563 in queste pagine ho cercato di mettere tutto me stesso soprattutto dopo essere stato cos duramente ferito dal destino tuttavia ho ancora un ritaglio di vita e strano scoprire lintensit che luomo ha nei confronti della voglia di vivere basta una bolla daria rubata da una grotta ideale sommersa dal mare per dare la forza di continuare quella lotta basata su un solo nome speranza ecco se leggendo queste pagine qualcuno sentir la rinnovata voglia di sperare avr assolto il mio impegno e un altro momento di questa vita cos affascinante cos travagliata e cos punita si sar compiuto una cosa certa nonostante le mie funzioni non siano pi quelle di una volta sono fiero di poter dire che sono ancora un uomo

3572567 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3572568 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3572569 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3572570 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3572571 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3572572 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3572573 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3572574 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3572575 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me
3572576 to get to the heart of that youd have to do the kinds of research that havent been done
3572577 my guess is that the obama campaign understands that and they know its not enough to be ahead
3572578 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3572581 fourteen years ago i did not even know there was a ronald mcdonald house
3572582 it will always be easy to remember the ronald mcdonald house birthday larkin was born on the same day as their 10th anniversary
3572583 we were going to watch the texas production for my husbands birthday
3572584 it was a welcomed comfort how the staff treated my family and the other families staying there
3572585 the ronald house was only a few blocks away from the hospital so i knew i was close by
3572586 what john and i do is match the donations collected dollar for dollar
3572587 i wish that they had unlimited beds to help the families in need
3572588 it was completely designed for the family providing them a home away from home

3572590 i either want to die or become a human because just being a vampire is so utterly pointless
3572591 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3572592 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3572593 its interesting you know theyre both the same age theyre both monster superstars cultural myths almost from the 1980s into the 1990s but in so many ways theyre hard to compare
3572594 one could argue that as a musician a dancer and an entertainer michael jackson has it all over madonna by a factor of 10
3572595 hes the guy whos up there with frank sinatra bing crosby elvis presley one of the top musical performers in our cultural history
3572596 it didnt sell as well as her music did a few years ago but it was a number one album and if anyone has ever proven that shes able of reinventing herself thats madonna
3572597 madonna has managed to stay creative and to stay relevant i think she still is in the popular music scene
3572598 i dont know what shell be like at 60 but mick jagger is there and hes rocking and rolling
3572599 theres no shrewder businesswoman she could probably run a music studio
3572600 he got to the point that he was so rich so powerful and so famous that he was allowed to kind of withdraw from any kind of reality
3572601 michael jackson is the example of someone who was truly spoiled and by spoiled i mean ruined by the level of fame that he achieved
3572602 he accidentally turned himself into a parody of himself and then its kind of hard to re emerge as a serious performer
3572603 i dont think its impossible i think hes still got talent but then you tie that in with the trial and that made an awful lot of people terribly uncomfortable
3572604 jackson withstood a trial which was very ugly and was vindicated the idea that he could be a pedophile having that in the news is not going to make your career any good
3572605 overall when you adjust for currency the sales were pretty much in line with expectations maybe even just a little light
3572606 as we go out through the rest of the year with the dollar strengthening currency could do a 180 and start being a negative rather than a positive
3572607 we have to see how theyll do against the macro headwinds impacting the u s and europe through the rest of the year especially with consumer spending under a cloud both domestically and now in europe
3572608 i dont think so i would have liked to do it in nine innings its been a long day but it definitely ranks up there with one of the best moments ive had
3572609 hes a different guy but hes definitely not a bad guy i think there was definitely a different sense that was going on in the clubhouse over the last week
3572610 to me hes the greatest hitter ive ever seen being able to play with him
3572611 i know theres other great hitters in the league i just havent been able to be their teammates his swing is unbelievable he really worked hard at trying to perfect it which seems almost ridiculous when you have such a perfect swing and youre trying to make it better
3572612 his whole career has been remarkable hes one of the best right handed hitters in history and his numbers speak for themselves he was a key part of two world series teams no one can ever take that away from him were not going to
3572613 were happy that jason bay is here because hes a great guy ive talked to a couple of teammates in pittsburgh and they say hes a really good teammate and a really good guy if youre going to replace manny ramirez youre not going to replace his stats if youre going to replace him youre hoping to get a good teammate and thats what we got

3572642 and it is now escalating into a political issue as south ossetia declared its independence from both georgia and russia
3572643 i am concerned that international aid might not be allowed to get to the region because of politics
3572644 i also am praying that the authorities can come to a peaceful diplomatic solution to this fighting
3572645 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people
3572646 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3572647 let there be no more fernandos his father alejandro marti said late monday after a memorial mass at which the founder of a national chain of sports stores and exercise studios alternately buried his face in his hands and wiped his eyes

3572649 in this first stage what democracy has brought is just an exchange of power among political parties
3572650 nothing has been done and we cannot remain silent any longer
3572651 but mexicans now have the sensation that democracy does not end problems it does not necessarily resolve problems
3572652 we condemn the impunity and the violence enough is enough it said

3572656 and how he finds it retarded to see on fansubs srsly this is a topic that gets repeated every year at otakons fansub panel i think
3572657 we typically make fun of bungled police operations by saying they were conducted by the gang that couldnt shoot straight
3572658 in this case they could shoot straight as a result they killed a familys two dogs in the midst of a misguided drug raid
3572659 rather than carefully checking the facts including talking to the local police department the county authorities acted rashly illustrating how the drug war threatens the liberties of all americans
3572660 absent exigent circumstances not present here so called no knock raids are an affront to the constitution
3572661 so is a shoot first ask questions later philosophy by the police yet the prince georges police have done this before last fall they invaded a house at the wrong address and shot the family dog all americans are at risk when the police behave this way just ask yourself what might happen if a suspicious package is delivered to your home and the cops bust in
3572662 but there is an even larger point law enforcement agencies have become more arrogant and less accountable in cases other than those involving drugs most people are aware of well publicized examples like waco and ruby ridge but similar abuses are common across the country though they usually receive little or no public notice
3572663 we all want police to do their jobs well but part of doing their job well is respecting the peoples constitutional liberties

3572681 it puts me in a more relaxed way of calling plays i have a little bit more freedom because we have taught him what to look for and how to get out of certain plays and get us into good plays

3572687 if weve been mabaduchi for so long why is it that we dont have a secret
3572688 even the ones who couldnt count change were fun to talk to
3572689 our number one problem was lack of fit we needed to hire people who could be successful instead of training square pegs to fit the round hole we now try to hire round pegs
3572690 the old manager hired employees who were a pleasure to visit with and talk to even the ones who couldnt count change were fun to talk to
3572691 the biggest part of an interview for me is to know at the end of the interview if you can stand to talk to the person for another two minutes
3572692 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3572693 mr tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election his party the mdc won a parliamentary majority
3572694 whatever happened between the two parties weve no knowledge of it
3572695 the process is on course and a lot of ground has been covered
3572696 there was disagreement on one element of the negotiations by morgan tsvangirai

3572702 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic ice
3572703 the crucial point is that ice is not building up enough over winter to restore cover and when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years
3572704 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3572705 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community

3572721 we chose network strategies because of the breadth of its experience across engineering finance and economics
3572722 there continues to be considerable public debate on new zealands broadband strategy
3572723 this follows significant announcements earlier this year by political parties and the release of the nzi institute report questions remain as to the best path forward for increasing broadband penetration for both business and consumers
3572724 network strategies will look at all the models already proposed locally and investigate international experience internetnz is aiming for a report that will both inform public debate and provide pragmatic advice for proceeding
3572725 we are delighted to be an active and valued contributor to the debate on broadband strategy for new zealand

3572730 as she steps into the separateness and independence of a mind stage around age 5 1 2 she also feels the loneliness that is inseparable from being independent no matter how well bonded she has been in her first years this shift towards independence and its sense of alone goes with the turf she simultaneously has the need to test out her metal and the need for reassurance that she is an inseparable and safe part of the whole
3572731 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god it was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord
3572732 avoiding pronouncing the tetragrammaton of the name of god on the part of the church has therefore its own grounds
3572733 apart from a motive of a purely philological order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
3572734 the name of almighty god expressed by the hebrew tetragrammaton and rendered in latin by the word dominus is to be rendered into any given vernacular by a word equivalent in meaning
3572735 notwithstanding such a clear norm in recent years the practice has crept in of pronouncing the god of israels proper name
3572736 the practice of vocalizing it is met with both in the reading of biblical texts taken from the lectionary as well as in prayers and hymns and it occurs in diverse written and spoken forms

3572778 it is fair to conclude that the number of detainees is likely to be between the number who were arrested during gop conventions in philadelphia in 2000 and the number who were arrested in new york in 2004
3572779 in philadelphia there were 600 arrested in new york 1 800
3572780 i really dont believe that it is going to reach 1 800 with the information i have now

3572792 show them that it wasnt a fluke and im here to contribute any way i can
3572793 mom i didnt want to go i just had so much fun
3572794 it is the generic packaging and selling of unique works of art i think industry mediocrity is more of a threat to the future of reading than television is
3572795 the dog run at 56th street and woodside avenue in woodside queens is frankly a disgrace to dog runs everywhere tucked away behind public school 11 in an elevated corner of doughboy plaza its less a dog run than a small squarish pit of dust
3572796 if you chart swimming over the years its not like box scores in baseball
3572797 if you look back at when world records are broken it escalates about a year before the games
3572798 i think everyone is wearing the suit now so were on kind of a level playing field
3572799 technology in all sports keep advancing and i think they will as technology grows i think sports kind of have to keep up with that technology its a great suit i love it
3572800 hopefully our sport stays that way certainly no one wants to lose to a suit we swim the race against the athletes next to us not the technology
3572801 personally i dont have any positive test to back it up but yes i think doping exists
3572802 the sport has become entertainment and its taken on the morals of entertainment we rely on an inadequate doping agency for the proof youre innocent until proven guilty the key word being proven it can be very depressing for clean athletes
3572803 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3572804 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3572805 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3572806 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3572807 i hate you die stop being condescending to me i hope your hamstrings plague you to the bench forever shut the fuck up why is this douchebag still talking to me id love to take his life

3572809 money is just an excuse to avoid thinking very much about the life you are living
3572810 and the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more
3572811 what would the world be like if nobody did a job they didnt want to do
3572812 stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau
3572813 an increase in potassium is probably the most important dietary choice after weight loss that should be implemented to reduce cardiovascular disease
3572814 a high intake of these minerals through increased consumption of fruits and vegetables may improve blood pressure levels and reduce coronary heart disease and stroke
3572815 the alkalizing mineral salts of sodium magnesium potassium and calcium are critical for maintaining the alkaline design of the body and to chelate dietary and metabolic acids all of these mineral salts can be found in whole unprocessed sea or crystal salts i have suggested ingesting at least 8 to 10 grams of mineral salts daily

3572817 desde el partido liberal estamos trabajando mucho con los partidos provinciales tratando de que haya un federalismo que marque una nueva dimensi n pol tica y deje de lado los personalismos

3572823 el problema energ tico es un problema serio no solamente en ituzaing sino en varios lugares de la provincia hay un fondo fiduciario energ tico que lo dise el ejecutivo y est en el senado pero todav a no tuvo tratamiento

3572832 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3572833 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3572834 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3572835 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3572836 i will be completely candid here and say that i have carried around a great deal of resentment toward older black men since my father disowned me when i was eight years old indeed i have had little tolerance little respect and very little interest in what most of them have to say for themselves it is the worst form of cowardice to bring a child into the world and then abandon that child either because you cannot cope or because you and the childs mother are not able to get along how many black boys and black girls have had their emotional beings decimated by that father void how does one break the vicious cycle begun on the plantations of black man as stud and what of slavery which lingers still in the collective bosom of black men in america so how could i really be mad at my father that no good do for nothing as my mother often referred to him i may never see the man again in my lifetime dont care to really but i know he is wounded like older black men and like a lot of younger black men in a state of arrested development
3572837 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3572839 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3572840 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3572841 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3572842 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3572843 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3572844 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3572845 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3572846 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3572847 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3572848 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3572849 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3572850 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3572851 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3572852 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3572853 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3572854 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3572855 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3572856 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3572857 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3572858 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3572859 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3572860 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3572861 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3572862 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3572863 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3572864 mr tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election his party the mdc won a parliamentary majority
3572865 we know that mr mutambara has a breakaway group of the mdc they have been involved in the talks as well but any outcome which emerged which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce
3572866 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3572867 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3572868 i should have known earlier more should have been done earlier

3572872 statements and explanations were too often taken at face value

3572881 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3572882 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3572883 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3572884 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3572885 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3572886 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3572904 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon
3572905 a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging
3572906 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon

3572910 most of the proponents of the nexus legislation would concede that given this is an election year its unlikely the legislation will pass
3572911 golden state retailers would be at a competitive disadvantage to out of state companies

3572913 a series of related images which when shown in succession impart an impression of motion together with accompanying sounds if any
3572914 i suspect we will see the next 14 attempting to address it in the next legislative cycle
3572915 as these technologies meet there is this question of what is digital goods and what is software
3572916 to define where technology is today and how it should be taxed
3572917 provided that the non electronic version of that item was not exempt
3572918 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3572919 the sale of digital music delivered electronically to customers for download on their computers constitutes the sale of intangible property and is not subject to sales or use tax
3572920 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3572921 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3572922 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3572923 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3572924 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3572925 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3572926 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3572927 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3572928 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3572929 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3572930 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3572931 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3572932 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3572933 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3572934 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3572935 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3572936 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3572937 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3572938 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3572939 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3572940 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3572941 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3572942 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3572943 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3572944 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3572945 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3572946 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

3572950 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3572951 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3572952 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3572953 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3572954 i think youll find that this is the real deal

3572958 i think the turnout is a great tribute to the team and these three players
3572959 i think people know this team is moving in the right direction and they wanted to come out and see these guys
3572960 this event gets me very excited for the season especially seeing the players here because i think this is a playoff team this year
3572961 im just ready for the season and this is a way to get started and get psyched for it
3572962 this is also a good way to come out and see people that you dont get to see during the summer weve got a lot of friends that weve met throughout the different seasons and this is our fourth season i start getting withdrawals during the summer so this is one of those ways to boost my fix
3572963 this is kind of a big deal and its really nice of them to do this for the fans
3572964 its indescribable what i think were going to have with him this season
3572965 i wouldnt miss this for the world in fact i just went and paid for my season tickets in full i didnt want to take any chances
3572966 when you walk up to the table and the guys greet you and its like youre neighbors or friends it adds a huge personal touch and you feel more invested in the team
3572967 great leadership what it is and what it takes in a complex world
3572968 police believe a body found in a small time evangelists home freezer is his wife and a mother of eight and arrested him on a murder charge as he preached at a small south alabama church
3572969 police said no one reported 36 year old arletha hopkins missing even though she hadnt been heard from in three years the body was discovered covered in a freezer in a utility room during a police search of the home in mobile after a relative of the preacher contacted police

3572975 this is not going to be a top down program
3572976 i think the economic situation is a lot stronger than what you hear in the media
3572977 we cater to a market that is sensitive to pricing if you put forth the right product theyre going to buy it
3572978 we are displacing customers daily that we are not able to supply we have to turn them away because we cant handle the current demand
3572979 what that tells me is that people are still traveling
3572980 the route 110 corridor is growing exponentially over the rest of long island
3572981 in our particular market the product were building has very strong corporate following with the companies that are present in that market
3572982 it started when we landed there was a big scene its been great the chinese people have been wonderful to me and they are all big basketball fans

3572985 walking in the stadium with 90 000 people was definitely a rush like i have never experienced in my life
3572986 it obviously meant a lot to me that fans actually cared what i do with the german national team
3572987 we had so much time in the olympic village a week before we started so i just came up with that idea and we had four or five or six guys do it

3573012 we were just kids back then he didnt appear focussed at all i wouldnt call it a temper but he did look like he had some concentration issues he was missing easy shots and getting irritated with himself
3573013 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3573014 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3573015 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed

3573023 se mueven dentro de un circuito financiado por el gobierno gringo de ee uu para diseminar sus pol ticas imperialistas y lo que ellos creen del concepto de democracia

3573025 la falta de inteligencia del imperio norteamericano en su af n de desvirtuar a los gobiernos revolucionarios tal es el caso de nicaragua
3573026 c mo se les ocurre traer a pol ticos fracasados si tuvieran inteligencia debieron de traer a gente que logr resultados para mejorar la vida de sus pueblos pero pol ticos fracasados que destruyeron inclusive a su pa s eso solamente me puede causar risa

3573055 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
3573056 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3573057 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3573058 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3573059 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3573060 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3573061 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3573062 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3573063 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3573064 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3573065 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3573066 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3573067 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3573068 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3573069 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3573070 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3573071 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3573072 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3573073 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3573074 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3573075 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3573076 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3573077 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3573084 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3573085 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3573086 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3573087 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3573088 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3573089 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

3573091 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3573092 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3573093 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3573094 all of australias major banks increased interest rates by around 0 5 per cent on top of official rate rises in the past 12 months to protect themselves against an increase in their own borrowing costs
3573095 but after announcing a profit of 4 79 billion we have to ask if the bank is putting the needs of a relatively small number of investors over the thousands of families struggling to meet loan repayments and put food on the table
3573096 but with profits up and the banks own costs coming down it is time to wind back some of those rises and commit to passing on any cut made by the reserve bank of australia in september
3573097 about three weeks ago you could see about 50 bugs per vine i mean it was crazy they were everywhere
3573098 they will chew a leaf in no time and defoliation on a grape vine is like cutting the right hand of a writer the leaves are needed for ripening the leaves are needed for sugar content the leaves are needed for color
3573099 this is the second year of heavy damage so were hoping somebody comes up with something in the future
3573100 as you can tell at a glance of the vineyard it looks pretty good but once you start getting in there it looks like the beetles have been around
3573101 we felt like we caught it just at the right time so we stopped the damage from being really bad
3573102 we have about 27 acres to watch and pay attention to every single little detail being the bugs or the rain or the sunlight or whatever

3573109 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3573110 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

3573117 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

3573119 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3573120 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3573121 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3573122 when the couple has made choices in integrity with their values that honor the planet its a green wedding theyve considered their impact with each choice theyve made
3573123 creating a wedding that is aligned with a couples personal values is new for people green weddings are less a greater sense of freedom and connection to values
3573124 one bride i worked with didnt want flowers that would die
3573125 she had arrangements of red yellow and green hot peppers
3573126 any wedding generates forty tons of carbon but green weddings offset the carbons the equivalent of taking seven cars off the road for a year
3573127 if you want your wedding to look like a conventional bridal magazine wedding it can cost you fifteen to twenty percent more because organics are more expensive
3573128 then there is cost associated with carbon offsets and other details if you want it to look over the top and you want to green it itll cost more
3573129 theres this idea that more stuff more food fancier dresses more show bigger favors and more gifts will make a great event
3573130 but you lose focus on the magic behind the wedding that youre in love and youve invited people to witness that and thats the real takeaway less becomes more
3573131 we have many amazing luxuries in california that you may not be able to get in iowa or kansas but my personal opinion is we will all move in a greener direction rather than a trend it will become a consideration
3573132 i asked the florist if he could get organic locally sourced flowers and he said he would have trouble with that the resources werent available
3573133 i doubt if those perfect roses we had were local and organic
3573134 how you celebrate while connecting to being responsible really is hard for people to do in events because they happen so quickly there are tons of materials and energy that go into this event thats over in an instant
3573135 when you plan a green wedding it may take more time to find the right sustainable product or service that will fit the theme or budget
3573136 the greening is interesting to me but whats more interesting is the interpersonal relationship
3573137 i enjoy the process of getting a deeper spiritual awareness of what theyre about as a couple how they want to be together how they want to make decisions i find that choosing to respect the planet makes people happier because the planet is a reflection of us
3573138 some couples may want to make it an educational experience but its also a celebration and a great opportunity to share your values with people youre making an effort to support markets that are life affirming rather than depleting its a misconception that people who have green weddings will shove it down your throat
3573139 families might be resistant because in their minds its a hippie wedding and its hard since the parents play a big role or may be paying for a wedding but theyre pleasantly surprised after
3573140 she was trying to convince me so many times that it wasnt what i wanted on the wedding day she looked at the bridal party and said it was beautiful
3573141 the parents see their children making choices that honor themselves they might think its weird but they get the sense that youre making choices that are healthy anybody who loves you will support you even if they dont understand it so in the end i dont find theres a conflict
3573142 some couples want to educate friends and family and some dont
3573143 all the couples ive worked with have put up a plaque that shows all the green things weve done ill create the plaque which says how much carbon weve offset along with a list about whats incorporated and why that matters
3573144 weddings are the biggest and best example that we have in our culture of a gathering where we celebrate love and part of what makes green weddings rewarding is that theres a depth of personal experience there
3573145 people leave a good wedding feeling in love with life theyre happy and its a really amazing experience
3573146 i tried them out because i was looking for another supplier other than malaysia and they were plumper and the meat was juicier

3573155 es una injusticia decir que el gobierno no ha hecho nada en el sur

3573157 we were really concerned they were missing out on some quality learning time especially since the first two hours are the literacy block
3573158 you are like b1 and b2 only f wit 1 and f wit 2
3573159 who knows but that on the lower frequencies i speak for you
3573160 the picture emerging from the indictment as formulated is that the utter prohibition on shooting a shackled individual has not been instilled and has not been internalized
3573161 what do you say shall we take him aside and shoot him
3573162 call us home our city our city our city our city breeds a twisted creed
3573163 the klan and the nazis suck and i am their enemy and im gonna fuck em up im not obeying your laws and im not getting on my knees while you burn a cross on my lawn im gonna shoot you fuckin dead im a black jew at a nazi klan rally and i cant be contained
3573164 theres a line drawn in the sand and in ted white amp blue this is how i define it ultimately on my side is a huge mass of humanity who says we are not going to ask what our country can do for us we are going to get up early and do what we can for our country on the other side youve got sniveling pimps and whores and welfare broads and people who think those are legitimate job descriptions siding with obama and hilary i dont know how a mind or a soul decays to that low i dont know how that happens
3573165 the bottom line is not just speaking ones mind but before the mouth opens the brain feels a duty to sponge information evidence and facts and always put them through the logic meter based on good will and decency
3573166 so when i do speak my mind its not just a knee jerk reaction but a well executed delivery of genuine sincere research so i know what the hell im talking about big difference you know im 60 years old and i dont have many hunches anymore i very rarely speak my opinion id rather hear my observations of irrefutable occurrences facts and again that dangerous l word logic i dare to genuflect at the altar of logic and someone who tries to pry my knee from the ground is gonna get a crowbar upside the head
3573167 logic serves everybody in a positive way its the abandonment of logic thats created these squawking critics of me god sent michael moore to find those who oppose me
3573168 all this energy all this confidence all this humility because im humbled by logic and all the music ive created even the pre recorded stuff from 62 63 jamming with the lords nugents first band it was about defiance i understood what howlin wolf and bo diddley and chuck berry were singing about i discovered it was about defiance and a celebration of life and my music and my politics are one and the same and what is politics other than an individuals pursuit of happiness and demanding from our employees i e elected officials that they exercise good will decency and logic in their policymaking my hand can stroke a puppy and change a diaper but it can also turn into a fist and knock the shit out of you its the same thing just depending on what the moments motivation might be

3573171 today i delivered a message on behalf of my constituents in the fifth district speaker pelosi bring back this house
3573172 we as a country cannot afford to wait another day to pass this legislation house republicans understand that the time to act is now and we will continue our protest until comprehensive energy legislation is passed
3573173 clearly the time has come for a stronger american trade policy
3573174 we can no longer afford to simply drift along as we continue to engage in trade with other nations we must respect international norms and ensure labor rights and environmental standards are met we must also ensure that american employers have a real comparative advantage and that we are no longer in a race to the bottom
3573175 by streamlining the process in which domestic companies seeking relief against import surges illegal imports and other crippling circumstances stemming from unfair trade we can ensure a level playing field for american manufacturers
3573176 at the same time however we must also revisit existing trade relationships in particular our relationship with china and ensure all countries honor past trading commitments instead of flagrantly violating international rules
3573177 having gained additional experience in developing effective trade negotiations since nafta was signed i believe we must join together and create an agreement that will strengthen not hinder our trade relations
3573178 what little mortal baby steps can i take today that will demonstrate expectancy prepare for my dreams manifestation and above all place me within reach of lifes magic

3573182 now they have decided that they can give students two years which actually we think is a good move because its been very hard for students to get any valuable professional type job when they got only a 12 month visa many employers would not want to commit to someone who could only stay for 12 months two years looks like a much better investment
3573183 para sa akin okay siya kasi bibigyan ka ng chance na makapag work for two years tapos pwede ka na makapag ipon bago ka makauwi sa pilipinas its a positive development compared dun sa dati na one year lang
3573184 i will try it wala naman mawawala sa akin at least i try ko yung uk education kung paano i apply dito

3573199 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3573200 i know a little bit about his character and everything is as advertised it is evidenced by the way his teams have played that he is very structured in the defensive zone
3573201 if you take a close look at what scott has done with young players at providence you dont have that kind of success without patience
3573202 i just felt he was the best fit for our organization just because youre in the nhl doesnt mean youre done developing scott has a track record of developing young players
3573203 the result from telstra has hurt the market a little bit

3573218 los ingleses que siempre hemos tenido un gran afecto por nuestro perro nacional tenemos que rechazar ese peque o engendro indescriptible que han tra do a nuestro pa s por mas que lo llamen bulldog franc s
3573219 el m rito sobre la existencia del b f de hoy en d a debe de ser compartido por inglaterra francia y usa
3573220 el m rito sobre la existencia del b f de hoy en d a pertenece a inglaterra francia usa y alemania y nunca debemos olvidar que sin las contribuciones de austria suiza pa ses bajos y b lgica es posible que hubi ramos perdido el tren
3573221 en un d a radiante de verano del a o 1909 cuando 4 criadores serios y amantes del bulldog franc s estaban sentados juntos en una mesa del parkhotel en munich y mientras discut an con af n el desarrollo de la crianza sintieron la necesidad de una agrupaci n de todos los criadores en un club fundandose as el internationale bouledogue fran ais club
3573222 en funci n de miembro de la junta directiva de ste club debo protestar en rgicamente contra tales difamaciones un club de perros falderos que lleva el bulldog franc s ni por lo mas remoto es un club especial un club de bulldog que trabaja para tres variedades s es un club especial para bulldog pero no un club especial para el bulldog franc s porque no se dedica exclusivamente a sta raza y as resulta que el ibfc es y seguir siendo el nico club especial de sta raza en alemania las afirmaciones de ese panfletario son por eso falsas y las afirmaciones falsas son seg n su declaraci n contrarias a las buenas costumbres deportivas
3573223 eso prueba dec an que los or genes de esta raza no suscitaron en francia ning n inter s digno de consideraci n y que el desarrollo de su cr a fue dejado al azar a la indiferencia e incluso al abandono
3573224 este peque o perro a pesar de lo que se ha dicho y escrito procede de nosotros los trabajadores franceses por lo tanto es a nosotros los que hemos dado origen a esta raza a los que todos los pa ses han tenido que acudir es posible que este perro haya salido de un terrier ingl s o de un bulldog ingl s o para ser mas exactos de un cruce de terrier y de bulldog lo que parece mas probable pero el bulldog franc s tal y como lo poseemos con orejas derechas y su porte gil y alegre resultado de una raza bien fijada es nuestra obra

3573292 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3573293 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3573294 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3573295 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3573296 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3573297 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3573298 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3573305 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3573306 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3573307 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3573308 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3573309 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3573319 the effort that tim and his team have put into promoting and spreading the word about these first and best in class tours is commendable it has been exciting challenging and incredibly hard work but the rewards are emerging in the form of excellent customer feedback and a strengthening forward booking pattern
3573320 like many new ventures we have experienced and felt pretty much every emotion from the excitement of launching through some disappointments to the satisfaction from our first bookings and receiving exceptional customer feedback all of which leaves us very optimistic about the future

3573370 its her nanny she is a young moroccan woman who is qualified to look after children and works in a care centre

3573373 dont treat me any different because im a girl once we all get in and put our helmets on were all racing the same kind of cars for the same race
3573374 thats the one nice thing about this series is that we havent really had a lot of trouble with that kind of treatment
3573375 most of the guys are very respectful they treat me just like any other driver
3573376 occasionally you do get a few guys and in different parts of the country i have also found its different because of the mentality at race tracks
3573377 yeah shes a girl but she can battle side by side with any of us guys any day

3573385 the outlook for prescription drug costs and for healthcare costs generally continues to be ominous price increases of more than 100 percent for certain prescription drugs means it is more important than ever to give the medicare program the power to bargain with drug companies for the best price so that seniors and taxpayers dont bear an unfair burden because of these price hikes the latest making sense alert calls for getting this issue back on the front burner of the political debate and it comes as researchers at the university of minnesota report that prices of some drugs have gone up well over 100 percent and in a few cases over 1 000 percent in the past year
3573386 so healthcare voting friends the democratic national committee dnc platform committee added the language guaranteed healthcare for every man woman and child in america to its party platform yesterday in pittsburgh because i was there and i mean there as one of the people who negotiated the changes in language with rep john conyers and dnc platform committee member bob remer of chicago i can tell you that there probably was a little nodding to the clinton camp and some hope to quiet the single payer rumblings it is significant that language shift from universal health coverage to guaranteed health care and we who are in this for the long haul must grab this moment and this victory and make it our own

3573395 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation we should all understand it is like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national culture especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3573396 every teams strategy would be the same they would try to physically break us down
3573397 being bruised battered and with many nagging injuries mounting the team overcame the pain by playing an almost perfect offence and defensive team game throughout the tournament going undefeated sacrificing their bodies when they had to blocking a ton of shots and taking and dishing out a lot of hits too when the ball did get through samantha schmidt was there to hold down the fort

3573401 the development permit approved by council allows red mountain ventures to build the golf course providing they adhere to a number of conditions and get appropriate approvals from a number of other agencies eg ministry of environment department of fisheries and oceans ministry of health ministry of transportation etc
3573402 they would have to enter into an agreement with the ministry of tourism culture and the arts to amend the current operating agreement for the controlled recreation area in which they operate the ski hill to include operation of the golf course this would allow them to use crown land on which most of the golf course would be situated they would also have to acquire a piece of land which belongs to beaumont timber on which they propose to build four or five holes of their golf course

3573431 we already know that because of the heat wave in mclaren vale this year we will not have any velvet glove or carnival of love wines from 2008
3573432 this year it is even better because the fruit was so intense
3573433 we are very grateful that we have such a strong fan base in the united states

3573443 suggestion that there were political or partisan motivations in this case are misguided and incorrect
3573444 nonetheless just days before the july 15 primary handel a republican decided to ignore the ruling of the administrative law judge and remove powell from the ballot powell says he was never informed of that decision and learned of it only when he called handels staff to confirm a rumor that she had bounced him from the ballot
3573445 hello im and i would like to know why karen handel and the secretary of states office continues to fight against jim powell despite previous court rulings keeping him on the ballot these partisan divisive politics do not represent georgia values i would like to urge secretary handel to end this partisan battle and let georgians decide with their votes in november just as they did on july 15
3573446 we feel we have come to a fair agreement between both parties both parties shook hands
3573447 everyone we have spoken with has said that once the proposal is voted down you go back to the table
3573448 during the negotiation process things were going well and we were working together and then we started talking about money
3573449 how can i go back to the bargaining table when we have already come to a tentative agreement
3573450 three fourths of those involved the board its representatives and the mea bargaining unit have ratified the agreement and one fourth the teachers has not it is up to that one fourth to do that
3573451 that was an employer proposal it was not a tentative agreement
3573452 i never thought we would get to this point a point where the board would not talk to us and leave the start of the school year in question
3573453 its hard to believe in a town like massillon that has been union strong they wont even talk to us they are all about team and excitement but they are willing for teachers to go into the school year without a contract it doesnt make sense
3573454 they the court were all for us trying to work it out
3573455 if we dont come to a compromise the court will decide for everybody id rather work on a plan thats acceptable to everyone i think thats the better route to go
3573456 we are going to try and schedule a meeting with the neighborhood and show them all of this and see if we can come to some sort of a resolution as opposed to having the court decide
3573457 theyre trying to make everybody happy as opposed to shoving it down everyones throat
3573458 we have no returners up there weve got a ways to go right now weve got some guys too who have been dinged up who i think can help us youve got to have some depth there too i think were taking some small steps right now
3573459 brian arelt played an end there last year just to get him on the field and get our best 11 on
3573460 hes back at outside backer which i think is a better position for him
3573461 id like to if i have guys who can play
3573462 keith is pretty important on offense and so is matt
3573463 when pedro comes back that helps at tight end its tough you can play skill players both ways and i dont think its all that difficult up front its tough to have a two way player a two way starter its really difficult at this level
3573464 the kids and all the defensive coaches are working really hard with all the changes
3573465 some days are good and some days are bad because youre trying to get so much in during two a days sometimes the kids get overloaded with information and confused but overall theyve done a great job adapting and running the things were doing
3573466 most the time were going to have four down lineman but theyre not always going to be lined up in the same place
3573467 were going to have four linebackers lined up behind them in different positions at different times thats just the shell though because we run a lot of different things off of it
3573468 the way we do it there are going to be multiple front looks based on who were playing i dont know how much were going to be lined up in a base 4 4 defense but everything we do will stem from our 4 4 defense
3573469 size isnt always the most important thing because were always on the move and were not in the same place very often we want kids who can move pretty well and get to the football
3573470 were more of a pressure defense this season were going to attack and theres really not much sitting and reading involved
3573471 we have almost all of our defensive package in right now
3573472 i just want to take it one step at a time
3573473 i want to win sectionals and then districts i want to get to the big stage and win state my ultimate goal this season is to win state thats what youve got to do just say it and put it into existence
3573474 i was so pumped our team got the win at the federal league preseason tournament tuesday
3573475 were actually really close were as close a team as you can get we all have fun with each other on the bus its going to be a real fun year and not one guy is singled out all of us are having fun
3573476 its every golf coachs dream based on his consistent play over the last few years its just nice thing to be able to have as a coach
3573477 coach jackson has been there and done that he knows what its like to have a solid steady career i want to thank him and hes done an awesome job its a privilege to have him as a coach
3573478 i hope it just fires them up to say yeah lets just go play well i think they like the competition and they want to do good and get better i just try to put a good example in
3573479 the really neat thing is to see the support from the other members of the team as they are improving its neat to see that today
3573480 im not going to go into my senior season thinking its the last year and im going to have to make it a standout season
3573481 im just going to play the game and have fun with it everything else will take care of itself i just want to have a fun year
3573482 if he doesnt feel comfortable with something he doesnt try to over do it he plays within his limits hes not afraid to put the driver in the bag when he needs to he just takes what the course gives him
3573483 oh my god heather barmore you want stories about heather barmore oooh shit pull up a chair and relax a little because i have some stories for you
3573484 that said i dont want to deal with people hurting my feelings because i look at blogging as my fun and safe space and i really just dont want bullshit for myself or for anyone else its really that simple
3573485 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3573486 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet
3573487 kansas ranked 63 overall in my special teams rankings last year marcus herford was an oustanding kick returner guaranteeing ku starting field position of at least the 30 or 35 he returns for 2008 i swear hes been at ku since at the rest of the unit however was average at best they were 109 in net punting and 103 in punt returns and as mizzou fans can attest scott webb wasnt the most reliable of kickers he was better than he showed against mizzou but he was still only above average at best both webb and punter kyle tucker are gone and while neither is a tremendous loss they still have to find capable replacements and nobody on the roster has kicked punted at the d1 level
3573488 the re conviction rate for prisoners who have been through this drug treatment programme is 13 percent lower than for untreated prisoners
3573489 when you consider that 60 percent of offenders are affected by alcohol or other drugs at the time of their offending and a staggering 83 percent have abused alcohol or drugs at some point in their lives the positive impact of such programmes on the overall safety of communities is clear
3573490 the course is not an easy option to be eligible prisoners must be motivated to confront their addiction and accept the need to do something about it
3573491 she eva asked victoria to come on board and help
3573492 before the downpour let me just say that my new movie my best friends girl is the best funniest film ive done yet
3573493 that being said let me address the fact that although im not a marketing major i have a bit of a trusted reputation after 18 years self promoting id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in
3573494 it is a first i guess they are going after the insomniac vote
3573495 it is a very logical thing to do and hopefully it will assuage concerns of leading players and make up their minds to come here
3573496 its a very interesting time consumer video chat is now really front and center entering the mass market
3573497 the next big thing in im is to add voice and video
3573498 three weeks ago it was 4 77 you can put the numbers to it its a heckuva difference thats half a truck payment right there
3573499 when i was unveiled i said i was not counting on him but i also said we would treat him as any other player
3573500 during the past two three weeks the past month that we have been together i have been very pleased with his performance i only have words of praise
3573501 quando n o houver mais espa o no inferno os mortos tomar o a terra
3573502 no matter what youve done for yourself or for humanity if you cant look back on having given love and attention to your own family what have you really accomplished
3573503 good family life is never an accident but always an achievement by those who share it
3573504 i believe this article highlights why youre writing for a small town newspaper
3573505 this business is what have you done for me lately
3573506 as romeo says the young guys have to prove they can do it and the old guys have to prove they still have it
3573507 he can play center right guard left guard hes on special teams
3573508 hes not the biggest guy but he knows technique he understands positioning hell give you everything hes got and hes very smart
3573509 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3573510 georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3573511 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3573512 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3573513 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3573514 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3573515 im not sure how we top britney opening the show
3573516 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
3573517 has been circled on my calendar for about two years now
3573518 weve got veterans were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last three years getting ready for this moment
3573519 so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
3573520 we were not looking ahead i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
3573521 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things the main thing was just to keep some consistency so overall i was very pleased with tonight
3573522 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3573523 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3573524 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3573525 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3573526 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3573527 if youre not involved in the sport im not sure you can fully appreciate it
3573528 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3573529 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3573530 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3573531 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3573532 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning
3573533 when i lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3573534 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3573535 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community
3573536 but i detest the part of him that did what hes done i cant fathom it its evil
3573537 were happy with the verdict and feel that society will be protected for a little while
3573538 it is truly unfortunate that rex johnson got himself into this dilemma
3573539 a change in leadership at this time is not only unhealthy but also unsound
3573540 we are proud to work at the hta and we are proud to work for rex johnson
3573541 suspended for 10 days rather than terminated for grabbing an employee and ripping his shirt this was an incident of workplace violence that many people felt he deserved more
3573542 this is a place we tell people its great for families and to have our head of tourism authority distributing pornography over a government computer is a challenge
3573543 i do want to address the many recent comments in the paper of this being the wrong time to make a move or change in hta leadership because of the support the industry has received from the current director please know that this view is not the majority of the industry but there is a reluctance to speak out due to the legislative support that he has gotten
3573544 the industry will survive fine there is a good team on the ground and i believe we can find the appropriate leadership needed
3573545 it does not help us to think about how others have it worse off when were going through our own trauma we can only go by our own experience so what may be petty to others can be rightfully major to us

3573550 we decided to seek at the encouragement of dr curtis a second opinion
3573551 lindsay went to dr matthew hudder who is an expert on hcm at the harvard medical center after another series of tests dr hudder also concluded that lindsay was at a very high risk
3573552 out of the 400 plus physicals we conducted this year lindsay is one of the most fit and conditioned athletes that we have at usf
3573553 but she does have a family history of the thickened heart walls
3573554 lindsay will probably live a fine life with little to no complications
3573555 but she is at a high level of risk when she exerts herself
3573556 the university and its staff can be credited with saving lindsays life
3573557 they have stepped up their standards in looking for medical conditions with their athletes not all universities are doing ekgs on their student athletes we are at the cutting edge with that
3573558 you dont even try i am so proud of lindsay and the way she has handled herself in this tough situation she has demonstrated such courage and maturity she is a true inspiration to everyone around her she is a great player and an even better person
3573559 shes dedicated so much to our team having her on the field with us was such a great asset we want to be able to give her something by playing our season in honor of her
3573560 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3573561 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3573562 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3573563 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3573564 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3573565 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3573566 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3573567 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3573568 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3573569 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3573570 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3573571 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way
3573572 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all
3573573 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3573574 its been awhile since coach mike nolan has said anything to us about it
3573575 i wish we were in the light a little bit i guess thats how it is
3573576 hes a little more relaxed and comfortable with what were doing the other guys will come along
3573577 were letting j t go at it here a little bit and well see how he does
3573578 little bit better command of the huddle and line of scrimmage of the offense
3573579 its up to the coaches and up to the quarterbacks to separate themselves
3573580 you want to say youre constantly getting better with it but unfortunately there are going to be days
3573581 the three of us arent sure at times whats going on
3573582 i try not to worry about that or read into that
3573583 the more you do that the more its going to hurt you and your play
3573584 but im trying to keep a good attitude and wait for my chance again
3573585 i was just emptying some stuff out of a car and i thought i saw a rubber snake
3573586 we have a double whammy today with both heavyweight sectors under pressure
3573587 we had commodity prices down overnight so the resources sector has been hit very hard and the financials are also down
3573588 i dont know how i can ever say that i am sorry
3573589 i will be sorry for the rest of my life

3573644 i think many who dont come from an evangelical context may miss the point it is a professionally cut edited and produced ad full of sinister dog whistles for evangelical ears at best it is suggesting supporters of obama are idol worshipers at its worst it is suggesting that sen obama is some kind of anti christ

3573756 o crit rio do vuaden problema dele pois falta deve ser marcada sempre o jogo fica perigoso quando isso n o acontece eu entendo que muitos atletas priorizavam uma falta a uma jogada mas agora estamos cometendo um excesso na outra ponta
3573757 eu sofri cinco ou seis p naltis durante a partida n o sei se persegui o contra o corinthians mas novamente n o marcaram
3573758 eu conhe o o herrera se fosse um jogador considerado cai cai que prefere a falta ao gol eu n o iria reclamar da dist ncia em que eu estava n o posso dizer se foi p nalti mas considerando o meu jogador tenho certeza que ele n o ia se atirar na marca do p nalti aos 47 minutos ele teria chutado e marcado o gol
3573759 foi um prova boa mas acho que n o entrei na final disputar uma prova que n o minha especialidade ajuda psicologicamente sempre bom at porque consegui fazer meus melhores tempos e vi que estou em boa forma
3573760 essa prova quase me mata do cora o quase n o encostei o p na virada foi uma prova bem ruim e ainda bem que passei para a final para poder nadar bem melhor
3573761 n o gostei do resultado criamos muitas chances e n o conseguimos converter em gol agora ficou complicado sabemos que a competi o mata mata mas vamos para s o paulo buscar nossa classifica o

3573816 when youre a kid you think to yourself fame and fortune and its going to be so exciting and but then you quickly find after three or four films you find wait a minute the upside is nothing and the downside is nothing the adulation of the multitudes or of the critics is an impersonal experience and the negative feelings from people is an impersonal experience the contract that the audience has with the person is you entertain us and well show up and that is as the contract should be
3573817 i always wanted to make the kinds of films that i saw in the 1950s the truffaut films and the goddard films and the bergmans and fellinis and those are the films that always influenced my work and ive always copied them and been influenced by them vicky cristina barcelona looks to me when i see it like one of those films its got all the earmarks the music the people bicycling through europe the interaction of the characters and the out of focus scenes that you see in those pictures
3573818 barcelona is a city that i can live in very easily
3573819 if they mentioned some city in the ukraine or the sudan or something i would have said no but barcelona is a beautiful wonderful city
3573820 and when i saw her i thought my god shes if you can believe this more beautiful in person than she is on the screen i thought she was so beautiful it took my breath away
3573821 i would have given her all the furniture you know
3573822 i thought ok i have these two great tempestuous spaniards and barcelona but i dont have a film
3573823 if there are no parts for me then i just wont play any and if theres a lovable character named gramps who you know was wise beyond his years you know then
3573824 im not like dustin hoffman or robert de niro these guys go out and do miracles on the screen im a perfectly believable actor in my small range so i can play a college professor i can play a shrink i could play an intellectual even though im not an intellectual or i can play a lowlife i can play like broadway danny rose or i could play a cheesy little bookmaker or a grifter of some sort because i can handle that me the character for real is closer to the sleaze ball but i can act both of them
3573825 i always feel like i am doing the same process all the time i dont make them any differently
3573826 i dont feel any sense of liberation in europe i dont feel that i make happy films when im happy and sad films when im sad i dont feel i make autobiographical films i was not particularly happy or going through a good time of life when i made take the money and run and bananas those are two of my most silly comic films whereas when i made cassandras dream and match point i was going through a very wonderful time of life these have been very good years for me i have a great marriage great kids there is no plan or agenda to it or anything its luck its random
3573827 its a way of coping with the world you know in the same way that somebody copes with it by being a stamp collector or a sports addict or a titan of industry or an alcoholic or something my way of coping with the horrors of existence is to put my nose to the grindstone and work and not look up

3573831 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3573832 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3573833 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way

3573865 he calls a special session on education without a plan any ideas on education and i just think its appalling
3573866 we were hopeful that lawmakers could have started a dialogue on finding some education funding solutions today but that has not happened and we are disappointed by the lack of action to this point

3573902 with all of the mixed messages we hear about biofuels there is a clear need for a standard that can differentiate the good from the bad
3573903 for an issue of such seminal importance it was necessary to bring many different stakeholder groups together to agree on how to define and measure sustainable biofuels
3573904 i didnt know anything about it until juan pierre said he took all his bats and went on in
3573905 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3573906 i was sitting there when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3573907 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3573908 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3573909 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3573910 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can

3573912 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3573913 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3573914 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3573915 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3573916 there was a lot of stuff that happened in cleveland there were stories about him you know what if i told all the stories about him and the funny things that happened you and i might be sitting here and laughing this time tomorrow thats who he is when i used to talk hitting with him id say youve got to be tension free and actually manny is tension free in life thats something that comes natural for him

3573918 the picture appears bleak right across the board mr fletcher said
3573919 its a big concern particularly as dubbo has had a hell of a hiding following prolonged drought for many years

3573924 things will have to change before the predicted recession is over
3573925 hard times reinforce opportunities in regional australia particularly as the cost of living continues to rise in the metropolitan and coastal locations mr mawbey said
3573926 theres all the more reason for pro development organisations like grow dubbo to work hard

3573944 a designer who neglects marketing concerns and designs a product that the target audience sees as undesirable because for example it lacks a sexy list of features or a glossy interface is just as bad as a designer who neglects production concerns and creates something that is prohibitively expensive and time consuming to build to manufacture program whatever
3573945 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left
3573946 i just wanted to go out and gauge how i feel
3573947 i felt ok i just got some new stuff orthotics in my shoes and this is the first day i ran in them my feet are a little sore right now so its something i have to get used to once i get used to it and get the soreness out ill be back out here
3573948 he felt better and decided to do a few things
3573949 im not desperate but the issue down there is desperate
3573950 its a pennant race and you gotta try to do everything you can to remain in this race
3573951 you just have to learn to get ready quicker it would be fun id love to get a couple of saves why not
3573952 do you want to talk about your history with various forms of tobacco
3573953 worked with these people on several deals and they are to be avoided unless you are desperate
3573954 more realistic and ill settle for it if i cant attain the other
3573955 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3573956 save it for 2050 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america american to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today values of fairness compassion responsibility giving back
3573957 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3573958 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3573959 some things are best ended we are together as always
3573960 he spoke quite clearly and quite persuasively that he did not feel that he was in danger and that he wanted his wife home
3573961 its a tragedy no matter what everybodys hoping that the reasons for the death at least dont cause other problems
3573962 it appears from my vantage point as a horrible coincidence
3573963 my general perception is that any alleged foul play that would have happened that quickly would have been much more obvious
3573964 la raz n es que debemos poner el inter s nacional por sobre todas las cosas
3573965 look timmy there are even dinosaurs in heaven but there wont be any in hell only scientists go to hell
3573966 the image you use is a computed image not a photograph
3573967 such a law which is common in the muslim world wherever the radicals have control
3573968 assume would enforce your views of civil rights and human rights coercively
3573969 one on the path of moral self aggrandizement and self congratulation
3573970 oppression is okay as long as it happens to foreign people
3573971 lacks the concept of a separation between church and state
3573972 upon perceiving that islam is today used for bloody purposes and christianity is not you conclude that this has not something to do with this particular moment in history but rather something to do with the
3573973 no youre right that is nuts and there are ni comparable christian countries
3573974 so lets hear from the cultural relativists who stop by whenever i criticize another country for such policies
3573975 oppression is okay as long as it happens to foreign people
3573976 oh were some hot sh t and youd be hot sh t too if only you saw the world the same because i told you to see it that way
3573977 directing criticism toward others is always a way of avoiding self criticism even if only for the moment
3573978 im on my bike probably four or five times a week doing between 35 40 kilometres every time
3573979 i like to get out front early and keep a steady pace throughout the race
3573980 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat valley and in the tribal areas we will continue this
3573981 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3573982 by the time im 70 years old the northeastern part of the united states will be as hot as florida if we dont make any changes in the way we are living
3573983 i dont think people realize how hot florida and other warmer places like arizona will become some locations may become inhabitable its a bit of an eye opener
3573984 we were astounded at the lengths that some colleges were going to make their campuses greener
3573985 at lycoming we plan on installing permanent recycling containers in all buildings use the food waste from the cafeteria as compost for a local farm and possibly experiment with making and using bio diesel fuel for vehicles
3573986 most of the colleges at the conference already have solar panels and other sustainable practice in place on their campuses
3573987 at lycoming we are hoping to receive a grant to add solar panels somewhere on campus
3573988 our hope is that these students and professors will go on to become solar champions
3573989 we want to see renewable energy become an even bigger part of university programs and instruction
3573990 support for renewable electricity helps to protect the environment and strengthen our nations energy supply
3573991 this initiative will help raise awareness about solar energy among tomorrows leaders
3573992 the addition of solar energy to any business is a great investment
3573993 although panels are a little pricey to install they pay themselves off in energy prices in only a few months most of the time you will find that people are impressed and more interested in working with or applying to a business or college that has established itself as a green facility i think that people are finally realizing that something needs to change before its too late and adding solar panels to a business or college is only working in the right direction
3573994 it was a life changing experience learning about not just solar energy but sustainability as well
3573995 i think everyone should have the kind of insight that was given to me there it makes you want to change the world
3573996 after attending the solar scholars conference and seeing how passionate people are about renewable energy i think i want to choose a career that consists of bettering the environment or at least raising awareness that our ecosystem is in trouble
3573997 this conference really opens your eyes and helps to put your college experience in perspective would you rather coast along and accept that people dont want to be bothered by recycling or turning the lights off to save energy or do you want to make a definite change in your campus
3573998 on my own time im taking care of women who have a need and im going to continue to deliver babies

3574043 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster
3574044 i live in ohio i desperately desire a mini diesel in fact my next car will either be a diesel or a series hybrid with electric motor and generator range extender as the second option unfortunately remains a dream at this point i will be buying a diesel my question is will i be buying a mini diesel because if you offer it in the united states ohio specifically i will buy one otherwise i will likely end up with a vw or a honda in 2009 i want to buy now but i am going to wait until a car is available that meets my desire for a clean great fuel economy diesel or plug in series hybrid with a internal combustion range extender you have a great car and a great diesel engine please make it available to us here in the us
3574045 thanks for writing mini i appreciate that you want to motor with lower costs and less emissions i am sorry to say mini division currently has no plans to bring a diesel version of the mini to the united states but we are looking into many new ideas for the future of mini please stay in touch with us through miniusa com for updates
3574046 in my opinion the increased mileage does not offset the disadvantages of noise reduced power smell and hard to find diesel fuel
3574047 we have no plans to bring diesel to the usa
3574048 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3574049 save it for 2050 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america american to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today values of fairness compassion responsibility giving back
3574050 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3574051 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3574052 the overwhelming majority of republican senators have pledged to protect october 1 as american energy freedom day so we can reduce dependence on foreign oil and lower the cost of gas at the pump
3574053 many people arent aware that the bans on drilling must be renewed every year and all we have to do is allow these prohibitions to expire on october 1 in just 50 days americans will have the freedom to pursue their own energy resources here at home our letter is very straightforward we will actively oppose any effort to extend the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale
3574054 if your life is not what you had hoped it would be you have no one to blame but yourself
3574055 if your life isnt want you wanted you have only yourselves to blame
3574056 once you are aware of the problem you are faced with the task of fixing it
3574057 to sin by silence when we should protest makes cowards out of men
3574058 we now know he voted against the state equivalent in the committee which he chaired of the federally passed
3574059 the president offered his support for the bill on 2002 mar 12 an identical bill sponsored by sen rick santorum r pa is was passed by the senate on 2002 jul 18
3574060 this important legislation ensures that every infant born alive including an infant who survives an abortion procedure is considered a person under federal law

3574063 we thought president musharrafs impeachment might not take place and if at all he has to go he will be allowed to go in grace and some sort of a compromise would be reached
3574064 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak afghan border but clearly our side of the border too like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
3574065 we are looking at a mastermind within the country one of the things we had hoped would not occur was that local elements would not get sucked into the worldwide movement of terrorists and al qaeda related activities
3574066 we have to find out if that organisation is localised or there is an external group or module that is operating there are several modules that we have disrupted some of these modules are not entirely foreign there have been 800 modules we have disrupted over the past four years all this indicates that much more high grade people are involved in the effort in jaipur cycles used for the blasts were bought from a series of shops the extent to which locals are involved whether they are mercenaries or part of the set up is what we are trying to unravel
3574067 last six months they put everything on hold next month we will be holding the talks we are working toward an agreed framework five or six points the more difficult points are settled
3574068 we have information that three people have been detained at jeddah airport but there is no official confirmation and neither has anyone approached us yet we are trying to check who the three are and what the purpose of their detention is through official sources and informers
3574069 this development complements our entries into china and the us giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world
3574070 our ability to access tescos retail knowledge and expertise will play an important role in our business their wholesale cash and carry business will provide us with the opportunity to tap into a world class supply chain thereby delivering the best of products and services to our customers
3574071 there were 33 processions today people were angry especially because of what happened yesterday there were four incidents of firing in srinagar city while forces opened fire at three other places we have exhibited maximum restraint two of our sub divisional police officers including a young ips officer an sho and 192 police and paramilitary force personnel were injured the protestors burnt three of our vehicles and damaged 33 other government vehicles
3574072 mimi look at this shirt it is sooo cool feel it i mean it feels like a surf board
3574073 man gage that shirt is so rad you should wear it all the time in fact you should take it to the airport in a bag and when you go in the bathroom change shirts and wear that awesome shirt all over the airport your mom will really like it i mean you look hot in that shirt

3574077 in hyderabad there wasnt much of a home advantage for us as the crowd turnout was little in delhi we expect the stadium to be packed and that will certainly help us
3574078 we wont have a better chance to qualify for the asian cup in the past one year we have played 27 matches and lost just three this shows that the team is in good form a win on wednesday will help raise footballs standard and it will certainly be a new beginning for the sport
3574079 in the wto contract until everything is agreed nothing is agreed
3574080 lamy sought a political message from the prime minister whether india wants to keep working or take time out
3574081 my simple message here in delhi and next week in washington is that members should look carefully at what is on the table and not on results
3574082 all the country did was to pile the pressure on rathore a medallist whos already achieved something for you and next time itll be abhinav bindra carrying that burden
3574083 shooting is where your medals are coming from rathore gave that first thrust and bindras gold has proven it beyond doubt
3574084 we need at least one world class shooting range in india befitting an olympic gold medal now
3574085 theres a reason why the sport gets expensive ranges in india arent equipped for modern day needs many date back to the infrastructure built in 1982 its obviously preferable to train abroad also we simply dont have as many coaches of calibre if mistakes seep into training early on which inevitably happens half your time is spent un learning that
3574086 people are falling over themselves to announce cash prizes to bindra now maybe some of them should also give cheques maybe one zero less to shooting ranges in their own state
3574087 true the next generation will not be as clueless as us in basic matters of what weapon what costume but if help doesnt come at the right time theyll take that much longer to make the jump from asian commonwealth to world and olympics
3574088 it has not changed me frankly all the attention is a bit overwhelming i am not much good at making loud public pronouncements that in no way means that this is not the most intense experience of my life
3574089 everyone who represents india at the olympic games has put in years of toil and sweat i ask the indian people to support our athletes more it is fine to celebrate our achievements but it is just as important to keep up the backing when we are not on top of our game
3574090 with our depth of talent and expanse of people i firmly believe india can be a world class sporting power what we need are precise systems

3574110 here is my issue with you you keep asking for proof for posting of pictures or links or sources you obviously have the internet if your really cared to know the answers to my response you would search it out for yourself you dont care to know you just want someone to argue with you call yourself an ex christian but i beg to differ i say you were never a true believer at all or that some person or ministry or church pissed you off enough to cause your bitterness and anger toward god if you did ever truly believe i did respond to the blog comments as far as i cared to your comments in answer to my question on the chimps had no basis for me to answer them i was done i asked you answered what more is there i dont believe it i dont agree so i stopped there you keep wanting me to say something more which leads me to believe that you just want to argue some more so you can feel like you have it all figured out and i am just some ignorant religious person making yourself feel good in your grasp for self worth and self esteem in your meaningless pointless existence of a life as laid out for you in your evolution religion it is not at all that i dont want to see what you are trying to show me it is the fact that i have seen enough of the evidence or lack thereof to reject evolution for the lie that it is and to say that i will see something that makes sense but will convince myself it does not is pure ignorance if something makes sense then it makes sense the issue here is that evolution does not add up nor make sense it is disprovable over and again you just refuse to see that are you afraid i am not afraid to talk to you about this as my replying proves i just refuse to argue with you about foolishness i suggest that you actually study like a student the bible so that you will actually have an understanding of its context languages history and backgrounds not just taking some ill religious experience you may have had or swallowing everything people tell you i could stand to learn more about evolution for knowings sake just the same as i could stand to increase my knowledge in other areas as well have a good night

3574154 it was all done as part of a days work much like the way early comic books were made they certainly werent made as art they werent sold as art and they werent thought of as art wacky packages just formed an island of subversive underground culture in the surrounding sea of junk
3574155 but god can you be a mother when your babys not with you

3574157 i just dont understand this god i want my baby to be here
3574158 i wish i could show you what your child is doing today if you could see your childs smile with all the other children and say
3574159 so you see my dear sweet ones your children are okay your babies are born here in my home and this is where theyll stay

3574163 its not going to be majorly different but hopefully the melodies will be nicer the guitar solos will be better the production will be better you just try to improve in every area
3574164 there isnt much to change but yet there is the last three albums have been very much guitar orientated and this one probably will be as well but i want to try to do some extra coloring in with the vocals

3574166 actually upon request by the broadcast operators of the olympics and in order to ensure the best broadcast quality for the opening ceremony we recorded our music beforehand and used recordings at the opening ceremony
3574167 we decided to let lin maoke to sing on the stage and to use yang peiyis voice necause yang peiyi has the best voice while lin miaoke is the best actress
3574168 we indeed set off the footprint shaped fireworks in different locations in beijing from south to north in real time but for a part of it what the audience saw on tv was actually a video clip that we pre recorded the weather was not good and it would have influenced the effect of the fireworks from a visual perspective
3574169 i dont hate the chinese at all but i do have the personal opinion it is a country that has a foundation built on deception comment by no china bashing

3574176 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3574177 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3574178 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned

3574184 ab 2899 will revolutionize the way we do hiv testing in california and we strongly urge the governor to sign this bill
3574185 today in government funded programs extensive education and counseling is required for every person regardless of how many times they might have been tested treating the young person who is testing for the first time the same as a person in their forties or fifties who has been tested dozens of times doesnt make sense this important reform will allow ahf the largest hiv tester in california to do three times as many tests per hour as we do now the unanimous approval of the legislature for this common sense approach to hiv testing is very encouraging
3574186 this bill brings the requirements for hiv counseling in line with where we are today in our knowledge and understanding of hiv aids and other stds and it will allow us to focus our counseling efforts where they are most needed to those at high risk and those who may test positive
3574187 the california legislature has recognized the importance of this prudent public health legislation with its unanimous passage in both chambers when this bill is chaptered into law it will allow the department of public health and the state office of aids far more flexibility in its counseling regulations to best serve and reflect the needs of communities throughout california

3574229 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3574230 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3574231 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3574232 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3574233 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like its from another time
3574234 yeah i cant get any good ol fashioned american beer but at least them funny europeans didnt take it from my cold dead hands
3574235 at 115 a barrel we see the industry turning a profit in 2009
3574236 if sustained is a game changing event for the industry
3574237 der gegner war nicht irgendwer das war immerhin nordkorea wir sind zweiter geworden in einer hammergruppe mit sieben punkten gegen brasilien nigeria und nordkorea darauf k nnen wir aufbauen leider haben wir uns heute das leben selbst schwer gemacht

3574239 if were going to compete internationally for the best and for the brightest we need to improve the way that we attract and retain those who want to work in their fields and contribute to canadian society
3574240 theyre good enough to work here but we dont want them to become canadian citizens
3574241 thats 90 per cent of the 165 000 temporary foreign workers who are working in canada right now
3574242 with nearly full employment an aging population and skill shortages there is an immediate need to ensure canadian employers can access the skills they need

3574244 la movilidad propuesta abarca a todos los montos y todos los jubilados de la argentina y si el texto es poco feliz habr que modificarlo

3574252 when these things happen its like a military intervention if they need to fly someone from houston on a private jet theyll do it theres almost no cost that will be too great to get this refinery operating again
3574253 there are lots of incentives for the operators of the refinery to get it going and up to snuff and producing again because the lost sales dont get recovered
3574254 youd think that all else being equal less supply into the market would result in a little bit of an increase in price because there might be just a little bit more demand compared to supply
3574255 but even having said that we have price wars and prices go up and down for various reasons and something going to counter that increasing price is that in the last couple of months canadians have been driving less than last year because of other increases
3574256 finishes off the gasoline before it gets out to market
3574257 without the cat cracker its like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer you just cant produce the finished product and get it out there
3574258 when you look at the size of the area that prices are based on its a huge area and most of it is driven by what happens in the united states
3574259 when you look at the types of volumes youre dealing with its massive so something like this would be a minor flip
3574260 there are times when i just cant stop eating i feel awful after but at the time i just want another cookie and another until they are all gone or ill intend to take a few bites of ice cream out of the carton and find myself unable to stop until the whole carton is gone i just dont get why im still doing this and it seems worse since i married roger even though i really love him i just cant figure this out
3574261 well sometimes i just feel so empty and alone inside i just cant stand it the food makes me feel so much better i dont feel so lonely when im eating and filled up but i dont get why i feel this way im not alone i have roger and he loves me
3574262 it sounds like you want to eat when you feel alone inside when your inner child which is your feeling self feels alone and abandoned inside
3574263 thats exactly what i feel but i have no idea how to fill that emptiness and aloneness without food and why do i feel alone inside when im not alone outside
3574264 hannah while he is holding you imagine the child part of you that wants to overeat imagine that you are holding her while your grandfather is holding you ask her how you are treating her that causes her to feel so empty and alone
3574265 the thing you always do that i just hate is you just go along with everything that roger wants what he wants and needs and feels is always more important to you than i am you dont speak up for me every since we got married its like roger is supposed to make me happy instead of you making me happy i need you to make me happy by taking care of me instead of taking care of roger so that roger will love us i need you to love me

3574275 cuando un pap quiere que su hijo juegue organiza el equipo para que el nene no se quede sin jugar algo as est pasando en el ppr en ese partido lo organiz y lo hizo todo rogelio y ser a injusto decirle que se eche a un lado para que le d el honor de ser candidato a otro que ha trabajado menos que l
3574276 dej de ser una opci n en el momento en que se convirti en el partido de rogelio lo convirti en algo suyo y no estamos buscando a un protector ambiental sino una nueva alternativa a lo que existe
3574277 ese partido en ning n momento fue una opci n se ve como un capricho personal de rogelio figueroa es un partido sin estructura sin liderato en los municipios
3574278 fue una estrategia para crear la impresi n de que eran un partido con presencia nacional
3574279 lo que acaba de pasar es una hecatombe pol tica de una instituci n natimuerta
3574280 institucionalmente es el reflejo de cu n r pido un partido pol tico absorbe la personalidad tradicional de los otros partidos pol ticos obviamente todo esto ha sido consecuencia de la arrogancia e intransigencia de los s ndicos de ese partido en el caso de las cinco personas que fueron expulsadas por apoyar a ferdinand p rez
3574281 yo nunca fui candidato simpatizaba con las cuestiones del ambiente y me preguntaron si quer a ser candidato como un favor en lo que consegu an a un candidato
3574282 yo era candidato suplente realmente estaba en lo que consegu an a un candidato para la sustituci n
3574283 necesito seguir unos tratamientos hacer campa a es duro pero yo sigo con el partido rogelio figueroa es un excelente candidato honrado y trabajador
3574284 no me gustan los dimes y diretes y prefer renunciar para proteger mi privacidad
3574285 no tengo el tiempo y el factor econ mico afect tambi n
3574286 estoy criando a mis dos hijos y para m ahora mi prioridad es mi familia sigo apoyando a rogelio y creo en los postulados del partido

3574288 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3574289 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3574290 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3574291 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3574292 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3574293 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3574294 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3574295 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3574296 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3574297 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3574298 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3574299 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3574300 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3574301 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3574302 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3574303 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3574304 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3574305 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3574306 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3574307 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners
3574308 oh god another awkward encounter with sabrinas mother what the hell
3574309 i told her to leave it but she insisted that we paid for half sorry
3574310 he told me you told me to do this well i can understand why he thought that but thats fine
3574311 we dont want to turn pixar into a live action studio in fact the intent is that the special effects will not be done at pixar
3574312 theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
3574313 i think its very simple weve been devastated by injuries
3574314 no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester pitching is 70 percent of the game wang won 19 games two straight years chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3574315 i know that weve had a lot of injuries but i still believe that this team is good enough to win
3574316 were going to work it through we have a lot of tough series against a lot of tough opponents but you cant look at that youve just got to trust your club today
3574317 if we need to add a top veteran pitcher well do that well do whatever we need to do next year well be extremely dangerous
3574318 i think i pitched three times a week sometimes more than that
3574319 it was completely stupid i dont give the blame away i take most of it myself
3574320 it was kind of reserved for college or professional players and now we definitely see a lot of high schoolers that are coming in with ulnar collateral ligament tears
3574321 ive seen what i believe are arm problems in younger kids in the 11 and 12 year old range
3574322 it used to be pretty rare it was kind of reserved for college or professional players and now we definitely see a lot of high schoolers that are coming in with ulnar collateral ligament tears
3574323 those professionals who certainly understand the physiological aspect of kids playing the game were saying that kids were throwing too much pitchers were being overused
3574324 at young ages theyre just not mature enough and strong enough yet physically to maintain the rigors of throwing like they might when they get college or even in the professional ranks
3574325 as you get older and you have muscle control and your arm is stronger you can then start working in things like sliders and curveballs
3574326 to put that onus on an umpire behind the plate whos also a volunteer could be quite difficult
3574327 it was an annoying pain but i knew it would go away it didnt ruin my day
3574328 being so young i was kinda attracted to being the all star
3574329 not only was i playing in too many leagues i wasnt getting my rest
3574330 when i was pitching for one team my day of rest for that team was pitching for another team
3574331 it wont affect anything i feel comfortable over there i feel comfortable at third base whatever they want
3574332 i told him yesterday youre our third baseman dont worry about second just play third
3574333 thats what i told him whether or not that stuck in there i dont know
3574334 i dont think i really want to address that right now
3574335 i know i have to come to the park and play hard every day
3574336 jose is having a heck of a year and making strides defensively
3574337 there is a phrase that you hear in football more than baseball you cant take plays off you owe it to your teammates
3574338 i was real disappointed in our play saturday night an 8 7 11 inning loss and let them know about it after the game
3574339 i felt we came out sunday with a little lack of focus on defense we started the game with a popup that dropped then that play by lopez that goes into center field
3574340 i decided you know what this is for everybody they all have to get the message i made that change replacing lopez with tug hulett and hopefully that wont happen again
3574341 instead of openly like that but you want to see the results of a postgame talk to the team you want to see a change i think jose understands and time will tell he is a very talented player and i dont want this to be a distraction
3574342 it has been dealt with and its time to move on
3574343 and thats a hard thing over a 162 game schedule it probably doesnt sound tough to the average fan but you watch almost any major league game and youll see someone jog down the line you see it on first place clubs but it goes by the wayside because they are in first place
3574344 i believe that chris should be taken into the leadership he should take over as treasurer and also leader of government business because i think that hes a very sensible person hes a very fair person and hes certainly needed in the the leadership team
3574345 n s temos um manual que regula as nossas opera es e determina que o preso tem de ser algemado e n o deve ser exposto e foi isso o que ocorreu hoje
3574346 depois que voc fala que uma pessoa est presa voc n o sabe o que passa na cabe a dela n o sabe como ela vai reagir ent o para a seguran a dele e do policial a cela inicial do preso
3574347 perante a sociedade o uso das algemas j os condenou n o havia necessidade alguma desta medida meus clientes s o servidores p blicos federais n o oferecem perigo algum
3574348 o filho de um dos suspeitos me disse que o pai foi preso em casa estava tranq ilo e n o resistiu foi algemado mesmo assim havia necessidade para mim a pf n o concordou com a decis o do stf e por pirra a resolveu que iria manter a conduta de sempre
3574349 damn i wish i had a teacher like that when i was 14
3574350 according to an article released by the air force times just before noon the usaf is preparing an airlift operation into georgia first reports did not indicate whether the airlift was to be humanitarian supplies or logistics for the georgian army
3574351 rose revolution of a former soviet satellite president bush addressed thousands filling
3574352 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone americans respect your courageous choice for liberty and as you build a free and democratic georgia the american people will stand with you
3574353 before there was a purple revolution in iraq or an orange revolution in ukraine or a cedar revolution in lebanon there was the rose revolution in georgia bush said to the cheering crowd in tbilisi three years ago
3574354 your courage is inspiring democratic reformers and sending a message that echos across the world freedom will be the future of every nation and every people on earth
3574355 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3574356 most institutions think we are currently in the most dangerous period for global financial services firms
3574357 the nypds latest plan to track and monitor the movements of millions of law abiding people is an assault on this countrys historical respect for the right to privacy and the freedom to be left alone
3574358 that this is happening without public debate and that elected officials have had no opportunity to study this program is even more alarming
3574359 another interesting aspect is seeing how certain countries are what i call cyberlocked
3574360 we know a landlocked country has no access to the sea countries like ge georgia might rely too heavily on one or a handful of connections potentially through hostile countries eg ru russia for their physical connectivity
3574361 in a historic first estonia is sending cyberdefense advisors to georgia
3574362 its still very difficult to get a call anywhere around the country right now
3574363 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
3574364 the disclosure is the latest example of what critics assert is the bush administrations politicizing of government decisions
3574365 fell short of the categorical retraction of the imputation of anti semitism that i insisted upon
3574366 i think all chinas viewers and listeners should understand that was a matter of national interest
3574367 coming from fiji its been a goal of mine to try and make it into the waikato team so being named today is really an honour and im really proud to be part of this team
3574368 i made a brief appearance against wellington and came in for trainings now and again which was an eye opener for me having just watched them a month earlier on tv back in fiji
3574369 even now im still buzzing to be with the likes of liam messam and other big players like that but this year i knew what i had to do and that i had to either front up or lose my spot
3574370 were actually putting guys where theyre comfortable and it gives us a bit of a fresh look going into this week
3574371 come come whoever you are worshiper wanderer lover of leaving ours is not a caravan of despair though you have broken your vows a thousand times come come again come
3574372 i just think its a tragedy for this region its a tragedy for young players and for all the aspiration thats out there
3574373 if any of these guys have an aspiration to play at a higher level than heartland rugby then theyre going to have to move away arent they we could be talking about 20 to 30 players and that to me is the sad part of it all
3574374 were getting told the third week into this competition that were not going to be there next season that alone is a distraction the players will have a lot on their minds where is their future where is their career going to be
3574375 i dont think a lot of good comes out of negative motivation and weve got a really good team here weve got really good people here and we just need to keep our pride and our dignity thats something theyll never be able to take away from us
3574376 id like to stay in the crusaders environment so canterbury is probably the only place to go
3574377 things were just starting to roll along quite well now and now its been taken away from all the players and the younger guys who are coming up weve got a few new guys in the team this year and theres a lot of good talent around the tasman region
3574378 im not too sure what im going to be doing next season because i head over to the uk after the air new zealand cup so i wont be making any decisions until january or february
3574379 it doesnt really give the kids in this region and upcoming talent anything to aspire to its a shame really but we cant do a hell of a lot about it weve just got to keep playing
3574380 which is a pity because i dont really want to go anywhere else
3574381 ive just got to keep playing and hopefully get an opportunity somewhere else
3574382 but im pretty gutted to be honest im really enjoying this place
3574383 she is a very dangerous person no doubt about it
3574384 this is a major haul a major capture for the fbi
3574385 to find someone who has such rich information computer hard drives e mails that is really a major capture
3574386 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3574387 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody
3574388 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3574389 were proud of our role as americas first line of defense against foreign animal diseases
3574390 were equally proud of our safety record not once in our nearly 50 years of operation has an animal pathogen escaped from the island
3574391 we know that he has been involved in terrorist planning with senior al qaeda leaders overseas and has scouted sites across america that might be vulnerable to terrorist attack
3574392 the warrant officer saw and heard siddique fire at least two shots as interpreter 1 tried to wrestle the gun from her no one was hit the warrant officer heard siddique exclaim allah akbar another interpreter interpreter 2 heard siddique yell in english get the f out of here as she fired the rifle
3574393 her medical condition is that she was shot in the abdomen there are stitches that run from the breast plate area down to the belly button area layers and layers of tissue have been sewn sutured we have heard reports that she has lost a kidney we dont know if those are accurate but we are concerned about that there has been intestinal damage part of the intestines we understand have been removed
3574394 in brightest day in blackest night no evil shall escape my sight let those who worship evils might beware my power green lanterns light
3574395 adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
3574396 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3574397 i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3574398 can you name the elements in the periodic table in 15 minutes
3574399 uranium is not such a dangerous material as uranium oxide its a very very low concentration
3574400 there is no way in hell im going to get any of these
3574401 i believe that chris should be taken into the leadership he should take over as treasurer and also leader of government business because i think that hes a very sensible person hes a very fair person and hes certainly needed in the the leadership team
3574402 were not going to negotiate with a gun to our just stupid
3574403 i dont think we know yet what the consumer wants
3574404 what has happened to this place im never coming back
3574405 i love five points i cant wait to come again and bring all my friends
3574406 edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3574407 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air
3574408 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go
3574409 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3574410 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
3574411 ooh do you mean the olympics are just so you guys can ogle wom
3574412 edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3574413 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3574414 im going to get them into the lineup whether its for fukudome or anybody else
3574415 they need to play too theyve done a nice job here
3574416 were pulling for him ive never said i was disappointed all ive said basically was that wed like to see him start hitting and it created a stir
3574417 to his credit hes continued to hustle and hes played really well in right field hes just in a little bit of a slump probably trying to do too much
3574418 he needs just to do the things that hes capable of like he was earlier in the year hes taking less pitches hes not working the count the way he was earlier he just needs to swing at more strikes
3574419 you try to find somebody else thats swinging the bat
3574420 it created a stir and if thats the case im sorry
3574421 and you know what he probably is but i think we give him one more and then we put him back into the closers role
3574422 when russia moved in on georgia john mccain stood up immediately and told them to get out
3574423 so he is really the man for the job at this critical time in world history
3574424 i respect senator obamas views and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now
3574425 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent
3574426 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3574427 its time to hear the roar of a strong american economy again and stop from shipping our jobs overseas
3574428 but taking over the offense that happens later right now im just trying to get into the groove get everything clicking and get everyone on the same page
3574429 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition
3574430 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
3574431 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
3574432 it has all the makings of a real good line
3574433 were all trying to get the chemistry this camp so we can work well heading into the season
3574434 somewhere along the line out of those seven or eight guys weve got to get four guys who can start and others who can come in and play
3574435 were going to try to do what we did two years ago with dan wagner brendan st peter and marvin wright inside and on the outside trying to get three of them in a rotation
3574436 the opener is definitely going to fly by and be here before we know it
3574437 but the key is you cant look ahead 3 weeks youve got to focus on getting better and better day by day
3574438 its a lot faster im still getting used to college football and everything that comes with it
3574439 im looking forward to traveling with the team since i didnt get to last year
3574440 this offseason i was along with 60 other guys up here and its different it was a good bonding experience with the team and we got a lot of work done

3574520 we have a very clear knowledge of this and are placing the stones next to the old reef effectively extending it there is no damage

3574525 we would hope that some of the decisions might be reconsidered
3574526 there have been many moments at the iwc this year when debate was not directly linked to stocks
3574527 while some species have started to recover none of them are back to the levels they had before industrial whaling started
3574528 overall nearly a quarter of cetacean species are considered threatened nine species are listed as endangered or critically endangered
3574529 since that location is among the 24 wetlands we have in nigeria and along the two migratory routes we suspect that the strain could have come from the migratory birds
3574530 there are costs to adapting to climate change by planning now we can reduce our exposure to weather related events

3574554 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back

3574557 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can

3574588 la falta de inteligencia del imperio norteamericano en su af n de desvirtuar a los gobiernos revolucionarios tal es el caso de nicaragua
3574589 c mo se les ocurre traer a pol ticos fracasados si tuvieran inteligencia debieron de traer a gente que logr resultados para mejorar la vida de sus pueblos pero pol ticos fracasados que destruyeron inclusive a su pa s eso solamente me puede causar risa
3574590 hay mucho en riesgo en este momento aqu en nicaragua

3574612 he left here just before five to go to ulladulla to do repairs on a truck
3574613 i was coming down the hill when i saw three young kids walking south on the northbound side of the road which i thought was a bit suspicious
3574614 ive been in road service for over 10 years and you dont see people walking on that side of the road towards you at night

3574626 people are just trying to comfort themselves against the thought of a killer walking the streets
3574627 we have an amazing number of community groups and volunteers who work tirelessly in the area
3574628 it is wonderful to be able to give these valuable community members the chance to be recognised and to celebrate all their efforts
3574629 it was a great opportunity for community representatives to meet others who volunteer their time and to network
3574630 the night was a great success and we were happy to be able to host the evening
3574631 im amazed at how many people dont know whats happening
3574632 this extraordinary level of funding swamped the financial capacity of any individual or group running in the election

3574699 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3574937 im one member of the downtown music scene was introduced to her as she walked up fourth avenue with the strokes manager ryan gentles
3574938 she was super pale and had that look of someone you know but not in a famous way
3574939 it was like does that girl date a friend of mine and have i met her at their birthday
3574940 she hasnt been around here in like a year and then she was nowhere and then she just shows up in new york being seen every single night
3574941 shes going to like every concert and every event and people there are like
3574942 you could always find him there having a drink on his own at the bar his bike locked up outside i think it taught all these other stars how to be that kind of cool and how much people there appreciate it
3574943 she clearly seems to be into that scene right now but we should applaud her
3574944 it speaks well of her that shed rather hang out in lower east side dive bars than lunch at the ivy
3574945 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3574946 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3574947 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go

3574955 the data is likely to show a further rise in unemployment the figures will confirm that we are entering a crucial stage when the decisions taken by the bank of england and the government will have a major impact on how many jobs are lost as the slowdown bites in 2009
3574956 the bank of england needs to address growing expectations of recession across the economy by cutting interest rates to boost business and the government needs to put more money in the pockets of public sector workers to raise flagging consumer confidence
3574957 the labour market data should show a faster pace of rising unemployment
3574958 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3574959 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3574960 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster
3574961 saya mengapresiasi kalau mui mau mengeluarkan fatwa haram merokok yang berdampak terhadap perlindungan anak anak di indonesia karena selama batas makruh berarti jika dikerjakan mendapat cela jika tidak dikerjakan tidak apa apa padahal dari segi kesehatan lebih banyak negatifnya
3574962 walaupun mungkin tidak terlalu signifikan tetapi sebagai isu massal akan menunjukkan kepada masyarakat oo ternyata mui memiliki sudut pandang yang cukup menarik dan bagus apalagi kerangkanya meminimilisir perokok kesannya kan kalau fatwa itu biasanya memberi histeria massal
3574963 tetapi paling tidak ada masukan berupa pandangan ulama bahwa ini sangat membahayakan sedangkan kalau konsekuensi pada undang undang kan akan dilihat dari berbagai sudut pandang nantinya akan berbeda sisi misalnya dari soal produksi tenaga kerja akan ada pro kontra tetapi kali ini kita harus memberi dukungan besar bagi mui
3574964 un pol tico fracasado corrupto que brind el poder a las redes de narcotr fico que se apoderaron de las instituciones mexicanas
3574965 el injerencismo de este personaje que se encuentra en el pa s brindando charlas sobre lo que l cree que es democracia
3574966 en este momento la alcald a de managua es la joya de la corona
3574967 la desesperaci n de la derecha nicarag ense patrocinada por el imperio norteamericano ante el avance de la revoluci n que lidera el frente sandinista de liberaci n nacional
3574968 se mueven dentro de un circuito financiado por el gobierno gringo de eu para diseminar sus pol ticas imperialistas y lo que ellos creen del concepto de democracia
3574969 es un circuito que se monta de acuerdo a los fines objetivos y prop sitos del imperio todos sabemos que nos estamos moviendo en un mundo donde todav a las pol ticas imperiales pretenden destruir los caminos que avanzan precisamente en restituci n de derechos para los pueblos que tienen que ser libres
3574970 la falta de inteligencia del imperio norteamericano en su af n de desvirtuar a los gobiernos revolucionarios tal es el caso de nicaragua
3574971 c mo se les ocurre traer a pol ticos fracasados si tuvieran inteligencia debieron de traer a gente que logr resultados para mejorar la vida de sus pueblos pero pol ticos fracasados que destruyeron inclusive a su pa s eso solamente me puede causar risa
3574972 hay mucho en riesgo en este momento aqu en nicaragua
3574973 signos claros de que el camino que se est siguiendo nada tiene de democr tico ni de proceso de desarrollo sustentable ni de creaci n y fortalecimiento de instituciones
3574974 en esta ocasi n despu s de amplias conversaciones y de la posibilidad de que se dieran todos estos encuentros como resultado de la presi n del gobierno chino ninguno de ellos se pudo formalizar
3574975 el secretario particular del presidente c sar nava as nos lo comunic
3574976 han estado muy activos el embajador chino hablando con empresarios con gente de gobierno con diplom ticos intentando hacer lo mismo
3574977 lo grave de todo esto no es que el presidente no lo reciba sino que lo haga como resultado de la presi n de un gobierno extranjero
3574978 no siento que hay que caminar primero en mi caso antes tendr que consolidarme como estratega y ya posteriormente pensar en otra cosa

3574995 because voice over ip is so easy to learn for people who have backgrounds in networking this is a great way for microsoft small business specialists to bring in a new business
3574996 to sell a phone system is a cool concept for our small business specialist bringing a service into the mix makes it even more enticing we already are getting a lot of interest from our var community but i think this is going to make it even more interesting
3574997 they get better services at a lower cost and small business specialists can start to build an annuity revenue stream that allows them to grow their business year over year without having to expand the business or work harder to do that
3574998 what we found was that a small business with 10 19 employees would save upwards of 8 000 in the first year of deploying a voice over ip service so they are already seeing an roi within the first year
3574999 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3575000 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3575001 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3575002 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3575003 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3575004 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3575005 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3575006 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3575007 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3575008 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3575009 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3575010 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3575011 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3575012 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3575013 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3575014 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3575015 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3575016 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3575017 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3575018 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3575019 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3575020 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3575021 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3575022 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3575023 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3575024 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3575025 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3575026 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3575027 we think that mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the u s they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier staple diet of corn tortillas beans rice fruits and vegetables

3575111 fruit is generally expensive in japan and people often buy grapes peaches and melons as luxury gifts japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high end fruits especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year
3575112 god in the beginning formed matter in solid massy hard impenetrable moveable particles
3575113 i dont think people who refuse to take scientists word on an issue are stupid at all
3575114 are conspiracies against the laity and i do not suggest that the medical conspiracy is either better or worse than the military conspiracy the legal conspiracy the sacerdotal conspiracy the pedagogic conspiracy the royal and aristocratic conspiracy the literary and artistic conspiracy and the innumerable industrial commercial and financial conspiracies from the trade unions to the great exchanges which make up the huge conflict which we call society
3575115 are physicists men of science i presume nobody will question the existence of a widely spread popular delusion that every physicist is a man of science it is escaped only in the very small class which understands by science something more than conjuring with retorts and spirit lamps magnets an microscopes and discovering magical cures for diseases to a sufficiently ignorant man every captain of a trading schooner is a galileo every organ grinder a beethoven every piano tuner a helmholtz every old bailey barrister a solon every seven dials pigeon dealer a darwin every scrivener a shakespeare every locomotive engine a miracle and its driver no less wonderful than george stephenson as a matter of fact the rank and file of physicists are no more scientific than their tailors or if you prefer to put it the reverse way their tailors are no less scientific than they doctoring is an art not a science any layman who is interested in science sufficiently to take in one of the scientific journals and follow the literature of the scientific movement knows more about it than those physicists probably a large majority who are interested in it and practice only to earn their bread
3575116 therefore it is clear that physics is using keplers rule to make computations
3575117 theyre only as daring as their target demographic allows them to be
3575118 its a lot harder to be bold and daring when youre designing something for a more middle class larger group of people i see it all the time at school someone designs something ridiculously expensive and their target market board is filled with shots of young incredibly rich people cut out from magazines

3575134 we have a double whammy today with both heavyweight sectors under pressure
3575135 we had commodity prices down overnight so the resources sector has been hit very hard and the financials are also down
3575136 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3575137 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3575138 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together

3575146 theres still no issue on the wages side so it wont prevent the reserve bank cutting rates
3575147 the wages numbers overall would need to be pushing through to 4 5 per cent annually to be an issue
3575148 jobs growth has come down considerably on a monthly basis
3575149 its not surprising that theres still a little bit of wages pressure there
3575150 one of the last things you would expect to slow
3575151 most people expect employment growth to keep flowing as it has been and for the unemployment rate to rise
3575152 the rba has had inflationary pressures and it has been trying to slow the economy

3575155 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3575156 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3575157 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3575158 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3575159 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3575160 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3575161 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3575162 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3575163 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3575164 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3575165 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3575175 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3575176 save it for 2050 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america american to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today values of fairness compassion responsibility giving back

3575187 the current version of the bill strikes a fair balance between giving city workers a choice on where to live and still protecting city jobs for city residents
3575188 that is the kind of principled answer that i expected from you

3575192 you know i cant be around you 24 7 to watch what you do and frankly id never want to be in that sort of relationship anyway im with you because i believe in you and i hope thats why youre with me im a quality person and i want to be around people that have champagne tastes if you decide you want to go out for beer i cant stop you but instead ill have realized that youre not the person i am looking for and ill go off to find someone else that wants champagne
3575193 if she doesnt want you around maybe she understands that you deserve someone better

3575237 you never want to see a guy be out you want to have him out there playing each and every day and i know madieu wants to be out there because he loves to play football and hes that type of competitor
3575238 but in saying that its the nature of the nfl the nature of playing football guys are going to get hurt
3575239 what did i see in the newspaper four weeks five weeks six weeks we just dont know i dont know im not clairvoyant
3575240 all i have to do is just learn a few things about the free safety and ill jump right in there if they need me to
3575241 its been tough its just a mental strain because there are so many plays and so many gaps youve got to remember on every play
3575242 with what we like to do we have to make sure everyone is in a certain area and you have a certain area you have to cover
3575243 thats probably the main thing being a star player in college a lot of times youre asked to do a lot more things here in the nfl with the defense that we have you just need to do your job and everything will take care of itself
3575244 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3575245 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3575246 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3575247 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3575248 we do believe that broadening our assortment and having iphone in our stores is certainly going to be very important

3575253 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3575254 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3575255 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3575256 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3575257 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3575258 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3575259 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3575260 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3575261 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3575262 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3575263 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3575264 we suffer from hopeless romanticism well be taking donations and hey why dont we set up one of those walks for a cure
3575265 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3575266 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3575267 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3575268 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3575269 and hopefully some of us will hear the at the end of the week
3575270 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3575271 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3575272 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3575273 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3575274 oh we must have gotten the day mixed up im not sure which day it actually is well get back to you on it
3575275 she is a wonderful person that has done so much for golf especially to make it more accessible to juniors she is an amazing woman and i really appreciate you recognizing her and making the community more aware of one of its gems
3575276 that article brought back some fond memories of my younger days when i caddied at the broadmoor between 1946 and 1948 i caddied for judy a few times back then i can still recall carrying a bag for that skinny little girl fond memories
3575277 thank you thank you thank you a thousand times thank you for that wonderful article about judy bell she has touched people who dont even know she exists
3575278 she has been working tirelessly for all kinds of golf especially womens golf for years and years and years
3575279 and her legacy is going to be all the lives she has touched all two million kids some of whom will never even hear her name but whose lives will be better
3575280 were completely indifferent to the one way in which they were not diverse which is to say they all came overwhelmingly from the top 5 to 10 percent of american wealth
3575281 in a moment when actually the greatest problem in american society is not racism and its not sexism the greatest problem in american society is the increasing gap between the rich and the poor
3575282 its obvious that racism and sexism and homophobia are all bad things
3575283 this is a lot of rich people telling themselves that virtue consists of getting rid of their prejudices and not getting rid of their money
3575284 princeton has decided for some reason that 50 100 makes you count as poor
3575285 that money is going to people who are already rich the 97th percentile and its giving them a little more money
3575286 yeah yeah hes really right about diversity but hes a communist
3575287 its not because my position is somewhere in the middle its because its none of the above
3575288 in the us if you look at quintiles of american wealth its obvious right up front african americans in particular are overrepresented at the bottom and theyre underrepresented at the top and why is that we know perfectly well why that is its because of slavery its because of jim crow its because of concurrent racism so youve got the legacy of past racism and youve got the continuation of racism in that sense you want to say yeah being black and being poor are closely related
3575289 but the crucial thing to see is that racism is just a selection mechanism
3575290 its capitalism that produces inequality not racism in a completely non racist society youd still have poor people they just wouldnt be predominantly black
3575291 i argue anti racism and indeed the commitment to diversity are fundamentally conservative positions because what theyre trying to do is take neo liberalism the contemporary form of unrestrained untaxed unhindered capitalism and trying to make it work better
3575292 basically acting like the human resources division of the right
3575293 they are trying to produce exactly the right work force for a neoliberal economy and that doesnt count as a critique of capitalism that counts as a perfection of capitalism
3575294 its not that that means anti racism is wrong it means preaching against racism has about as much progressive political force as preaching against theft theft is also wrong but the world would not be a more equal place with respect to the division of resources if there were no theft racism is wrong but the world would not be a more equal place with respect to division of resources if there were no racism

3575296 then he just stood up on his hind legs and jumped on me
3575297 to see my little brother bleeding was scary i should have seen that big bear coming
3575298 he was mad because he didnt get what he wanted he was going to make his stand
3575299 i dont know if you would call a bear like that a demented bear like some people or a super bear that decides hey i can take a person
3575300 these homes are not fit for anyone to live in
3575301 in the brush in the middle of nowhere on a dead end road
3575302 weve known for a while they were a little strange that they didnt want interference from the outside world but unless were down there on a call its not part of our routine patrol
3575303 jail is inappropriate for these folks but to go untreated is not the answer either
3575304 those people are treated the same way as any citizen involved in an event linked to a criminal investigation we are meeting everyone to establish the facts and the officers will be met in coming days
3575305 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3575306 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3575307 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3575308 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3575309 they screen tons of kids they put them all through some very very good fundamental training and then the cream rises to the top
3575310 like any sport it takes money to create opportunities and more and more countries are streamlining funds to where the medals are i think thats sad
3575311 you still have to work within a budget but theres a been a subtle mind shift in the last two or three years where the athletics leadership says okay what do we need to do rather than what can we afford to do
3575312 the individual cost born by the athlete either has been dramatically diminished or its gone
3575313 its hard doing a full time job and training full time
3575314 in this situation being a student it gave me the flexibility to have time to train
3575315 theyre putting money into these programs at a very late stage
3575316 we for sure though can be looking at pre adolescent training on a much more intense level
3575317 a lot of times in canada you say well they are still young yet they have a long career but you have to instill all the skills all the flexibility all the movement patterns before they get through adolescence the clock is ticking and we have to understand that in canada
3575318 truly id like to thank you who saved my life the gentleman who drove a silver coloured 4x4 i dont know his name but i remember he hit the bear
3575319 without him i wouldnt be here i know i only had a minute left probably less
3575320 hes going to eat me hes not going to go away
3575321 i could not sleep i have very bad dreams i still can see the bear that tried to eat me its fresh i cannot get over it right now
3575322 but its an individual choice im happy i did it i would do it again
3575323 its one chance every four years to get out an image of a healthy athletic woman instead of an underweight underage model athletes bodies are much healthier and theyre functional
3575324 people told me it was something theyd show to their daughters i mean i was obsessed like everyone else with fashion magazines when i was a teenager its natural to look for the body ideal
3575325 here is a woman a great athlete 160 pounds who can bench press her own body weight and squat 180 pounds
3575326 smart women why wouldnt they also want to be seen as sexual
3575327 as humans we like the physically good looking the beautiful
3575328 but how much better if shes also the fastest woman in the world
3575329 gave me the opportunity to go out into the business world and prepared me for life i owe it all to being an athlete and having the opportunity to swim in college
3575330 were very very shy i mean the first time i went to a topless beach in spain i almost dropped dead then i saw a grandma over there and thought yeah i can do this
3575331 i knew i was attractive to the opposite sex but didnt see myself as sexy
3575332 i got a letter from a whole platoon in the u s navy saying how sexy i was i thought you gotta be freaking kidding
3575333 why thats delightful there is a call out for geekery to be submitted to help them dress the set for season three

3575336 we renovated them sometimes we had to take them down to the studs others were in better shape

3575358 it is fair to conclude that the number of detainees is likely to be between the number who were arrested during gop conventions in philadelphia in 2000 and the number who were arrested in new york in 2004
3575359 in philadelphia there were 600 arrested in new york 1 800
3575360 i really dont believe that it is going to reach 1 800 with the information i have now
3575361 the st paul police are telling us they will be doing things more thoughtfully than new york
3575362 they are being trained to avoid some of the arrest situations

3575386 oh dont worry about that she wont be involved with that
3575387 ten years later after giving thousands of pages of interviews talking to the sec talking to the fbi people who wanted garth drabinsky the first time you mention this it is 2005 because you have such a fantastic memory
3575388 anything is possible but i do recall the incident as ive recounted it to you
3575389 when you had this epiphany did you pick up the phone and call a lawyer
3575390 did you call your best friend did you call the police
3575391 i didnt think it was significant enough to call anyone
3575392 if you didnt think it was a big deal why say it
3575393 that portion of my statement concerning shifting numbers was not what i said to mr drabinsky
3575394 im going to suggest to you that it is absolutely utterly impossible for garth drabinsky to have written that on that page because when it left livent it had no writing on it
3575395 if sgt koenig had been here yesterday she would have corrected me
3575396 the instructions came from eckstein you never received those instructions from garth of myron
3575397 you all thought we where going to fail but it was a trap and look weve been ready for months and we love you all
3575398 you are my child i have set you apart for my purposes
3575399 i said before the relay we were going out there to swim a 400 not a 4x100 so we were a team and it had nothing to do with individuals out there and we came through so michael can keep whatever he gets out of everything but the three of us here we cant even express into words how excited we are to be a part of this team

3575404 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane

3575410 there may be an unplanned pregnancy or there is an illness or theyve lost their job and cant get insurance
3575411 im running out of family members to pay for it

3575414 anytime you try to ban something theres a lot of bycatch
3575415 a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
3575416 our policy makers abhor nuance and the subtle but distinct qualities that differentiate fast food from food that can be served fast
3575417 people do not understand what happens in a disenfranchised community
3575418 the fact remains there are not a lot of food choices in south l a
3575419 anybody who believes fast food is the source of all dietary evil is of course being na ve

3575424 hi sir can i ask you a few questions im with the olympic news service im sure ill see you in the mixed zone once competition starts
3575425 is it a concern or is it a worry maybe a concern but i think we can iron it out
3575426 we knew that this tournament was going to be a tough one because of the fact we came away pretty unprepared compared to former teams so it is going to be a challenge
3575427 every time we touched them it was a foul and getting our big girls in foul trouble really hurt us
3575428 but this game showed a few gaps in our offence and things we need to work on with our defence as well but at the same time we had some adversity to deal with in the refereeing now we have to work out what was us and what was them and fix it all
3575429 i think it is probably not a bad thing being at 80 per cent right now because you dont want to peak too early
3575430 i think the other thing is because we are world champions everyone is hungry to beat us and that is something we have to realise
3575431 an unprecedented build up since the crisis erupted over irans nuclear program
3575432 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3575433 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3575434 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3575435 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3575436 the air was cooler than my body temperature it was still a shock though its been months since i went outside first thing and didnt break into a sweat it was also
3575437 the air force granted me leave to play in the cfl and now theyve deemed that my skills and expertise is at a high need
3575438 im a missile combat crew commander so basically i will be controlling the maintenance and security dealing with the nuclear missiles we have at our base
3575439 when he came into camp he showed some great skills and learned how to pass block which i was really excited about
3575440 as old as i am and being from the states weve been through a few wars since i started growing up in the 60s so yeah theres a huge trepidation
3575441 its part of the cost of being able to live here and talk about football and stuff like that all you have to do is watch the olympics to figure out the rest of the world doesnt quite live like we do
3575442 we found out yesterday and to be honest it sucks
3575443 to see this happen to someone who came out here and worked his ass off and wanted it so bad and is a great guy to have this happen to him is unfortunate we loved having him around
3575444 we go out after games together we travel together and have fun together
3575445 whenever you lose somebody like that especially when its out of your control and the person doesnt want to go either it makes it even tougher
3575446 ive got to go back and do my job and im going to try and stay in shape and keep working out while staying in contact with the argonauts and hopefully something can be worked out next year but at this time i have a commitment i have to fulfill and thats what i have to do
3575447 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3575448 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3575449 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3575450 we have a double whammy today with both heavyweight sectors under pressure
3575451 we had commodity prices down overnight so the resources sector has been hit very hard and the financials are also down
3575452 theres still no issue on the wages side so it wont prevent the reserve bank cutting rates
3575453 the wages numbers overall would need to be pushing through to 4 5 per cent annually to be an issue
3575454 jobs growth has come down considerably on a monthly basis
3575455 its not surprising that theres still a little bit of wages pressure there
3575456 one of the last things you would expect to slow
3575457 most people expect employment growth to keep flowing as it has been and for the unemployment rate to rise
3575458 the rba has had inflationary pressures and it has been trying to slow the economy
3575459 theres still a feeling the wages numbers are not sufficient to stop to the reserve bank from easing rates thats why weve seen a new probable low in the australian dollar
3575460 im feeling good feeling fresh so ill definitely put my hand up for selection
3575461 at this point in time id consider myself as playing

3575475 its wonderful the relationship is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot

3575477 as big and strong as he is he should be able to drive the ball better
3575478 i really take pride in having a lot of infield hits because it says that im running with the best of em said burriss who aspires to be like colorado rockies slap and dash artist willy taveras
3575479 a lot of people said i wouldnt be able to make it hitting like that but i feel i can eventually be a taveras caliber player
3575480 hes done better than i thought he would do said lansford stressing that he wants burriss to develop gap power as opposed to hitting the ball out of the park
3575481 hes done a very good job putting the ball in play but he chases too much and there are other things well work
3575482 its something gm brian sabean and i have talked about ill leave it at that bochy said

3575563 fcc commissioner return of fairness doctrine could control web content
3575564 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3575565 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3575566 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3575567 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3575568 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3575569 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate

3575604 jesus christ although matthew 1 21 interprets the name originally joshua that is yahweh is salvation and finds it specially appropriate for jesus of nazareth it was a common one at that time
3575605 his name is jesus the name jesus is the same as saviour it is derived from the verb signifying to save in hebrew it is the same as joshua in two places acts 7 45 and hebrews 4 8 in the new testament it is used where is means joshua the leader of the jews into canaan and in our translation the name joshua should have been retained
3575606 jesus the greek form of a hebrew name which had been borne by two illustrious individuals in former periods of the jewish history joshua the successor of moses and jeshua the high priest who with zerubbabel took so active a part in the re establishment of the civil and religious polity of the jews in their return from babylon its original and full form is jehoshua becoming by contraction joshua or jeshua
3575607 jesus this is the regular greek translation of the hebrew joshua
3575608 jesus christ the name jesus means savior and was a common name derived from the ancient hebrew jehoshua
3575609 jesus the greek form of the name joshua or jeshua jeshua yahweh is salvation or yahweh is opulence
3575610 jesus the same name as joshua the former deliverer of israel
3575611 jesus the name matthews gospel explains it as symbolic of his mission for he will save his people from their sins
3575612 the sacred name the word jesus is the latin form of the greek
3575613 jesus for he shall save the play on words yeshua jesus yoshia shall save is possible in hebrew but not in aramaic
3575614 jesus is the same name with joshua the termination only being changed for the sake of conforming it to the greek

3575620 give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need but if a widow has children or grandchildren these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents for this is pleasing to god
3575621 if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever

3575626 our goal is to make business ownership a real possibility for ambitious young canadians under this program where no previous baking or retail experience is required a young individual could be leasing their own business within a year and potentially move on to become a bakery owner within 1 2 years
3575627 by helping to fund these applicants into their own business the cobs bread manage to own program makes franchising a viable first career option for young canadians
3575628 we have trialled the program and our first candidate kevin ker is set to take ownership after leasing our lakshore location for the past 21 months
3575629 cobs has given me the opportunity to fulfil my dreams of owning and operating my own business through this leasing program they have made it possible for the right people to make their dreams a reality
3575630 theres risk as is with any business venture but the most important thing is that all the tools you need to succeed are available and its up to you whether you make them work for you
3575631 since i began the manage to own program i have learnt everything from baking fresh bread to customer service and of course business management
3575632 cobs has provided me with a career that a little over a year ago seemed unobtainable i am now fully geared to manage my own business and satisfied in the knowledge that i love coming to work each and every day

3575634 arctic deer live on islands in canadas arctic region they search for food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of a year their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which they feed and cold enough at least some of the year for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands allowing the deer to travel over it unfortunately according to reports from local hunters the deer populations are declining since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt we can conclude that the decline in arctic deer populations is the result of deer being unable to follow their age old migration patterns across the frozen sea

3575664 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3575665 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3575666 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3575667 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that

3575707 nothing like being told that iraq is the success story of the middle east
3575708 an international political movement that originally supported the reestablishment of a homeland for the jewish people in palestine and continues primarily as support for the modern state of israel
3575709 many israelis had convinced themselves that there was no such thing as a legitimate palestinian nation with a legitimate national claim to any part of palestine they saw the palestinians instead as part of an undifferentiated arab mass stretching from morocco to iraq with no particular cultural historical or ethnic identity linked to the land of palestine this myth was one of the oldest and most enduring in zionist history in the early twentieth century when the zionist movement was just taking off it may have been a necessary myth to be able to convince jews to pick up and leave their homes in moscow johannesburg new york mexico city london and montreal and come to settle in palestine the zionists had to look through the arabs to some extent if the zionists had come to jews around the world and said look we want you to come to palestine but you had better understand that there is another legitimate nation there the palestinians who claim it as theirs and will fight you to the death many jews might never have come

3575714 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3575715 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3575716 to conclude our remarks about the state of the earth we also congratulate all of you who have been doing the faxing and the emailing and the telephoning you gave the declaration an
3575717 we often talk about the sequential flow of events and lets face it it was pretty easy to connect the revised declaration of independence with that which you call your independence day
3575718 and so it is that we ask that you continue with the declaration
3575719 and just as many times before you have been counted among the peacemakers of the world whether kneeling in prayer in a sacred place whether carrying a torch and joining with your neighbors in a march whether attending a rather famous tea party it makes no difference as to the empowerment that each and every one of these participations gave to this ultimate claiming of freedom and peace for all of planet earth
3575720 there are many who as the planet opens up become more consciously aware of divinity ascension and all these kinds of concepts and realities
3575721 soul mates often have the purpose of being as divisive and warring as possible so as to accomplish the final re uniting in peace and joy and love and bliss
3575722 and besides which this re unification may be occurring where youre in one dimension like 3d and the soul mate is in another
3575723 you may not have contracted to come together to do that because youve got all you can do to be a peacemaker for the whole planet
3575724 so we go where we can literally demonstrate to them
3575725 some of them to be honest are afraid of the 3d humans who are continuing to march to the sea as you know that story as so many lemmings
3575726 you take away anything that even slightly resembles truth in that threat
3575727 which brings up another obvious truth and that is planet earth has accepted the protection of the ashtar command the ascended masters the angelic realms and so on not only the guidance but the protection
3575728 they might have to convert their factories to making something for peace instead of war
3575729 so if we keep sending out the message stop making weapons that we give to them theyre getting some of their weapons turning into harmless metal and other materials and theyre getting the picture
3575730 believe me if the animal and plant and mineral kingdoms could vote well they have voted in their consciousness but if they could vote like humans do there would be nothing but peace upon the planet immediately
3575731 it is your passion whether you know it or not to be here to participate in the ascension process and to be a peacemaker
3575732 and now as i have hinted it is time for you to hear another speaker a delightful surprise you know so i ashtar shall leave the stage until we are in communication of this sort again please remember we are always with you practice your telepathy its a lot of fun and so it is

3575793 item six on the agenda the meaning of life now harry youve had some thoughts on this
3575794 thats right yeah ive had a team working on this over the past few weeks and what weve come up with can be reduced to two fundamental concepts one people are not wearing enough hats two matter is energy in the universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a persons soul however this soul does not exist ab initio it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self observation however this is rarely achieved owing to mans unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia

3575797 ive learned more about ee in that hour and a half than i have in the last month of playing around with my local install
3575798 i think its a step forward that we were able to reach an agreement on fully investigating the issue again
3575799 if the agreement is not acted upon then everything will break down if that happens we will also take necessary measures

3575801 there were multiple complex gunshot wound sic on the left face surrounding the left eye base of nose upper cheek and forehead with laceration and blackening of the skin
3575802 burning and blackening is a feature of very close range shots probably from less than a foot away if you see burning and soot type burning it indicates that the barrel of the gun was very close to the skins surface

3575815 although my cancer treatment the surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy has finished i still need medication
3575816 as a result of my cancer im now on three different drugs they cost me about 44 a month that may not sound much to some but im struggling financially
3575817 im now on statutory sick pay because ive been too unwell to work my income is 360 per month and quite frankly i have barely enough money to live on
3575818 i budget for everything i dont go out because i cant afford to socialise i cant even invite friends over for a meal because i cant afford the food
3575819 i dont eat breakfast or lunch the meals i do buy are ones that are on special offer
3575820 i cant afford fresh fruit or meat i know that isnt healthy but i simply cant afford to buy healthy food
3575821 i have stayed awake at night for hours crying thinking how can i make this work
3575822 fighting cancer is hard enough without the terrible financial worry that comes with it
3575823 i feel penalised because i have a disease that the government doesnt consider should make me exempt from prescription charges
3575824 people must never be forced to choose between food or medication the government must act now

3575829 while this helps us understand the root causes it doesnt change the fundamental problem that we are as a nation less active than we should be
3575830 all children regardless of their natural abilities should be given adequate encouragement and support to be physically active at school and at home

3575832 but if you man him hodge up then you open up buddy franklins end of the ground or you close down luke but you cant have it both ways
3575833 if you want to man up that end hodge then you are making it a one on one scenario for their key forwards franklin and roughead and there are not too many sides that can handle their key forwards on a one on one basis which they have shown all year
3575834 so we will have to make the decision which way we go as the week goes on
3575835 they beat another side brisbane last week who are around the same spot as us on the ladder and also trying to force their way into the eight and they did a fair number on them
3575836 what i see is that china is becoming more like us the west in many ways and were becoming more like china in many ways
3575837 i wouldnt say that we are the same society yet but what we see are these sort of steady trends and a kind of an odd sort of meeting in the middle
3575838 they embrace the side of our society of extreme consumer capitalism and our leaders start to embrace many of their tools of social control indefinite detention loss of civil liberties that their leaders are embracing

3575851 for me the bottom line was finding the right coach for our organization at this time
3575852 it was a rigorous interview process extremely thorough i dont want any perception the other candidates werent qualified or werent good people because they were i just found the candidate thats the right coach for our organization scott gordon really stood out
3575853 i noticed from the first handshake that we were able to communicate whether we were talking about the technical part of the game or about how to build a consistent contending team we had a lot of the same thought processes i think hes going to do an outstanding job with our young players and he will communicate well with veterans too
3575854 system wise hes adamant about playing a tight defensive system hes going to make a difference starting with our defensive zone the neutral zone forecheck will be different too its going to be a great fit for our players
3575855 if these various rhythms be superimposed we find a very interesting series of harmonic intervals developing in time each stage of which is marked by the major conjunction of one or more of planets
3575856 the series 24 27 30 32 36 40 45 48 is familiar to us these figures taken as vibrations represent the relative values of the notes of a major musical scale and we are reminded of old stories that this same musical scale ascribed by legend to the pythagoreans was invented by a special school of astronomers and physicists to echo the music of the spheres it is now clear that this is no legend but actual fact the octave or musical scale is a notation adapted to mans hearing of this harmony of the planetary cycles which in turn is an echo of a great law which controls the development of all processes in the universe
3575857 between human time and solar time lie 36 octaves exactly the same interval separates the vibrations of human music from the vibrations of planetary motions in literal fact the motions of the planets make music for the sun
3575858 the pentagram actually depicts the golden ratio as well as one possible proof of its irrationality applying the euclidean algorithm twice replaces the circumscribed pentagon by the inscribed pentagon proving nontermination of the continued fraction i think that this is better described by the
3575859 the pentad was so revered in early societies that its construction was kept secret the pythagoreans used it as a secret sigh to recognize one another they had studied its principles in geometry and nature and they also knew of its effect on the human psyche they saw in its application a knowledge that could be misused and although it was a teaching tool for a thousand years it was guarded and only taught orally it was not written about by the craft guilds who used its symbolism in the design of the gothic cathedrals and it was not until 1509 when leonardo da vincis teacher luca pacioli published his book divina proportione that the method of its construction and unique geometric properties were publicly revealed to artists and philosophers
3575860 the zodiac of the twelve tonalities is an arrested moment in the endless spiral of sound and the cog that arrests it is the pythagorean comma that much is plain to me what is less so is the development of that makes the diabolus rise out of this system what else can this devil be but the destruction of a rational structure incorporated into that very structure from the beginning so to speak he is the price paid for constraining an everchanging infinite a cyclical infinity that is the very nature of the universe
3575861 what else could this devil be but the destruction of a rational structure incorporated into that very structure from the very beginning
3575862 natural division is always into uneven parts i can already feel the cardinal sin that will call for the devil the product of an even division will never be stable in its duality it makes sense that this interval would tend toward resolution with all its might
3575863 it is the equality of the complementary segments of the octave that makes their terms interchangeable in a flatted fifth each term can belong as third or as seventh to two different tonalities as remote from each other as tonality can be hence two resolutions are possible both occurring with equal ease each as compelling as the other to the ear one single dissonance leads to two different resolutions none favored over the other unless it be further characterized by context but these tonalities are not merely different they stand at opposite poles namely the two poles of the flatted fifth interval a dissonance which finds with equal ease resolution in two extremes the ambiguity this fact introduces into the relationships of the twelve tonalities such is the seed of destruction bound to bring down the entire system of tonality

3575869 if youre making sacrifices unless youre automatically following some rule it stands to reason that youre trying to lessen some psychic discomfort so for example if i took steps to be a doctor for those who dont have medical care it could be regarded as a sacrifice but it could also be regarded as a way to deal with ambivalence

3575879 a special meeting about dallas county traffic tickets turned tense and bizarre this afternoon
3575880 county commissioners were discussing problems with the central collections office that is used to process traffic ticket payments and handle other paperwork normally done by the jp courts
3575881 commissioner kenneth mayfield who is white said it seemed that central collections has become a black hole because paperwork reportedly has become lost in the office
3575882 commissioner john wiley price who is black interrupted him with a loud excuse me he then corrected his colleague saying the office has become a white hole
3575883 that prompted judge thomas jones who is black to demand an apology from mayfield for his racially insensitive analogy
3575884 mayfield shot back that it was a figure of speech and a science term a black hole according to websters is perhaps the invisible remains of a collapsed star with an intense gravitational field from which neither light nor matter can escape

3575917 fuel costs are draining profits from companies which are averaging nearly 4 00 gallon we want to provide information such as properly testing compression on a commercial lawnmower engine detecting a low compression situation and then repairing it this can decrease fuel consumption by up to 20 so in a typical 40 hour work week by not addressing the problem this can add over 40 00 mower week to their fuel expenditures also by implementing the attn preventative maintenance program alone this will help reduce downtime and increase productivity here is an example if a mower belt breaks something that could have been prevented with routine inspection the crew member has to stop working this costs the owner the price of the belt and over 100 00 hr in lost revenues and downtime companies often overlook these happenings until profitability drops dramatically especially for those who operate multiple crews our goal is to partner with our members to minimize or eliminate these occurrences

3575952 when these things happen its like a military intervention if they need to fly someone from houston on a private jet theyll do it theres almost no cost that will be too great to get this refinery operating again
3575953 there are lots of incentives for the operators of the refinery to get it going and up to snuff and producing again because the lost sales dont get recovered
3575954 youd think that all else being equal less supply into the market would result in a little bit of an increase in price because there might be just a little bit more demand compared to supply
3575955 but even having said that we have price wars and prices go up and down for various reasons and something going to counter that increasing price is that in the last couple of months canadians have been driving less than last year because of other increases
3575956 finishes off the gasoline before it gets out to market
3575957 without the cat cracker its like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer you just cant produce the finished product and get it out there
3575958 when you look at the size of the area that prices are based on its a huge area and most of it is driven by what happens in the united states
3575959 when you look at the types of volumes youre dealing with its massive so something like this would be a minor flip
3575960 we really wanted this functionality for yahoo services but we thought that if we just do it ourselves it is much less likely to get wide adoption
3575961 were still pretty early stages in this location stuff but if we can get wide adoption of fire eagle across the web we can become a leader
3575962 we think its a good idea that users can lie about where they are
3575963 like i dont always tell my mother where i am
3575964 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3575965 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3575966 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3575967 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3575968 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3575969 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3575970 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3575971 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3575972 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3575973 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3575974 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3575975 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3575976 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3575977 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3575978 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3575979 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3575980 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3575981 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3575982 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3575983 who are open to doing something on the production side
3575984 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3575985 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3575986 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3575987 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3575988 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3575989 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3575990 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3575991 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3575992 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3575993 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3575994 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3575995 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3575996 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3575997 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3575998 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3575999 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3576000 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3576001 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3576002 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3576003 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3576004 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3576005 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3576006 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3576007 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3576008 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3576009 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3576010 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3576011 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3576012 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3576013 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3576014 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3576015 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3576016 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3576017 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3576018 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3576019 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3576020 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3576021 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3576022 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3576023 in the early days of my second life i noticed how the shadow of a telegraph pole would inch between the gardens of two houses across the street from 152 to the garden of 150 over the course of several hours from lunchtime into evening
3576024 when you leave the house in the morning to start your day what are the two things you always make sure you have for most people the answer is keys and cell phone if you want to reach people then texting them on their cell phone is the fastest surest way to do it
3576025 98 of all text messages are viewed and 90 are read within the first two hours this fact correlates into faster and higher results for marketing campaigns than you can get from any other channel
3576026 corfun has been a leader in enewsletter and opt in mailing strategies for years opt in means the customer signed up to receive the emails from the company we have worked extensively mapping out solutions to get customer newsletters delivered to the people who want them
3576027 but despite our best efforts there is never a 100 guarantee that people who subscribe opt in to a newsletter weve designed will ever receive it spam filters and other impediments to delivery block an amazingly high percentage of marketing emails just getting information into a customers in box is a daunting challenge
3576028 over 1 billion text messages a day are sent in the us alone which means that nine times more text messages are being sent out than emails each day and almost every one of them is reaching its intended audience in 2008 businesses lost an estimated 500 million dollars in earnings because of lost opt in emails these are messages that customers wanted asked for and never received mobile text marketing promises to change all that
3576029 customer satisfaction is our primary aim therefore we always strive to make things as easy and convenient as possible for you the free shipping offer is a step towards the same
3576030 our aim is to make lifelong customers not one time sales and if customers find our services up to the mark they are bound to return
3576031 offers like free shipping and 100 customer satisfaction might seem like small things but they are big when it comes to pleasing the customer we realize that and strive at making vapornation as customer friendly as possible
3576032 with the free shipping offer vapornation has made things for regular vaporizer buyers like me very cost effective now i dont have to spend as much on shipping as the product itself
3576033 low prices quality products and prompt service there is nothing else a customer wants
3576034 to launch a successful email marketing campaign you should have a strong opt in email list sixchannels helps you to zero in on the right opt in list for your specific industry needs and criteria so you can effectively reach your target audience
3576035 manufacturers and sourcing professionals in need of custom manufactured parts components equipment and other products are able to post an open rfq on the site to allow suppliers of such products and services to respond with a proposal
3576036 the idea is to help connect qualified industrial mro distributors and custom manufacturers with production managers facility engineers plant maintenance professionals and others sourcing for such products and services
3576037 the launch of the industrial mro marketplace enables us to provide an additional platform for us based manufacturers and distributors seeking to effectively promote their goods in local national and overseas markets which has always been our primary purpose
3576038 discover the real malaysian secrets of how i consistently rake up to rm38 000 per month into my maybank account working less than 2 hours a week doing almost nothing
3576039 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3576040 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3576041 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3576042 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3576043 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3576044 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3576045 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3576046 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3576047 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3576048 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3576049 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3576050 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3576051 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3576052 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3576053 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3576054 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3576055 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3576056 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3576057 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3576058 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3576059 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3576060 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3576061 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3576062 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3576072 this feature has already been put into use by one of our industrial machinery suppliers when moving to digital information distribution
3576073 they needed to be able to set up multiple licenses for over 1 200 dealers and distributors for a new launch however they wanted to integrate issuing licenses with their existing web interface so that their dealers had a single common interface with them and not confuse them with multiple points of contact since the license files now show the dealers names they were easily generated and collected and organized internally by the manufacturer that meant that as the manufacturers new electronic service went live dealers received the announcement over their existing web portal dealers could pick up their license details directly from the web site using their existing interface for communications so its a win win for everyone the manufacturer knows who the license is for and can make sure it is in the right place to be collected the dealers retain a single point of contact and information and dont need to change the business processes they already have established and the manufacturer has cut out printing costs distribution costs can deliver rapidly and can issue new information immediately big cost savings

3576088 theres been an overwhelming increase in japanese females in their 20s and 30s marrying european and american males this has increased by more than tenfold over the previous five years
3576089 there is data to the effect that about 90 percent of females who major in the humanities at university have experience studying abroad and they have an extremely low threshold toward foreigners also there is information that the women are attracted to elite staff employed by major insurance firms
3576090 that may be the case now but after a few more years i suppose the ratio of caucasians will increase
3576091 i heard from nozze and zwei matchmaking services that many japanese women are asking dont you have any foreigners i suppose from now caucasian males will keep on rising in the rankings
3576092 just as before theres no change in the 40 to 60 age bracket they dont get along well with japanese females which has resulted in their turning towards foreign women this began increasing from more than 10 years ago and there are said to be between 2 000 to 3 000 marriage brokers in japan

3576133 a lot of hot air stitched together by a fair amount of blatant demagoguery
3576134 i just think its a tragedy for this region its a tragedy for young players and for all the aspiration thats out there
3576135 if any of these guys have an aspiration to play at a higher level than heartland rugby then theyre going to have to move away arent they we could be talking about 20 to 30 players and that to me is the sad part of it all
3576136 were getting told the third week into this competition that were not going to be there next season that alone is a distraction the players will have a lot on their minds where is their future where is their career going to be
3576137 i dont think a lot of good comes out of negative motivation and weve got a really good team here weve got really good people here and we just need to keep our pride and our dignity thats something theyll never be able to take away from us
3576138 thats the only option for me i guess he said
3576139 id like to stay in the crusaders environment so canterbury is probably the only place to go
3576140 things were just starting to roll along quite well now and now its been taken away from all the players and the younger guys who are coming up weve got a few new guys in the team this year and theres a lot of good talent around the tasman region
3576141 everyones pretty gutted and pissed off about it he said
3576142 im not too sure what im going to be doing next season because i head over to the uk after the air new zealand cup so i wont be making any decisions until january or february
3576143 it doesnt really give the kids in this region and upcoming talent anything to aspire to its a shame really but we cant do a hell of a lot about it weve just got to keep playing
3576144 ive just got to keep playing and hopefully get an opportunity somewhere else he said but im pretty gutted to be honest im really enjoying this place

3576188 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3576189 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3576190 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3576191 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3576192 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3576193 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3576194 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3576195 no account was taken of the fact that he was facing serious health problems which impacted on both his emotional and physical fitness to address the respondents performance concerns
3576196 iran is the trouble maker trying to tip over apple carts all over baghdad right now because they want america to pull out and do you know why its because theyve already decided that theyre going to partition iraq and half of iraq the western northern portion of iraq is going to be called the iraq state of islam something like that and im sorry i dont have the official name but its meant to be the training ground for the terrorists theres already an agreement made they are going to get half of iraq and that is going to be a terrorist safe haven zone where they can go ahead and bring about more terrorist attacks in the middle east region and then to come against the united states because we are their avowed enemy
3576197 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3576198 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3576199 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3576200 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3576201 less like an outlaw than a slightly slow student who doesnt understand the words he is reading
3576202 put it this way before the all star game it was feeling a little maybe like i had a tiny bit of tendinitis in there not bad
3576203 if i would have just thrown regular at the all star game it probably would have gone away because i had the other 3 days off over the break but that didnt allow it to recover it didnt help it at all i dont want to say the all star game caused it to be bad but obviously it didnt help it
3576204 you know shes just getting you ready for when the baby gets here
3576205 i think we got what we wanted out of this scrimmage
3576206 tony jackson hadn t had a lot of practice at running back because i moved him in spring practice from defense jay hollingsworth patirck kurunwune and cameron jones are behind that but nobody at this point has asserted itself so i am kind of scouring the team looking at every situation to try to find help in that position
3576207 i just dont dwell on injuries in football its an unhealthy thing to do and i learned that early in my career we wont ever do that as a team
3576208 vince is a very talented player that was injured after he came when we cam to be quite honest with you he wasnt in good enough shape to play like i think the guy can play hes now coming around conditioning is a little challenging for him with his health status bet hes coming around to becoming a pretty disruptive football player im real anxious to see what kind of year he has
3576209 thad has his best day today hes really done a good job getting a grasp of the offense his conditioning level is way beyond what it was zack has shown he can make big plays what zack has to do is show me more consistency in managing the offense and putting guys in the right place and more consistent running the football hes very capable of doing that
3576210 oh good i want to talk to you this boy here hes mine he needs all the help you can give him grammar reading everything his fluency what do you call it well his fluency needs to be strengthened
3576211 well this is the sixth grade hallway seventh grade is upstairs
3576212 uh i think theyre upstairs too this is my first year teaching here
3576213 thats great ill see you on the first day of school
3576214 i just met a child and they asked me where eighth grade was is that upstairs
3576215 mccain wouldnt have been our person but we definitely feel like it would be a huge help to john mccain to pick someone we can be confident will represent the value voter position i dont think it helps him mccain at all in ohio if he picks romney
3576216 no but i did stay at a holiday inn express last night
3576217 if theres one public official who has consistently put his country ahead of his party working across party lines to get things done in washington it is john mccain
3576218 sen obama has no record that i can see of taking on positions that are held by a lot of people within his own party
3576219 john mccain does that all the time its part of the reason it took some while for a lot of republicans to come to his side sen mccain has worked across party lines on the big issues of our time because he knows he has no patience for partisan politics and all those games
3576220 lou was really looking forward to his starring role in our production and hopes to return to fort worth again soon
3576221 richard brings a sense of gleeful silliness to the role of the devil we are looking forward to his performance
3576222 each production that we have brought to the nsmt mainstage this season has been unique and spelling bee is no exception
3576223 set in a school gymnasium spelling bee takes a hilarious and heartwarming look at the pressures of growing up through the eyes of quirky yet lovable characters competing for the title of spelling bee champ were pleased to present this production whose witty and endearing music and lyrics are created by massachusetts own
3576224 sensual beauty its mysticism is conveyed in oceanic washes of orchestral sound dripping with tuned percussions and melismatic woodwind solos
3576225 the combination of weils severe asceticism and her passionate quest for truth has appealed to me ever since i first read her thoughts together we the three collaborators chose different parts of weils work and life for the libretto before i began composing whereas i have always been fascinated by simones striving for abstract mathematical and spiritual intellectual goals peter is interested in her social awareness and political activities amin brought out the gaping discrepancy between her philosophy and her life showing the fate of the frail human being amongst great ideas
3576226 stretching the boundaries of operatic and concert singing and enriching the landscape of contemporary music
3576227 if orphan annie is the one recollection you have of andrea then you are in for a glorious surprise although embedded forever in our hearts as the red headed orphan in the red dress with the big belt voice andrea has continued her extraordinary career on and off the broadway stages with a unique talent perspective and energy in her show she revisits some of her favorite broadway musical memories from the many shows shes starred in and she takes us on a great journey with her very entertaining and surprising backstage stories she also reveals her natural musical instincts in contemporary pop and jazz and even teases us with hints of broadway roles yet to come
3576228 reaffirmed new yorks proud heritage of welcoming the worlds boldest most powerful works of art
3576229 ayckbourn has created in very human terms a description of how capricious fate is
3576230 its a dazzling tour de force for great comedic actors and a hilarious description of our chaotic universe it is one of ayckbourns greatest plays and speaks to us vividly about a lack of emotional and spiritual compass that most of us experience today
3576231 the female character makes a decision in the first few lines of the play and from that two quite different scenes develop the play is about those tiny decisions we all make in our lives that lead to bigger consequences its a huge concept and is very difficult as there are just two actors playing a total of ten roles all the characters are very different and it is a feat of memory for the actors to learn about 16 to 17 hours worth of dialogue after a production like this you dont have a nerve in your body because it cant get any worse
3576232 its a great challenge for the director and actors because it needs to move speedily and with nuance
3576233 education is learning what you didnt even know you didnt know
3576234 theres so many sluts in las vegas you wont know where to begin
3576235 after you do quite a few sheep it gets old
3576236 shes small but i think shes going to do good
3576237 i placed last before but i think shes going to get me higher than that
3576238 i grew up on a farm but my husband and his whole family grew up in the city
3576239 doing this teaches respect and gives them confidence and it keeps them moving and keeps them outside
3576240 its all about stuff thats been forgotten in the big scheme of things

3576260 apa cu cat e mai saraca cu atat e mai limpede
3576261 i always thought it was a bitter angry department now its confirmed
3576262 i so want to do this its not even funny
3576263 sometimes i think historians are a little like saut chefs they cook everything up and soften the edges
3576264 the satisfaction is winding up with something a little messier and less pat than what you thought
3576265 well this is how you can know what god wants
3576266 youre free to do whatever you want so long as its exactly what i want too
3576267 what the hell have you done and why the hell do these people in your country want to secede
3576268 our first impetus was we want to see a program that works
3576269 at least theyre aware that weve entered the early innings of what could easily become a very disruptive period of our history
3576270 most of them are responding constructively rather than just defensively theyre much more interested in gardening and animal husbandry than firearms
3576271 the gun nuts have been on the scene longer than the peak oil argument has been in play
3576272 they were initially preoccupied with big government and its accompanying narrative fantasy of fascist oppression which is why they adopted a fascist tone themselves but peak oil survivalists are different from the ruby ridge generation they dont think that a bolt hole in the woods is a very promising strategy we have no idea at this point what the level of social cohesion or disorder may be but if the rural areas especially the agricultural centers become too lawless for farming then well be in pretty severe trouble because there will be nothing for us to eat
3576273 there is greater interest in preparedness these days because the fragility of our economy lengthening chains of supply and the complexity of the technological infrastructure have become apparent to a broader cross section of the populace
3576274 all parties concerned may not realize it but the left of center greens calling for local economies and encouraging farmers markets have a tremendous amount in common with john birchers decrying globalist bankers and gun owners complaining about their constitutional rights
3576275 id say that survivalism is indeed a celebration of community
3576276 it is the embodiment of americas traditional can do spirit of self reliance that settled the frontier
3576277 it seems a natural human impulse that we are hard wired to follow as circumstances require
3576278 although it is constrained by social and cultural conditioning to some degree in our consumer culture survivalism is related to the gear fetishism you see in popular magazines that purport to be about sporting adventures but are really about acquiring snazzy equipment america in 2008 has become a cartoon culture of hollywood violence that promotes grandiose power fantasies of hyper individualism and vigilante justice add guns and economic hardship and spice it up with ethnic grievances and the recipe is not very appetizing
3576279 if anything life in the 22nd century will more closely resemble the 19th century than the 20th century sadly the 21st century will probably be remembered as the time of the great die off
3576280 its a very big change but people are resilient and resourceful
3576281 we will witness the formation of some remarkable intentional communities that will feature some unlikely bedfellows anarchists and ayn rand readers mennonites and gun enthusiasts luddites and techno geeks fundamentalist christians and gaia worshippers tree huggers and horse wranglers
3576282 i was panic stricken the 50 year old recalled her voice shaking
3576283 theres going to be things that happen when people cant get things that they need for themselves and their families said lynn marie who believes cities could see a rise in violence as early as 2012
3576284 peak oil the idea that world oil production is set to hit a high point and then decline scientists who support idea say the amount of oil produced in the world each year has already or will soon begin a downward slide even amid increased demand
3576285 i decided there was nothing like getting the training myself to deal with insurrections if thats a possibility said the former executive recruiter
3576286 i remember the oil crisis in 73 i remember waiting in line for gas laskowski said
3576287 if there is a disruption in the oil supply it will be very quickly elevated into a disaster
3576288 theres going to be things that happen when people cant get things that they need for themselves and their families
3576289 i decided there was nothing like getting the training myself to deal with insurrections if thats a possibility
3576290 i remember the oil crisis in 73 i remember waiting in line for gas
3576291 if there is a disruption in the oil supply it will be very quickly elevated into a disaster
3576292 assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilised infrastructure
3576293 the four horsemen of the apocalypse ride out every two generations and they come in different disguises
3576294 we are due to see the horsemen again some time in the next 10 to 20 years and the prudent person with wealth should take out an insurance policy against them
3576295 imagine if the next outage lasted for four or five days there would be a mass exodus from cities

3576299 look at this picture of me holding beer and making a retarded face because it perfectly exemplifies my charm
3576300 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3576301 i was moved every time we did a rehearsal on this from the bottom of my heart
3576302 please save the last bit of trueness in our children
3576303 they think yang peiyis smile is not cute enough what we need is truth not some fake loveliness i hope the kids will not be hurt this is not their fault
3576304 after the recording we thought that lin miaokes voice was not very suitable
3576305 finally we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis
3576306 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially during the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3576307 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3576308 my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough
3576309 the music director announced just now that it was not your voice when you were singing at the opening ceremony the song was actually performed by you two girls
3576310 doesnt care who sang the song as long as she performed
3576311 yes i have gained weight and thank you for noticing i have been working very hard on gaining some weight for health purposes
3576312 why cant i just get an effing migraine like everybody else
3576313 none of the above none of the above its not what you think
3576314 i could not finish this script and i am not certain why i can tell that if this script were to be made into a movie it would be visually and intellectually stimulating however i think it is the writing style that i am not used to sometimes when dealing with alternate futuristic or parallel worlds that are similar to our own it helps if there is a prologue of some sort to orient the audience star wars the golden compass and aeon flux are movies that do that to sort of prepare the audience for what is about to come i think that may help pique my interest a little more
3576315 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3576316 i hope everything is ok with you let me know if i can help
3576317 you shouldnt leave your car sitting somewhere with the back windshield out
3576318 we know that if other peoples freedom is threatened then its not long before our freedom is threatened
3576319 we are here to say that we are not afraid
3576320 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3576321 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very considerable losses
3576322 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3576323 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3576324 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3576325 its like the old soviet days they were making an example of us for ukraine and others to see
3576326 what we need is to get out of a crisis i just want to push people to dialogue
3576327 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
3576328 schools hospital houses all infrastructure is ruined theres no water no electricity we will rebuild it
3576329 in the event such a decision were made made by the un or another international organisation estonia could be ready to offer our input
3576330 estonia has said many times that the principles of the peacekeeping operation in south ossetia and abkhazia should be changed given that russia has became one of sides in the conflict we can no longer talk of peacekeeping by russian forces in ordinary terms
3576331 one solution could be to form peacekeeping forces in those georgia n regions where they are needed from states that have not been involved in the conflict

3576335 she is a very dangerous person no doubt about it
3576336 to find someone who has such rich information computer hard drives e mails that is really a major capture
3576337 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3576338 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody
3576339 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3576340 were proud of our role as americas first line of defense against foreign animal diseases
3576341 were equally proud of our safety record not once in our nearly 50 years of operation has an animal pathogen escaped from the island
3576342 russia didnt beat the georgian army it defeated the us army
3576343 these allegations of election fraud are paranoid fantasies the republicans and their friends in the voting machine industry wouldnt dare fix a national election such a conspiracy would be too massive to keep secret and once it came to light it would destroy the gop
3576344 if the border patrol doesnt get you the chicken and burgers will go vegan
3576345 we think that mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the u s they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier staple diet of corn tortillas beans rice fruits and vegetables

3576354 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
3576355 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores

3576372 how are you handling the two big deadlines from tea
3576373 and the 8th grade tech literacy one due in november
3576374 i dont know about the online testing but i called tea on the 8th grade asessment
3576375 who did you talk to and what did they say
3576376 since technology apps is integrated to all content areas told me that you could just average students grades in all the content areas and report that as their technology literacy
3576377 in whose world would that ever be a valid measure of technology literacy
3576378 yeah well theres a september 1 deadline for submitting the online testing survey had you heard of it
3576379 no i hadnt but if it hasnt come up its probably not a big deal

3576396 the japanese economy is certainly not falling into a hole
3576397 given that japan hasnt had excess capacity excess debt and excess employment this cyclical slowdown is not going to slip into a full blown structural adjustment like we saw with the recessions in the 1990s
3576398 its probably a line ball call whether japan meets the technical definition of a recession which is two quarters of negative growth
3576399 slowing domestic economy and volatile capital markets were likely to continue to impact performance
3576400 the south east cannot take any more people and people in the north west did not want to go
3576401 people are more than happy with the regeneration work that is happening
3576402 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3576403 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3576404 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3576405 we should consider expanding both dramatically just as liverpool and manchester expanded in the 19th century dynamic economies require dynamic economic geography
3576406 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3576407 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes
3576408 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3576409 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3576410 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together
3576411 i wouldnt know about it we are facilitating discussions among three parties
3576412 no deal has been signed by anyone dialogue is still continuing
3576413 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race

3576422 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3576423 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3576424 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3576425 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3576426 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3576427 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3576428 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3576429 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3576430 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3576431 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3576432 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3576433 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3576434 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3576435 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3576436 i feel like i should go back in there but ive got to wait and see i guess
3576437 im still out here trying to work and get better and put my best product on the field and let the coaches worry about who is playing when and where and all that stuff im trying to focus on being the best keary colbert i can be
3576438 but i see what theyre trying to get done the important thing is the big picture its no big thing anything to help the team
3576439 he wouldnt be working with the starting unit unless he has proven to us that he is very consistent and deserves that chance to start especially with jackson who has been doing very good colbert and some guys who have played in the league
3576440 unless we stop russia unless the whole world stops it russian tanks will go to any european capital tomorrow
3576441 the u s economy caught up with the coated paper market during the second quarter and we saw a dramatic slowdown in demand for coated papers and rapid increases in input costs
3576442 we took immediate actions and curtailed production to limit inventory growth raised prices in april and again in july and initiated additional productivity programs to offset the rising costs in addition to accelerating the permanent shutdowns we previously announced as part of the integration of stora enso north america we also announced the closure of our mill in kimberly wisconsin to align capacity with market demand
3576443 from an operations perspective we were challenged during the quarter to manage the decrease in demand for our coated products along with increased inflation for energy raw materials and transportation
3576444 despite the difficult actions weve had to initiate we are still able meet the needs of our customers the rapid integration of our production capability allows us to produce most products on multiple paper machines at the mills with the lowest costs we are moving ahead on all of our key initiatives such as the business systems integration lean six sigma activities capital investments to drive cost productivity and accelerating improvements across the company these actions will enable newpage to remain financially strong and maintain its position as the clear industry leader
3576445 we expect crude oil and energy costs to remain high throughout the year
3576446 as a result of these continued inflationary pressures we raised sales prices and will continue to closely monitor input costs
3576447 our integration activities continued throughout the quarter and we remain on track to meet our previously announced long term target of 265 million in annual synergies from the sena acquisition
3576448 this will change the large format market in a significant way and has the ability to take away share from other printing applications the speed is a significant improvement and there is great market potential with the diverse range of materials it can print on
3576449 the biggest thing we have noticed is the increase in productivity with the inca onset we get to print even faster with more predictable and consistent output as an example we recently conducted a rerun of an exact job we printed last year it was completed in 5 hours versus 20 hours last year representing 4x efficiency and a saving of 15 hours
3576450 the quality of the output is another step forward customers are commenting that the full color digital printing is striking and are particularly impressed with the quality of the gloss settings now we deliver a gloss finish without the need to put a clear coat using another process also with a 5 foot 1 5m printhead posters with large blocks of solid colors are exceptional without the banding typically found on many inkjet printers
3576451 perhaps the most significant indicator of the impact of the inca onset is that before 25 of our work was digital now it is already 70 we believe that inca onset is one of those remarkable products that truly provides a significant leap in the way printers can conduct business
3576452 we are sincerely honored that the pia gatf judges have deemed the inca onset a 2008 intertech technology award recipient when we introduced the onset a year ago i commented that we believed the onset represents the second major advance in inkjet print production since the first initial introduction of the flatbed press in 2000 and has been engineered from the ground up to achieve new levels of performance its design drew on our vast experience of jetting inks and includes some of the core technologies we have developed to produce other inca presses that already lead the wide format display market in speed and output reports from installations throughout the world support our optimism
3576453 we have always reinvested in leading edge print technology that enables us to deliver high quality work punctually our clients appreciate the initiative we take to exceed their expectations
3576454 it became apparent that a new press was required to fulfil our clients ambitions for more specialized work
3576455 when it came time to upgrade everyone at nathen had a say in what press and configuration was needed not just any press configuration would do
3576456 we wanted to have production capability that no else could offer in western canada yet have enough mainstream flexibility where many print buyers would gravitate to it
3576457 one of the fringe benefits you get in buying from manroland
3576458 the prindor in line foiler offers a unique capability to a print buyer it provides the ability to create a finish unlike any other metallic product on the market in print form
3576459 we now have the capability to lay down foil in line during the print run
3576460 not only will it accent aspects of the image in silver or gold but it can additionally print cmyk over the foil to create an entirely new image impression or printed piece with the addition of the uv we can print 4 over 4 with in line dry trap varnish another capability that gives us an edge in this market
3576461 we are excited to add someone of brians caliber to the mimeo com team

3576523 di dunia ini tak ada negeri yang tak memiliki raja bagaimana kerajaan burung bisa tak memiliki raja seorang pun sampai sekarang keadaan ini tak bisa kita biarkan berlangsung terus kita harus bersama sama berusaha dan pergi mencari seorang raja buat kita karena tak adalah negeri yang pemerintahannya baik dan teratur rapi tanpa seorang raja
3576524 aku adalah salah seorang di antara mereka yang telah mengecap rahmat tuhan aku adalah utusan dari alam gaib aku memiliki pengetahuan ketuhanan dan rahasia makhluk makhluk nya bila ada burung seperti aku dengan paruh bertanda nama tuhan bismillah pantaslah burung seperti itu kalian ikuti karena orang harus mempunyai pengetahuan yang luas mengenai rahasia rahasia yang gaib namun hari hari bersliweran tak putus putusnya dan aku tak punya sangkut paut lagi dengan apa dan siapa pun seluruh diriku telah diliputi oleh cinta kepada baginda raja aku bisa mendapatkan air dengan naluriku dan begitu banyak rahasia kehidupan lain telah kuketahui aku telah bercakap cakap dengan nabi sulaiman beserta pengikut pengikutnya yang utama yang mengherankan ialah biasanya dia tak pernah bertanya dan tak pernah ingat lagi kepada siapa saja yang pernah mengunjungi istananya namun kepadaku sehari saja aku jauh dari sisinya dikirimnya utusan ke mana mana untuk mencariku sehingga kemuliaanku tak pernah berkurang karenanya akulah yang mengirimkan surat suratnya dan aku pulalah sahabatnya yang paling setia burung yang telah dimuliakan oleh sang nabi memperoleh anugerah mahkota di atas kepalanya dapatkah burung yang bisa bercakap cakap seperti itu rontok bulu bulunya dalam debu bertahun tahun lamanya sudah aku menjelajahi lautan dan daratan mengarungi puncak puncak gunung dan dasar lembah aku sanggup menerobos ruang yang sesak dilanda banjir dahsyat aku senantiasa mengiringi nabi sulaiman setiap kali bepergian dan aku telah mengenal batas batas dunia
3576525 aku kenal raja itu dengan baik tapi aku tak bisa terbang sendiri menemuinya bebaslah dirimu dari rasa malu sombong dan ingkar dia pasti bisa melimpahkan cahaya bagi mereka yang sanggup melepaskan belenggu diri sendiri mereka yang demikian itu akan bebas dari baik dan buruk karena berada di jalan kekasihnya bermurah hatilah sepanjang hidupmu sekarang angkatlah kakimu dari bumi dan terbanglah dengan gembira menuju istana sang raja namanya simurgh dia adalah raja diraja sekalian burung dia dekat kepada kita namun kita jauh darinya tempat semayamnya sukar sekali dicapai dan tak ada lidah yang sanggup menyebut namanya di hadapan baginda bergantungan ratusan ribu benang sinar terang dan gelap dan di dalam dunia yang fana maupun baka tak seorang pun yang dapat menaklukkan kerajaannya dialah raja yang berdaulat dan mandi kesempurnaan dia tak pernah memperlihatkan seluruh dirinya juga di tempatnya bersemayam karena itu tak adalah pengetahuan atau kepandaian yang bisa mengetahuinya jalan itu tiada dikenal dan tak seorang pun memiliki kesabaran yang cukup buat menjumpainya walaupun begitu ribuan makhluk senantias merindukannya selama mereka hidup pun jiwa yang paling murni tak dapat menguraikannya pikiran pun tak dapat menggambarkan dua alat penglihatan manusia ini buta di hadapannya kearifan tak dapat mencapai kesempurnaannya dan manusia yang paham pun tak mampu melihat keindahannya seluruh makhluk ingin mencapai kesempurnaan dan keindahan ini melalui khayalannya tapi bagaimanakah kau bisa menjejakkan kaki di jalan itu dengan pikiran bagaimana kau bisa mengukur bulan dengan ikan demikianlah telah ribuan kepala bolak balik pergi ke sana seperti bola yang berputar putar di lapangan dan hanya ratap tangis rindu mereka yang terdengar beribu daratan dan lautan terbentang sepanjang perjalanan menuju tempatnya jangan bayangkan perjalanan ini singkat orang harus memiliki hati singa untuk dapat menempuh jalan yang luar biasa ini karena begitu panjangnya dan lautnya rancam serta dalam pula kau harus berusaha sekuat tenaga disertai senyum dan sesekali menangislah tersedu sedu seperti halnya aku menemukan jejaknya saja sudah merasa bahagia jejaknya sangat berarti dan hidup tanpa dia akan menyebabkan kita diliputi penyesalan seseorang tak boleh menyembunyikan jiwanya dari kekasihnya dia harus menjaga dirinya baik baik agar jiwanya dapat dibawa menuju istana sang raja bersihkan tanganmu dari kotoran hidup ini bila kau ingin disebut orang yang beramal panggillah kekasihmu sebagai orang yang mulia bila kau patuh dan tunduk kepadanya dia akan memberikan seluruh hidupnya kepadamu
3576526 namun demikian pemunculan simurgh yang pertama kali itu tidaklah begitu membingungkan dibanding wujudnya yang rahasia tanda perwujudannya ini merupakan lambang kebesarannya seluruh makhluk yang bernyawa di dunia ini pasti memancarkan bayang bayangnya oleh sebab dalam pemunculannya yang pertama kali tanpa ekor maupun kepala tanpa ujung dan pangkal maka tak perlulah kiranya kuceritakan lebih banyak mengenai dia sekarang bersiap siaplah kalian untuk mengarungi jalan menuju istananya
3576527 ambillah pelajaran dari nasibku seluruh umat manusia terpesona oleh warna bulu simurgh lalu badanku ini yang mereka kurung maka penuhlah hidupku diliputi sedih dan rindu padahal buat terbang di bawah kepak sayap sang simurgh saja aku pun tak sanggup
3576528 dulu aku hidup bersama adam dan hawa di sorga namun akhirnya aku terusir bersama mereka keinginanku ialah pulang kembali ke tempat asalku sebab itulah tak ada keinginanku bertualang mencari maharaja simurgh
3576529 aku telah biasa hidup dalam kesucian dan sudah terbiasa berenang di air yang lain tak kurindukan lagi aku tak sanggup keluar dari genangan air dan tak bisa hidup di tempat yang kering kerontang
3576530 aku sudah biasa hidup senang di gunung bagaimanakah aku akan sanggup meninggalkan tempat semayamku yang menyenangkan
3576531 aku hanseekor burung mungil dan lemah takkan mungkin burung sekecil aku ini sanggup mengembara sejauh itu
3576532 saudara saudaraku yang tercinta kalian sudah tahu bukan bahwa kedudukanku tinggi sekali di sisi raja mana mungkin aku meninggalkan kedudukan semulia itu
3576533 o hudhud karena kau lebih mengetahui jalan menuju temapt raja yang kau ceritakan itu dan kau yang menginginkan kami menyertaimu sedang bagi kami jalan itu gelap gulita sebaiknya kau sendirilah yang pergi dalam kegelapan semacam itu apalagi banyak sekali bahaya yang mengancam sepanjang perjalanan pasti kami tak bisa menyertai perjalananmu menghadap raja
3576534 ingat aku tak boleh lalai menyampaikan nasihatku yang baik kepada kalian semua niatku suci apa yang menyebabkan kalian semua mencari alasan yang bermacam macam apakah hanya karena terbiasa hidup enak dan mengapa harus kita biarkan terlantar cita cita kita yang suci ini karena terikat kesenangan azam yang kuat dan hati yang teguh serta sabar akan mampu memusnahkan segala kesulitan dan menjadikan dekat segala yang jauh
3576535 lalu dengan cara bagaimana dan melalui jalan apa saja agar kita sampai ke tempat yang jauh dan sulit itu dan dengan perlengkapan apa pula kita bisa sampai ke istana maharaja simurgh
3576536 kita harus menyeberangi tujuh lembah baru kita akan sampai di tempat maharaja simurgh tak ada yang bisa lagi kembali ke dunia bilamana telah menempuh perjalanan yang maha jauh itu dan mustahil pula kita bisa menyebutkan berapa banyak rintangan yang akan kita temui sabarlah bertaqwalah kepada tuhan karena bila kalian telah sanggup menempuh perjalanan itu kalian akan tetap berada dalam diri kalian buat selama lamanya
3576537 lembah pertama adalah lembah pencarian kedua lembah cinta ketiga lembah pemahaman keempat lembah kebebasan dan kelepasan kelima lembah kesatuan sejati keenam lembah ketakjuban dan ketujuh lembah kefakiran dan kefanaan di balik itu tak ada lagi apa apa
3576538 o kau yang lebih gemilang dari surya matahari padam oleh sinar mu dan menjelma atom bagaimana pulakah dengan kami yang kecil ini jauh dan penuh derita perjalanan yang telah kami tempuh adakah kami akan sia sia kami telah meninggalkan diri kami dan bebas dari belenggu benda benda dunia akan gagalkah kami bertemu raja kami betapa kecilnya kami di sini dan tak tahu apakah kami ini ada atau tidak
3576539 dari manakah kalian datang o burung burung apa yang kalian lakukan di sini siapa saja nama kalian betapa sengsaranya kalian di manakah rumah kalian apa yang bisa kalian kerjakan sebagai makhluk yang lemah di tempat ini
3576540 untuk menghadap raja kami simurgh karena begitu rindu dan cintanya kami kepada baginda beginilah akhirnya kami kebingungan dan pusing dulu ketika kami berangkat jumlah kami ribuan dan kini kami hanya tinggal tiga puluh ekor kami tak yakin raja kami akan memperlakukan kami penuh penghinaan seperti ini karena perjalanan yang kami tempuh demikian sukar dan penuh penderitaan oh tidak baginda harus menyambut kami dan menerima kami dengan penuh kasih sayang
3576541 o burung burung yang kebingungan dan kesulitan apakah kau ada atau tidak raja tetap ada dan abadi ribuan makhluk di dunia tak lebih dari semut di depan gapuranya apalagi kalian kalian kemari tak membawa sesuatu apa pun kecuali ratap tangis dan sedu sedan kembali sajalah kalian ke tempat kalian datang o makhluk yang hina dina
3576542 bila seluruh umat manusia di bumi ini menyanyikan puji pujian bagiku aku takkan menerimanya aku lebih suka penghinaan leila sebuah penghinaan yang diberikan leila bagiku jauh lebih baik dari ribuan pujian dari perempuan yang lain
3576543 dan semua nyawa akan hangus bila roh sirna oleh ratusan dukacita pahala apa yang akan diperoleh anugerah apa yang akan kalian terima dalam sekejap ini
3576544 bagaimana laron bisa mengelak dari nyala lilin apabila dia ingin menyatu dengan cahaya lilin sahabat yang kami cari pasti membuat hati kami senang bilamana kami dikabulkan berkumpul dengannya bila kami sekarang ditolak buat berjumpa apalagi yang harus kami lakukan kami laksana laron yang ingin menyatu dengan nyala lilin kami mohon bukan lantaran dungu karena tujuan kami adalah mensucikan diri dan kami yakin ucapan kami ini akan membuat hatinya senang serta berterima kasih karenanya bukankah bagindatelah berkata barangsiapa yang menyerahkan seluruh hatinya pada nyala apinya takkan ada kesulitan yang merintangi dirinya
3576545 matahari kebesaranku adalah sebuah cermin dia yang melihat dirinya sendiri akan melihat jiwa dan tubuhnya dan akan melihatnya dengan sempurna karna kalian datang sebanyak tigapuluh ekor
3576546 dapatkah penglihatan seekor semut mencapai bintang soraya yang jauh dan dapatkah serangga kecil ini mengangkat tempat pijaknya pernah kau lihat seekor nyamuk mengangkat seekor gajah dengan giginya segala yang kau ketahui segala yang telah kau lihat segala yang telah kau katakan atau kau dengar semua ini bukan itu lagi bilamana kalian telah menyeberangi lembah jalan kerohanian dan bilamana kalian telah memenuhi kewajiban dengan baik kalian akan menjadi seperti ini berkat tindakanku dan kalian sanggup melihat lembah hakikat dan kesempurnaanku kalian yang jumlahnya tiga puluh ekor takjub tercengang dan kagum tapi aku lebih dari tiga puluh ekor burung aku adalah hakekat yang sesungguhnya dari simurgh yang sebenarnya leburkan diri kalian dengan bangga dan penuh sukacita ke dalam aku dan di dalam aku kalian akan menemukan diri kalian

3576560 but our approach is to stay calm try and stay relaxed and not to think about added pressure
3576561 i honestly thought i was going to play defensive back thats what the coaches told me and what a lot of the guys wanted me to do but when i got there they were having a lot of receiver problems
3576562 thats all i remember is them saying were going to give you a shot at wide receiver and i was like ok i was just happy to be there
3576563 hes got great skill hes fast i mean his athletic ability is special
3576564 its a tough situation that happened to bobby thats our mentor hes our ambassador
3576565 hes a guy who we really look up to but weve still got to go play

3576579 shall i tell the brave adventures of the colonial fleet against the cylons again
3576580 i want you to tell the story of what happened right after the fleet first reached this solar system
3576581 you never tell that story all your stories end when galactica meets serenity and then we all live happily ever after but there has to be more story than that how did mother go from being a president to being a senator how did we get this house what happened tell that story dad
3576582 its not really a very exciting story ben mostly there are politics and meeting people and girl things
3576583 you told me calling something girl things is just a way to deni deni say impolite things
3576584 i want to know what happened after you met mal and the serenity crew
3576585 the first thing that happened after finding serenity was that we met with the alliance
3576586 and the alliance well that was when they were greedier and eviler than they are now and they told us they thought a fair price for us settling was everything we had and four years indenture to boot
3576587 but the colonials are the bravest folk in the whole verse theyve asked mother to be president five times and you twice
3576588 at the time we didnt know each other so well
3576589 we were refugees with shiny new guns ftl drives and cylons chasing us and i was tired and discouraged and two months pregnant with you we didnt seem a threat
3576590 as you wish o true son of your illustrious mother
3576591 have we got the right of how these people are all related yet
3576592 i never cease to be surprised found out just yesterday that miz president roslins a married lady
3576593 i knew that first thing one of the guards called her mrs adama and so i asked it aint no secret captain
3576594 so shes married to the admiral i suppose explains why the young captain attends to her so smart speaks well of him tendin his stepma so
3576595 young devoted cute and cant keep his hands off her and vice versa
3576596 i caught em at it on the shuttle the other day they remind me of zoe and wash some i think its why zoe keeps away from them it must pain her some to see a couple that happy
3576597 we should get you pants like his husband of mine
3576598 youre spending a lot of time with mal and he is terribly pretty and now i find you like his pants
3576599 two months and counting o creator of my newest lump
3576600 just the alliance malcolm reynoldss intentions and everyone and everything else in this frakked situation
3576601 right smart of you captain got yourself a fine woman
3576602 not much but dont worry none theyll settle you captain alliance is scared of your wife
3576603 word spreads and shes mighty popular out here in the rim ever since those articles of colonization were disseminated the alliance has had nothing but trouble brewing folk think mrs adama would make an excellent leader once shes a full citizen here
3576604 mal i dont want to run for any office that was never my intention in fact i plan to retire once the colonial people are settled
3576605 youre clearly a good damn leader and this job is worth doing right madam president
3576606 however my wife is pregnant and so it is important that she get settled as soon as
3576607 what the guay are you doing listening like that these is sensitive negotiations not inaras latest clients to ogle
3576608 wasnt ogling alliance is asking permission to start dockin with serenity captain
3576609 theres big problems two cylon raiders crossed the line and alliance could barely shut em down even with the tips the colonials gave em they lost eighteen ships just getting one
3576610 its terrifying really i should be expecting my first grandchild not my firstborn but here i am
3576611 and what mal said you know about being a leader he sprung it on you wrong said it all wrong too
3576612 stop hasslin miz roslin on the subject if she dont want to do it she dont need to consider it
3576613 and simon dr tam my boyfriend very smart and educated he says that your form of government could bring a much needed revolution to this system he read all the articles of colonization once they were translated and he thinks even them on the central planets will cotton to em once things get out about miranda
3576614 all of this can be true without needing me to do more than surrender my power and agree not to run for office if what youre saying is true i ought to agree to that
3576615 youre more than likely the most powerful person in this verse right now and if you just retire to a little cabin on some gorram rock alliancell think its won and it has to be you folks are scared of the military the colonies have but if it were you theyd just think you was a nice lady and now that youre going to have a baby theyd underestimate you something fierce
3576616 and the colonies will need serious representation in the parliament
3576617 its why i suggested that the colonies have a senator until final settlement agreements were pounded out
3576618 i bet theyll give you a nice house with a nursery and servants if you was the leader of the colonial contingent
3576619 if the cylons dont come and kill us all first
3576620 speaking of cylons your husband ran off this boat awful damn fast are we in any immediate danger
3576621 so far the defenses are holding but the alliance will be playing hardball with us now that weve definitely brought the cylon threat to this system
3576622 i think our position in these negotiations has just changed
3576623 let us not forget that you are asking us out of the goodness of our hearts to settle nearly fifty thousand destitute refugees on our worlds without even mentioning renumeration
3576624 worse yet you just happen to have brought an incredible military threat in the form of these improbable evil and impossible to detect robots im afraid all of this is out of the question
3576625 youd agreed to everything before you even agreed to come visit serenity what do you think youre doing now changing your mind about the basic tenets of the agreement
3576626 this was before the colonials brought the cylon attack down upon us
3576627 things have changed mr artimer but i am still the president of the twelve colonies and at this point the president of the alliance if i so choose you have no authority to make me your prisoner
3576628 youre the president of no one and nothing at all
3576629 i have nothing except weapons that will repel the cylon attacks and the strong and absolute loyalty of the 50 000 people who stand between you and genocide
3576630 the situation has most definitely changed before you intended to beggar the colonies and force assimilation and indentured servitude because we have what you want and you have what we need but terms are different the cylon threat is real and my military is the only force that can prevent the demise of the alliance furthermore i have recently learned the alliance is a corrupt and illegitimate government and that their major purpose in these negotiations is to prevent any chance that i gain any power
3576631 my kind of people seeing real alliance hospitality firsthand so listen to me artimer and listen close i dont have time for your petty power plays or the alliances scheming you will grant my people asylum and status as permanent residents of the alliance or my people including galactica and its staff will leave your system immediately do you understand
3576632 im the leader of my people you are a third rate bully with the brain of an ant so much so in fact that i am going to dictate a new treaty and you will return to the alliance with it within the hour and it will be approved or i will leave and you can try negotiating with cylons
3576633 we dont have a lot of time here if we dont want to be bait
3576634 the alliance has been perilously misinformed by our intelligence as to your
3576635 we here on serenity do find president roslin to have some pretty shiny skills that its hard to understate
3576636 truthfully maam you look like a back country schoolmarm and now im sitting here a believer you really ought to warn people
3576637 appearances mr artimer are vital in my line of work
3576638 you all ruttin know the ladys the best man for the job whynt you just say so and let her be the senator president without all the fuss
3576639 if wed wanted a well meaning dictatorship we could have had one we nearly had our own civil war over the question i cant just change my mind now
3576640 shes asked him to keep it quiet because she thinks its her punishment
3576641 instead of dying so everyone could get to earth she decided to live and now theres going to be a baby but thats just crazy talk she didnt lose it earth lost itself if shed died shed just be dead and earth would still be missing and we need her to finish the job first
3576642 so thats the news lee knocked the president up thats not really all that surprising given the number of times i and half of galactica have caught those two sneaking off
3576643 apollo let his wife get more power than admiral adama feels is rightly proper for her to have but hes got no say in it and it was better than the original plan which was for the colonials to overthrow the alliance and put her in charge
3576644 dont we send lee with president roslin to keep her clever political forays from overdoing themselves i swear that woman is more trouble than shes worth
3576645 shes saving the world its hard work and no one else does it better
3576646 but it does make the day to day kind of frakking hellish
3576647 so yeah ill say you know her or will soon enough
3576648 ye gods men and monsters you could house every last person on colonial one here and still have room to spare
3576649 well some of them some preferred the so called servants quarters and some have apartments in the city and yes there are still three guest rooms
3576650 gods my father is going to have a frakking fit when he sees this
3576651 everything else no idea at all however i do know what i like the best about this room
3576652 i havent had a decent bed in nearly a year
3576653 i am going to enjoy this bed beyond all measure
3576654 i intend to make a small fort to hide myself when im tired also ive heard theyre wonderful weapons
3576655 we can share unless you snore then all bets are off
3576656 i see that senator roslin hasnt yet graced us with her presence either
3576657 anyone aint caught these two sneaking off or worse i myself have walked in on an encounter or two so im sure the admirals had occasion to see
3576658 jayne you come with me im sure its the heat and miz roslins condition has them sleepy
3576659 mal what the hell are you talking about you know as well as i do they aint sleepy or if they are its because they spent the whole day screwin
3576660 its pretty clear he fancied that woman at one point or another and its not something a man wants to hear in general that his sons been spending his day recreating the day of baby making with a woman he wanted
3576661 nor none of the hanky panky i heard from halfway down the hallway but you cant tell me old man doesnt know why his son and his beloved bride aint here to greet em
3576662 bill is always impatient he can wait a bit longer
3576663 its time to get out of that bed i think
3576664 five thirty oh gods frak i thought it was only two gentlemen this is what happens when you have a handsome young husband whos being dragged away from you go tell bill that im on my way downstairs
3576665 didnt quite get it at first not with that hotshot starbuck running around and them fine young women all over the ship but now well i seem to recall them disappearing just after breakfast so i reckon captain apollo knew was he was about after all
3576666 pretty husband power a nice estate and ive heard tell shes some kind of holy lady cant hardly be natural getting all that done in a day
3576667 you keep your eyes where they belong when the senator makes her way downstairs or i aint gonna protect you when her or either of those men flay you for looking the wrong way
3576668 and you need to look happier things are going very well here if i got away with spending my whole day with my husband and you know it
3576669 given that the chances of miscarriage or birth defect in this pregnancy are astronomically high i didnt want to give anyone false alarm
3576670 so when were you going to mention it to me sometime before the birth i imagine
3576671 were still friends and this is something i should have known
3576672 youre still harboring that foolish notion that this is your fault arent you
3576673 how many times are you going to sacrifice yourself for the rest of us laura weve found earth or as near as well get until the cylons are finally put down youve found us a home and now youre even going to atone for the heinous sin of living by bringing these poor bastards some kind of decent civilian democracy
3576674 be happy or not thats your choice but i want you to stop blaming yourself because earth that was wasnt a fairy tale ending its not your fault
3576675 you might want to put in some soundproofing in the walls captain way your wife hollers itd be an investment
3576676 i thought to keep zoe on as captain in my absence but theres been a snag youd heard what happened when we went to miranda right
3576677 zoe here seems to have a death wish and thats not doing no one no good on serenity and so im asking you a favor
3576678 well considering your chief political ally and husbands been packed off to the black for a few months im thinking zoe would do well as your bodyguard
3576679 like how billys your chief of staff and captain apollo was your chief husband zoe knows how to follow a man into battle
3576680 but i dont much fancy managing servants or cooking rice pudding for you
3576681 and i dont much fancy you getting yourself killed from grief
3576682 senator needs a solid person here one who knows the customs already i aint givin you up easy
3576683 mal i think zoe and i need to speak privately
3576684 you do that ill come back soonish to hear how you twove decided what arrangement youre like to take up
3576685 just dont see the use in valiantly avoiding it anymore and there is a war on
3576686 you lost everything and everyone when the cylons took your worlds and you kept fighting
3576687 the day the cylons came i found out i was dying of terminal breast cancer and not long after that i found out it was my destiny to find earth and die and i did that i found the map to earth and after that i made my peace with dying like you i wasnt trying to die i just wasnt avoiding it anymore
3576688 and then a man named baltar gave me to the cylons and they healed me while taking my visions
3576689 you know how i felt glad to be alive and as you can imagine i didnt waste any time had captain adama in my bed within the week and had him begging to marry me the next month
3576690 then i found out there was going to be a baby
3576691 and right after that we found this system and i realized i had done a terrible selfish thing
3576692 that you being happy you living means you fouled up your prophecy worse is that it
3576693 i keep thinking that if i could just die things will turn out right
3576694 that the fleet will go to earth and discover its recovered will find a way to stop the cylons for good that lee wont be trapped with an old woman for another forty years
3576695 maam i respect you and your religion but thats fei oo and you know it no god or gods is going to punish a woman for being happy and if they do hell with em you dont need em none
3576696 i cant save you from your grief nor would i want to but i can make you a deal you keep my foolishness from getting me killed and ill do the same for you and we can judge each other harshly and mourn over tea
3576697 i wanted children for me and wash and ill add again you are full of go se you talk about wishing youd die but then you take that young husband of yours and screw him silly for the whole day you dont want to die at all you just want things to have a shiny ending where you dont have to work so hard
3576698 i fought cancer humanoid looking robots terrorists death threats lees father and the whole damn fleets disapproval to have my man and my baby havent i done enough why should i have to keep fighting
3576699 same reason mals gone from being an outlaw and petty thief to bein damn near respectable and a politician
3576700 youre the type as craves justice and rightness for everyone and not just your own a damnfool altruist even if youre better off minding your own business you have to meddle so i say better you meddle for good reason and use that political clout than find yourself with a broken down firefly playing outlaw maam itll keep you occupied while youre waiting for the baby
3576701 no offense to you but your militarys full of stiffs with sticks up their pi gu i think they deserve jayne in charge of the ship and if it doesnt work out mal can find a new crew member to be first officer we need new ones anyway losing my husband and the shepherd so recently cheap bastard was using river for the pilot until galactica stole her from us
3576702 now thats settled i want you to understand that while i understand the need for a bodyguard your primary job when youre working for me is to be my cultural liaison
3576703 it means you have to teach me about this insane culture of yours before i throw up my hands
3576704 i keep finding myself adrift and confused by the nuances for example all of you swear in that other language of yours i have no idea what go se means for example nor what you eat for breakfast in this damn place nor why the girl this morning said i shouldnt wear white
3576705 and the girl this morning isnt dressing you any more she makes you look like a dowdy old matron and that is not how i imagine you want to look
3576706 im tired of people using the schoolmarm jibe to undermine me politically id rather look like an evil overlord than a mild mannered schoolteacher in this lions den
3576707 and theres the first thing you can learn to say in chinese xie xie means thank you
3576708 you ready to dazzle your enemies and support president keikeya in his first public appearance on persephone senator roslin
3576709 after all the drawing rooms of persephone were how i learned how to manipulate political gain in this system remember
3576710 do you remember when i came home when you were announcing your confinement just before ben was born that gown you were wearing
3576711 and eating lots of strawberries and cream and red bean paste
3576712 oh by the way um i have a business trip coming up i have to head up to vermont for about a week now i know youve always wanted to go there so youre more than welcome to come along wed just have to scrape the money together for another train ticket
3576713 la carrera de san juan es importante para nosotros para demostrar que podemos ser candidatos a estar entre los mejores de aqu en adelante el circuito me gusta mucho pero hay que transitarlo con mucho cuidado porque no perdona el equipo que dirigen gustavo tadei y sebasti n maiale ha trabajado mucho en el auto con el objetivo de poder recuperarlo de una carrera que no fue muy auspiciosa para nosotros como la plata el objetivo en san juan es poder sumar puntos importantes en funci n de ascender en el campeonato agradezco a todo el equipo y a los sponsor que nos acompa an
3576714 just a few years ago china never would have been able to pull that off
3576715 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3576716 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3576717 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3576718 we have green and red stickers which ones best for you
3576719 oh forgot you get these when you buy a ticket today
3576720 i warned you it would lead to this holmes i warned you over and over but you wouldnt listen
3576721 a bit of fresh air that might help sort you out
3576722 what i need is a full syringe of give me that letter watson
3576723 oh come now holmes surely you dont suspect the letter is a trap of some sort poisonous paper perhaps a corrosive powder hidden within
3576724 my dearest watson after so many years observing me how can you know so dreadfully little about my methods
3576725 this envelope is of plain quality suggesting that the sender wished to conceal their status
3576726 it was sent via standard post fit to contain but one sheet of paper however the weight of the letter within suggests that the stock is heavier than normal and thus more expensive i suspect the woman has done well for herself but did not wish anyone to know it
3576727 as there are no international postal marks on the envelope i can only surmise that it was sent from within the city
3576728 irene adler is here but holmes thats fantastic we must go find her
3576729 sit down watson we dont even know what is written within
3576730 how in the bloody hell do you even know it is from her
3576731 im an invalid because of your damn worries watson i can barely keep my eyes focused nor my stomach from curling fetch the bottle from the mantle and my moroccan case
3576732 ill do no such thing and ill not allow you to either give me the letter and the blade and ill remove it
3576733 ive removed bullets from the lungs of wounded soldiers on the battlefields of africa sir i can manage your letter i think
3576734 i say are you certain you want me to read this to you perhaps it could wait until you are better
3576735 please read it to me without hesitation my dear fellow i am in your debt be careful not to miss a single word particularly any that are scribbled out or deliberately covered over you must make every effort to read the letter as carefully as if i were doing it myself
3576736 there is no way she could know that someone must have revealed your pen name
3576737 you were the only person who knew id taken up an interest in our cousins or that id been writing about them did you tell anyone
3576738 how could she have possibly deciphered who you really were
3576739 she is my equal in powers of the mind please continue
3576740 that appears to be all there is to the letter no signature no farewell nothing
3576741 once you can look beyond the obvious a whole host of possibilities becomes glaringly apparent my dear doctor
3576742 i dont care how bad a book is burning it is a travesty
3576743 god bless the broken road that led me streight to you
3576744 what are you doing get that out of my car
3576745 no get out and throw that out dont leave it in the street
3576746 dude quit swaying your cup of red wine back and forth youre gonna spill it
3576747 they foreign films inoculate us with messages that have nothing to do with our traditions
3576748 hollywood sends a message to the world that tries to sustain the so called american way of life and imperialism
3576749 later i went to caracas to study psychology in the central university
3576750 i started to work as an usher after that i began to organize film festivals
3576751 and how people might become participants in the development of film through their own art
3576752 to listen and learn not only from government and opposition politicians but to share with the people those who are promoting the changes in this country and we want to be in contact with those who benefit from those changes
3576753 the visit by members of the transafrica forum represents a struggle that goes beyond the figure of martin luther king his struggle his ideas and the african american social movements inspired by him this is a struggle aimed at defending peoples rights not only in the united states but in the hemisphere and the world
3576754 this isnt danny glover the artist im here as a citizen not only of the u s but a citizen of the world we understand fully the importance of this historical moment
3576755 social forum on poverty and justice in a globalized world
3576756 the use of radio and tv airspace as a public asset
3576757 people in the united states dont participate in a dialogue that allows them to see that they have the power of information
3576758 we see the positions that the media take and people should take that power back and make themselves the architects of the media
3576759 we have a very fraternal relationship with glover he came here to villa del cine in 2006 hes interested in developing some film productions
3576760 demoralising and detrimental to future generations of venezuelan movie makers
3576761 what worries us is this trend for neo colonisation by international figures who come to talk of their support for ch vezs government and leave with money for their projects
3576762 the funds earmarked for this movie will be invested exclusively in venezuela creating jobs and providing excellent experience for our national film industry
3576763 we dont have anything personal against glover and it even seems good to expand our relations with the movie industry but the quantity of money is excessive and it fails to consider the efforts of venezuelan moviemakers who cant even get 450 000 to make a film
3576764 an error a lack of reflection it puts all the eggs in one basket
3576765 they say that the artists will be 30 per cent venezuelan and 70 per cent foreign
3576766 we want to know how this co production will work and whether the money that the government is investing will include paying the artists if you have hollywood actors charging hollywood salaries then the budget will go on just two or three actors
3576767 in a country with rampant poverty a catastrophic health crisis and 14 000 violent deaths a year president hugo ch vez gives away our money for his friends to play with
3576768 legitimate representatives of universal cinematography they represent themselves they are small groups with a monetary vision
3576769 we are looking to make good films no matter what the script we really want writers and directors to come to us with their ideas if theyre good well support them
3576770 received various different proposals and of the ones which won commissions none was linked with politics
3576771 this film toussaint will form part of our ideological canon against metro goldwyn mayer mgm
3576772 we had the first successful anti slave rebellion in this hemisphere its our contribution to humanity if glover can take this story to the big screen we will be happy
3576773 we know that march 12 1806 two years after haiti became a republic exactly two centuries ago and a year a very great venezuelan cried out for independence
3576774 and it is here in a revolutionary boat with a revolutionary crew that the venezuelan flag was hoisted for the first time francisco de miranda as you know was that great venezuela and the reason for our visit is linked to what he did way back then
3576775 we are very conscious of what the haitian people are a people who were able to defeat empires and free their country well before the rest of latin america and the caribbean a heroic people and also a ravaged people over the past two centuries you must also know that bol var passed through here in 1816 when in venezuela all appeared lost in the battle against spain
3576776 all of this history has to do with why i am here today
3576777 today i feel i am paying part of our historic debt to haiti and i say this after more than 8 years in government this is the first time i visit haiti i should have come here earlier

3576815 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3576816 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3576817 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3576818 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3576819 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3576820 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
3576821 whatever mistakes tblisi has made they cannot justify russias actions
3576822 moscow has invaded a neighbor an illegal act of aggression that violates the u n charter and fundamental principles of cooperation and security in europe
3576823 beginning a well planned war as the olympics were opening violates the ancient tradition of a truce to conflict during the games
3576824 had ik maar genoeg geld om dit of dat te kunnen verwezenlijken
3576825 streetkids in durban mee te lopen hermien had dit voorgesteld om samen een dagje met haar mee te rijden in de ambulance in durban ik vond dit een geweldig idee zou op deze manier nog meer ervaring opdoen hetgeen ik misschien weer zou kunnen gebruiken voor k s het project waar ik dus nu verblijf en mij voor inzet hier en strakjes thuis om 8 am kwamen we aan bij uthombo het project dat zich inzet voor streetkids d m v outreachwork geven van medicatie doorverwijzingen naar zhuizen opvang luisterend oor soms workshops etc bij uthombo zelf slapen ook veel kids buiten zie foto dus bij aankomst werden we al omringd door deze jongeren en ik raakte al snel aan de praat mijn favoriete doelgroep zijn pubers en deze vormen de grootste groep onder de straatkids met enkele jongere kids en jong volwassenen ik voelde me totaal op mn gemak en liep overal naar toe in tussen totdat hermien mij kwam zoeken ze waren me al een tijdje kwijt of ik ok was natuurlijk ik had mooie gesprekken met de kids en ze wilden me van alles laten zien maar hermien had gelijk het is niet altijd zonder gevaar ik had op gegeven moment ook een hand in mijn zak te graaien naar wat hier in zat maar ik duwde rustig de hand weg ik ging met hermien en lilian en de chauffeur eugene n heerlijke warme zuluman op stap met de ambulance zie foto 2 andere vrouwen van dit project gingen een worskhop armbanden maken van kralen doen met enkele achtergebleven kids zodat we niet met teveel in de ambu zouden zitten erg aardig deze ambu is ook niet te vergelijken met de ned ambulances omdat de projectmedewerkers niet bevoegd zijn hier in za om sommige medische handelingen te verrichten ondanks dat ze in europa verpleegster of dokter zijn erg jammer maar hier komt hopelijk verandering in door in de toekomst toch 1 bevoegd iemand mee te laten rijden hermien o a pleit hiervoor we gingen eerst naar een vluchtelingenkamp hier in durban misschien kunnen jullie de verhalen uit de kranten van kortgeleden nog herinneren over de slachting van buitenlanders in za door zuid afrikanen omdat ze vonden vinden dat deze buitenlanders mensen uit bv zimbabwe malawi congo burundi etc hun banen afpakten nu de slachting is minder maar het gevaar voor deze buitenlanders is er nog steeds begrijpelijk dat de za boos zijn omdat de werkloosheid hier erg hoog is maar richt die dan op de regering en niet op deze mensen we kwamen dus aan bij 3 grote tenten en hier verbleven vnl mensen uit congo en burundi hier slapen zon 187 mensen die op dit moment nog een uitzichtloos bestaan leiden de overheid doet nog niets wat doen ze w l en ze zijn hier niet veilig volgens een inteligente man die ik sprak hij had voor de slachting een goede baan in de stad maar moest dus vluchten voor de opgekomen haat onder de mensen nu durft hij nog niet terug te gaan en om zijn gezin te beschermen verblijft hij nu hier onder de mensen hij kan ook niet terug naar zijn geboorteland congo omdat zijn vader een belangrijk man was vermoord en hij bang is zelf vermoord te worden als hij terugkeert echt zielig om aan te horen al die mensen die maar zitten te wachten op een veiliger manier van leven een baan een eigen huis gisteren werd hermien hier geintervieuwd door de pers over haar rol in dit vluchtelingenkamp en werk bij uthombo vandaag stond dit in de krant een groot artikel en we kochten deze krant van een streetkids op de straat je kunt hier meer over lezen op weblog hermien dit soort dingen zijn erg belangrijk aandacht in de media zodat hopelijk hopelijk deze mensen binnenkort een menswaardig bestaan mogen gaan leiden hermien had mij gevraagd om wat engelse boeken mee te nemen en een bal die ik o a mee uit nederland had genomen om hier te doneren gunter had nog over van hetgeen ik destijds aan hem had gegeven en ik heb een deel hiervan dus gedoneerd aan de kids hier zie fotos de kinderen waren hier erg blij mee kun je je voorstellen er is hier g n speelgoed echt helemaal niets dus de boeken en bal waren zeer welkom en ik vond het ontroerend om te zien hoe blij ze waren jane weer kinderen blij gemaakt met veel van jouw boeken hierna gingen we en route op zoek naar de streetkids we hebben verschillende kids op verschillende plekken gezien ze doen veel met me ik zie mijzelf wel onder deze jongeren begeven in de toekomst spellen met ze doen en praatjes met ze maken het is aandoenlijk nee ontroerend om te zien hoe de jongeren voor elkaar opkomen hoe veels te grote colbert jassen worden gedragen door de kleine jongens en wat een hoge pijngrens ze hebben bijna allemaal zijn ze high van de lijm die ze snuiven hetgeen hersenbeschadiging kan geven sommige met draaierige ogen veels te jong om al alleen op straat te leven leeftijden gezien van 10 18 jaar meisjes en jongens althans vandaag meisjes van 14 15 jaar die om een zwangerschapstest vragen kids met vaak vieze wonden op voeten die nooit schoenen hebben gedragen het grootste medische probleem vandaag denk ik was het hoesten en pijn in de longen hetgeen wordt veroorzaakt door snuiven van lijm zie foto en natuurlijk leven op straat en het verzorgen van steek wonden of bloed in urine ik vond het mooi om hermien bezig te zien 1 voor 1 mochten de kids plaatsnemen in de ambu en vertelden hun verhaal soms met eugene als tolk daarna kregen ze medicijnen van hermien voor maar enkele dagen zodat ze bij evt overdosis het wel zouden overleven maar ook om ze weer terug te zien om ze zo in de gaten te kunnen houden je ziet onder de kids ook echt groepsvorming de ene groep zit vaak op zonnige gebieden de andere dicht bij umthombo de andere in een steegje in de stad de ander bij het strand op een heuvel en weer andere bij de haven ook zie je bij de ene groep meer lijm jongeren dan bij de andere de groep die geen lijm snuiven zijn veel minder hyper en beter aanspreekbaar tussendoor hebben we gedrieen even geluncht op het strand zie foto om zo even de meeste indrukken ook te verwerken en even uit de sfeer en geuren te komen dit was echt even nodig maar hoe heftig dit project ook is ik voelde me kalm en veilig maar je moet wel altijd op je hoede zijn er kan elk moment van alles gebeuren ook had ik nog een telefoontje gehad van de moeder van de patient van gisteren om te zeggen dat ze bij haar dochter op bezoek ging ik vertelde dat wij misschien ook nog even langs kwamen maar waarom belde ze eigenlijk nou ja toch even attent einde middag nam ik afscheid van hermlizz had al telefoon van de moeder gehadien eugene en andere vrijwilligers hermien ga ik nu pas weer zien als ik naar het vliegveld gebracht word zaterdag maar hier wil ik nog niet aan denken hierna gingen lilian en ik naar het zhuis waar we op bezoek wilden gaan bij onze patient bleek dat ze al was ontslagen lilian belde met de moeder en deze klonk oprecht blij dat haar dochter weer thuis was en veel at onze enigste concern is dat ze hopelijk niet de dochter naar huis heeft laten gaan op eigen risico omdat ze de kosten voor medicatie niet wilde betalen we gaan binnenkort even kijken toch geeft het me ook wel n lekker gevoel dat ze uit dat zhuis weg is en dat ze blijkbaar voldoende is aangesterkt en onslagen kon worden om verder thuis aan te sterken toen lilian en ik het zhuis binnen liepen zag ik de hoofden van de verplegers al omdraaien en daarna met elkaar smoezen over ons ik vond dit toch wel kostelijk ze dachten vast van daar heb je ze weer wat willen ze nu

3576929 absolutely not the gimmick that the republicans have come up with drill drill drill in the protected areas and it will bring down the price of oil is a complete misrepresneation to the american people there are plenty of places weve had to drill at 68 million acres in the lower 48 where people can drill more than 10 million acres in alaska which are permitted for drilling

3576943 we have issued advertisements inviting applications to the post of coordinator people living with hiv aids plha only from candidates who are hiv positive earlier we had set this as a desirable factor but then we decided to make it an essential one
3576944 right now in kerala we have what is called drop in centres they work to facilitate grouping or association of people with hiv aids the belief is that when they come together they would get to share their problems and it would be a great relaxing factor
3576945 the aim of reserving the post is to reach out to them we believe that a lifestyle modification may be possible if somebody who understands their problem better is in charge it will also help us send out our message in a better way as the channel of communication will be better
3576946 this is a very positive step the best way to fight the disease is to break the confidentiality which is maintained by those affected by it to avoid the associated stigma
3576947 when nelson mandelas son died of aids he had said that the hiv affected should break the confidentiality
3576948 they should be encouraged to come forward as confidentiality can only lead to their isolation

3576956 every time i watch him swim im more and more in awe of what he does
3576957 being his teammate and being part of the team while hes doing all this kind of gives us a different perspective i think years and years down the road well realize more and more how amazing and special he is
3576958 its always just one more step when youre kind of at the top of the mountain the steps are pretty high even one more step takes you pretty far away from everyone else
3576959 i could not believe how comfortable i felt wearing this undergarment i had no chaffing or rubbing it just worked perfectly and for the first time i was warm

3576972 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3576973 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3576974 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3576975 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3576976 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning

3576991 the campaign is not too short and not too long
3576992 its longer than call of duty 4 its shorter than a final fantasy game its different for different players when the end starts to come you want it to come but when you get there you want more its really well crafted
3576993 notice how im talking in terms of feelings instead of in terms of number of hours thats important it permeates everything we do the stats arent important the feelings and experiences we have are
3576994 a game im not interested in can be 100 000 hours long and i dont care maybe if it was one hour and all the attention was put on that one hour the game might be something i could get interested in meanwhile if something is awesome but too short i dont feel value for my investment the goal is to find the sweet spot

3576999 i came off that turn and felt like i really didnt spend much energy on the way out
3577000 and just used that extra energy in the second lap and i think it worked pretty well
3577001 i just swam my own race completely this morning and couldnt have done anything better
3577002 obviously when you hear the crowd cheer you realise what it was
3577003 i heard it was only point 0 faster than what i did so i knew i had a shot
3577004 it gives me confidence that i know i can swim my own race under pressure
3577005 having that world record go before me i knew i had to swim my own race and not get drawn into the games about times
3577006 i came out on top and im happy with the way i swam
3577007 i dont think ill have an outside lane for the final tomorrow
3577008 so i can be close to the action in lane four
3577009 i was talking to eamon before the race and he said you have to go sub 48 seconds to make the final

3577011 we were determined to bring the very best forthcoming games to the showdown and weve certainly achieved that with left 4 dead were hugely excited to be able to show it to pc gamer showdown attendees as were sure its going to be one of the top games of 2008 and live up to valves fearsomely high standards

3577014 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3577015 mr tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election his party the mdc won a parliamentary majority
3577016 we know that mr mutambara has a breakaway group of the mdc they have been involved in the talks as well but any outcome which emerged which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce
3577017 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3577018 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3577019 i saw that big smile and was like yup its her first time
3577020 i hope the british board of film classification bbfc will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification
3577021 what the rest of world does is up to them we need to ensure that modern and civilised values take priority rather than killing and maiming people
3577022 it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii
3577023 i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii

3577026 following are some tantric foreplay moves you can try tonight one studies show that most people engage only the upper part of their bodies and each others faces during foreplay since were after full body pleasure here start from the bottom up massage her feet and toes and try some licking and sucking there move up and gently massage her legs or use some other texture fabric e g velvet silk etc to caress her legs extend her leg up and lick the back of her leg blow at the back of her knees stroke inner and outer portions of her thighs did you know that doing this helps increase blood flow to the genitals two use your teeth gentle nibbling is encouraged dont bite when youre caressing her thighs go down and nibble at the fleshiest part a little bit when youre going down on her a few very gentle nibbles on her labia are encouraged when you move upwards to her breasts nibble around her areola you may try and tug or gently bite her nipples but be sensitive to how she reacts to this three blindfold her blindfolding entails a lot of trust in each other so dont push this if shes not ready furthermore dont encourage anything or do anything youre not willing to try yourself so why try blindfolding during tantric foreplay four please yourself first or ask her to please herself first at first glance this may sound like a selfish act completely against tantric sex principles actually its not

3577029 the innovative elements of the game have the potential to appeal to both nintendo enthusiasts and more casual nintendo ds players
3577030 we are excited to bring an indie inspired new intellectual property to the ea casual entertainment label with henry hatsworth that fuses together two styles of gameplay utilizing the two nintendo ds screens like never before
3577031 the innovative elements of the game have the potential to appeal to both nintendo enthusiasts and more casual nintendo ds players
3577032 its a deep challenging and humorous game that you wont want to put down
3577033 its very clear that green energy is now front and center in the minds of the business sector
3577034 not only will you see panels on the roofs of your local stores but i suspect very soon retailers will have stickers in their windows saying this is a green energy store
3577035 we want to keep pushing as many as we possibly can
3577036 its going to be the wal marts of the world that will buy these things over acres and make a difference
3577037 were hoping that our purchases along with some other retailers will help bring the technology costs down
3577038 every project that starts development has to be finished by dec 31 or you lose tax equity advantage and nobodys willing to take that risk

3577040 in germany there are none of the concerns you find in the united states about whether support will be around next year
3577041 would not be in the best interest of the community
3577042 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3577043 what was perceived as a failure is not the school not the parents not the teachers not the students and it is not me
3577044 the bottom line is charter school law was not followed and oversight was not provided
3577045 he did not defraud swindle or steal from that school
3577046 minneapolis played no part in this until now when theyre going to take it away
3577047 this is not an easy decision it ticks me off that one person was able to affect 250 students
3577048 i know students who have been at heart of the earth for years
3577049 we would absolutely move to help those students find schools with help from the american indian community
3577050 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3577051 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3577052 you dont think that ccwf would release you in order to bring you back for a big splash do you
3577053 what are you still doing here you should be gone by now
3577054 a day before i was supposed to go they told me i had another month
3577055 ive got another year on my sentence and a parole hold
3577056 oh yeah thats a mistake shes going out to court
3577057 let me be perfectly clear you forgot the bank robbery
3577058 axis of evil members however immediately dismissed the new axis as
3577059 everybody knows were the best evils best at being evil were the best
3577060 diplomats from syria denied they were jealous over being excluded although
3577061 this is not my rule its tradition in world war ii you had germany italy and japan in the evil axis so you can only have three and a secret handshake ours is wickedly cool
3577062 international reaction to bushs axis of evil declaration was swift as
3577063 axis of not so much evil really as just generally disagreeable
3577064 with the criteria suddenly expanded and all the desirable clubs filling up
3577065 axis of countries that arent the worst but certainly wont be asked to host the olympics
3577066 thats not a threat really just something we like to do
3577067 while wondering if the other nations of the world werent perhaps making
3577068 israel meanwhile insisted it didnt want to join any axis but privately
3577069 write your name date class and then place your pencil down
3577070 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3577071 is vulnerable to adversaries who seek information about our nations homeland defense programs classified or unclassified
3577072 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
3577073 must have told the relievers that they need to throw strikes
3577074 it was absolutely stuff that sounded like it was out of a movie and the veteran lived it
3577075 its a totally eye opening experience in learning what they do for our country in ways i didnt even know
3577076 capturing their stories is imperative to know what is going on in our country and our world
3577077 i dont really think it matters what your beliefs are on the war or what your beliefs are politically
3577078 these people are still serving our country and they still did something valuable and i think its important for everyone to realize that
3577079 do i regret it no i have two wonderful children who are also my best friends and two beautiful grandchildren of course it would have been much easier if we could have been married
3577080 was it a wise thing to do probably not but you dont choose who you fall in love with sometimes it just happens
3577081 do i regret it no i have two wonderful children who are also my best friends and two beautiful grandchildren of course it would have been much easier if we could have been married
3577082 jim came for part of christmas eve but had to go home my mother was with us and stayed the night then my brother picked her up in the morning to go to his house
3577083 it was the first year my family was not together for christmas my dad had remarried and was with his new wife and their daughter
3577084 that was probably the most difficult day i ever had other than the two times jim was in the hospital and i had to learn about it indirectly
3577085 no one was ever unkind to them at least not that i heard about
3577086 sure there were lonely times for me but jim was there when we needed him
3577087 i saw him every day and he adored the kids and saw them all the time everything was not always wonderful there were frustrations life was not a bowl of cherries but we sat them down and told them from the beginning that they were loved and wanted
3577088 my dad instilled in me that if you were a have its your duty your responsibility to make the world a better place for the have nots in your community nationally internationally i learned that from my father and it is something i have always believed
3577089 we were some of the earliest protestors we would stand outside the old federal building with signs people would throw eggs and rotten tomatoes at us
3577090 i was one of six people at my caucus and the others all knew each other
3577091 once you disclose youre a legal secretary people always want you to be a district secretary or convention secretary
3577092 we were physically drained by all of the doorknocking events phoning mailing we were brokenhearted by joans defeat some of us just couldnt continue others needed a break to leave politics for a little while other board members elected to stay on out of 22 of us eight or 10 of us kept the caucus going
3577093 i had lived in minnetonka for 24 years and she was my first democratic senator
3577094 ive slowed down some i cant door knock like i used to
3577095 it has been an honor a challenge and a lot of fun representing minnesota democrats on the state and national level ive made some wonderful friendships and had some wonderful experiences as im approaching my mid 70s i realize its time for someone else to lead
3577096 i think this has been the hardest political year for me
3577097 it was very hard for me and for many others when hillary withdrew
3577098 it was very depressing for me in the sense that i had thought that this country and its citizens had moved past considering women third class citizens
3577099 white males are first class minority males are second class and women are third class thats what hillarys loss and the way she was treated means
3577100 im hurt and very disappointed its almost like all of these years putting so much time and energy campaigning to help individuals have a better life have i accomplished anything
3577101 she said shes going to come to our plant sale next year
3577102 why does my company need to do press releases how will press releases benefit my seo campaign
3577103 what can you do or say to get your ex back
3577104 who do you have to be to attract the people you want to
3577105 ive been there before heard it all before done it all before and it never works for me
3577106 in my 25 years in business my people have always been my most important asset
3577107 hey mariam how do you know the difference between the egg with yolk and the egg with a chick
3577108 i think they know it when they shake the egg theres an egg that have a chick and another that have yolk
3577109 so is it the same egg that the same chicken lay or different kind of eggs
3577110 i think the chicken lays different kind of eggs or what else
3577111 they have been attacking georgia from a cyber standpoint since july
3577112 our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days
3577113 the cyber attack was taking down every georgian government website
3577114 it is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any conclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers
3577115 these types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following any conflict or political tension
3577116 this actually looks more like grass roots hacktivist types people that jumped on the bandwagon
3577117 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3577118 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3577119 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3577120 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3577121 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3577122 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3577123 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3577124 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3577125 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3577126 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3577127 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3577128 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3577129 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3577130 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3577131 bebaskan kempen daripada rasuah undi caci maki tuduh menuduh tanpa bukti penggunaan bahasa atau isyarat yang kasar dan kesat
3577132 proses demokrasi jika tidak dipandu dengan kesedaran islam akan menjerumuskan kita ke kancah yang serba jijik dan kotor
3577133 lihatlah apa yang terjadi dalam masyarakat kita apabila berpegang dengan demokrasi yang tidak ditapis dengan tapisan wahyu ilahi lahirnya politik wang permusuhan sesama muslim tanpa alasan yang benar fitnah mengfitnah caci mencaci dan segala macam racun permusuhan dan kebencian yang hidup atas nama baja demokrasi
3577134 maka saya yang teramat daif ini mengambil kesempatan mengingatkan para calon dan mereka yang terlibat dalam kempen pilihan raya permatang pauh yang kebetulan juga merupakan kawasan undi saya untuk berpegang dengan prinsip prinsip islam ketika berkempen
3577135 bebaskan kempen anda dari rasuah undi caci maki tuduh menuduh tanpa bukti penggunaan bahasa atau isyarat yang kasar dan kesat membuka aib orang tanpa sebarang keperluan yang diizinkan syarak dan seumpamanya
3577136 kesemua itu adalah dosa walaupun atas nama demokrasi dan kegilaan undi keperluan politik umat bukan itu semua
3577137 sebaliknya kita ingin mendengar siapakah yang memiliki pemikiran dan idea yang mampu membangunkan masyarakat dan negara ke arah yang lebih harmoni terurus dan sopan berdasarkan teras teras yang diredhahi allah
3577138 janganlah nanti generasi baru yang sedang membesar akhirnya tidak mengenali politik melainkan dengan wajah serba kehodohan dan kebiadapan cara dan bahasa
3577139 hak hak setiap muslim lebih mulia di sisi allah daripada kerusi politik yang menjadi kegilaan sebahagian manusia
3577140 kita sudah penat mendengar maki hamun ketidakjujuran pembohongan dan penipuan atas nama politik berilah ruang untuk rakyat hidup dalam udara politik yang bersih dan segar jangan jadikan mereka terbiasa dengan pencemaran sehingga akhirnya mereka sebati dengan kejijikan siasah yang tiada penghujungnya
3577141 saya pun tidak tahu setakat ini saya tidak ada dengar apa apa lagi

3577150 tv creative shown on youtube and embedded in content is as effective as when shown on tv across multiple dimensions likeability and engagement that drives purchase intent
3577151 we connect consumers to all the information they care about
3577152 certainly weve been monitoring it all along and were just waiting for the case to be finalized so mr duncan can be extradited here in riverside county so the victims family here can have their day in court

3577155 were pulling for him ive never said i was disappointed all ive said basically was that wed like to see him start hitting and it created a stir
3577156 to his credit hes continued to hustle and hes played really well in right field hes just in a little bit of a slump probably trying to do too much
3577157 he needs just to do the things that hes capable of like he was earlier in the year hes taking less pitches hes not working the count the way he was earlier he just needs to swing at more strikes
3577158 you try to find somebody else thats swinging the bat
3577159 it created a stir and if thats the case im sorry
3577160 and you know what he probably is but i think we give him one more and then we put him back into the closers role
3577161 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3577162 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3577163 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3577164 hopefully well be able to get down and get on that podium

3577166 analog ntsc will live on with analog cable vhs and composite s video connections in the usa analog ntsc and pal will live on for decades in the rest of world row
3577167 id suggest either 72 fps 3x24p or 96 fps 4x24p as a new world standard there is no reason to obsolete all current equipment unless we are moving to something better
3577168 then why all the rush to interpolated 120hz 100hz pal for home movie display
3577169 live big screen video using hand held cameras would be inadequate at 48p
3577170 creo que todos podemos estar de acuerdo en que como medio los videoclips tuvieron su lugar en los a os 90 y que hoy ese lugar ha sido tomado por internet as son las cosas y creo que cualquiera que lo refute en el 2008 es un idiota
3577171 safe to assume that the general consensus in congress is to change the constitution
3577172 the results of the survey are interesting but i am not surprised i am concerned about the pronouncements made by the president and if it will have any bearing on our committee hearings
3577173 while we support the moro peoples struggle for self determination we will not allow their legitimate cause to be used as a means for arroyo to inflict far reaching damage on the people and the country by staying in power and removing the remaining protectionist provisions in the constitution
3577174 the basic issue is if we should amend the constitution and the extension of arroyos term is just a peripheral issue
3577175 specific not all the respondents are aware of the proposed amendments to the constitution
3577176 there will always be objections on the part of the people
3577177 i assure you that when i initiated this informal survey i initiated it on my own 100 percent and results came out even before arroyo made the pronouncements
3577178 i can do all things through christ who gives me strength
3577179 you can measure your love for him by the depth and length of your sadness

3577185 its way too hard some of what went on out there with the setup made no sense im a big pga of america guy but this week it was like things happened too fast for them and they lost control of an event where players are historically allowed to play
3577186 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3577187 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3577188 i question whether we can ever really be confrontational with the usga
3577189 for any company now to engage would be a major distraction plus you know that the day you start to be really confrontational with the usga the next 20 rules they put together are going to feel way harsher i question whether we can ever really be confrontational with the usga
3577190 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3577191 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3577192 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3577193 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3577194 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3577195 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3577196 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3577197 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3577198 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3577199 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3577200 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3577201 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3577202 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3577203 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3577204 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3577205 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3577206 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3577207 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3577208 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3577209 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3577210 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3577211 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3577212 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3577213 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3577214 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3577215 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3577216 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
3577217 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3577218 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
3577219 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3577220 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3577221 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3577222 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3577223 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3577224 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3577225 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3577226 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3577227 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3577228 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it

3577230 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3577231 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3577232 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3577233 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3577234 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3577235 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
3577236 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson

3577257 the truly interesting thing about the john edwards love child scandal is not that it happened men are human beings alas but how having been broken by the national enquirer the story percolated for weeks in the online world before exploding friday into what is called with increasing derision the mainstream media why didnt we print it sooner a liberal plot a sign of msm timidity a scandal in itself i cant speak for others but i ignored the story for what strikes me as six solid reasons 1 edwards isnt running for president anymore 2 i dont buy the notion that every private aspect of a candidates life illustrates his potential public actions 3 this newspaper gets accused of being the national enquirer as it is every time we print a shocking story without our also going out of the way to follow its lead 4 i didnt care for edwards before and waving an unpleasant fact about someone you dont like anyway is the way of the zealot 5 im not that much of a hypocrite 6 who really cares even fdr did it
3577258 i looked the man in the eye and he said watch more volleyball
3577259 but here were saying the critical part of what it means to be good to succeed at the very specific and critical task at finding colon cancers has nothing to do with speed of facility on the contrary it depends on those who are willing to take their time and willing to very very painstakingly go through something that seems like it can be done in a minute in other words thats a mismatch we select on a cognitive grounds for people being fast at things but what we really want is a personality characteristic that allows people to be slow at critical things here we have the same thing with wiles in a certain sense we have erected in our society a system that selects people for tasks like solving fermats or tackling big modern problems on the basis of their intelligence and the smarter they seem to be the more we push them forward but what were saying with wiles is that the critical issue here was not his intellectual brilliance it was his stubbornness it was the notion that he was willing to put everything else aside and spend 10 000 hours on a problem no one else thought could be solved so this is the question are we actually selecting people for stubbornness i dont think we are

3577269 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3577270 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3577271 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation

3577366 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3577367 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3577368 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3577369 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3577370 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3577371 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3577372 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3577383 era una cuesti n de inter s nacional la ni a ten a que aparecer ante las c maras deb a ser expresiva
3577384 lin miaoke es excelente para todo eso pero en cuanto a la voz yang peiyi es perfecta todo el equipo estaba de acuerdo
3577385 nos dijeron que hab a un problema y que hab a que resolverlo lo resolvimos
3577386 es insultar a la verdadera cantante y a la gente que le escuch
3577387 puede que se utilizaran im genes de pies grabadas con anterioridad debido a la mala visibilidad
3577388 se hace todo por la imagen de china sin el menor respeto por el p blico
3577389 no creo que el gobierno chino se d cuenta hasta qu punto esto no es tico ni siquiera entiende los valores que veh cula en estos casos
3577390 soy un caballero y creo que las causas de ciertos conflictos familiares deben quedar bajo siete llaves s es cierto nos estamos separando pero no voy a dar m s detalles al respecto
3577391 enviar un comunicado de prensa y ese tema quedar ah porque no voy a hablar nunca m s del asunto que es muy delicado sobre todo porque hay ni os de por medio
3577392 when you are trying to sell a five or six figure product sight unseen to a customer living in australia technology is the only means for communication negotiation and building trust
3577393 without embracing it our business would still be struggling to grow outside our region of the country much less internationally
3577394 our electronic fully rendered images are so detailed they can even include human figures allowing customers to truly visualize the product no matter how far away they are
3577395 this along with the option to personally update their floor plan as if they were physically present at the build site puts customers minds at ease and really sets us apart
3577396 it gives me enormous pleasure to bring the boys are back to shoot in south australia
3577397 im looking forward to showing the splendour of the fleurieu to the wider world
3577398 this is a big film by local standards but we have wonderful crew we have wonderful cast and all sorts of opportunities to exploit here in terms of locations
3577399 ive always loved filming here and ive always looked for opportunities to do it and at last that has happened
3577400 this investment will assist to reach our target to increase production in sa to six feature films per year by 2014
3577401 this will help south australia s brand as the home of independent filmmaking
3577402 im pleased with my time even though a couple of technical things went wrong
3577403 going for air and getting a mouthful of water instead that puts a damper on doing well it was the second breath out of the turn its happened to me before you just learn not to panic that a breath is coming in two more strokes
3577404 were obviously better than weve been and we sat out our two best swimmers
3577405 we all did our job we just need a lane for the final
3577406 loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul
3577407 this man wishes to be accorded the same privilege as a sponge he wishes to think
3577408 i become fearful when i see people substituting fear for reason
3577409 i want you to grab life by its little bunny ears and get in its face
3577410 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
3577411 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
3577412 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
3577413 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny
3577414 she does a lot of trekking herself but she was very excited about it
3577415 we did say it was going to be a life changing experience and it certainly has been that
3577416 we are better at seeing patterns and abstracting the meaning of an event than we are at recording detail
3577417 the more attention the brain pays to a given stimulus the more elaborately the information will be encoded and retained
3577418 emotionally charged events persist much longer in our memories and are recalled with greater accuracy than neutral memories the brain remembers the emotional components of an experience better than any other aspect studies show that emotional arousal focuses attention on the gist of an experience at the expense of peripheral details
3577419 we are better at seeing patterns and abstracting the meaning of an event than we are at recording detail
3577420 start with the key ideas and in a hierarchical fashion form the details around these larger notions
3577421 the most common communication mistakes relating too much information with not enough time devoted to connecting the dots lots of force feeding very little digestion
3577422 the brain naturally focuses on concepts sequentially one at a time
3577423 retina is not passive specialized nerve cells deep within the retina interpret the patterns of photons assemble the patterns into partial movie tracks
3577424 we actually experience our visual environment as a fully analyzed opinion about what the brain thinks is out there
3577425 the more visual the input becomes the more likely it is to be recognized and recalled
3577426 one of the reasons that text is less capable than pictures is that the brain sees words as lots of tiny pictures
3577427 we have to identify certain features in the letters to be able to read them
3577428 those in multisensory environments always do better than those in uni sensory environments they have more recall with better resolution that lasts longer evident even 20 years later
3577429 perception is not where the integration begins but where the integration culminates
3577430 multisensory inputs speed up responses increase accuracy improve stimulation detection and enrich encoding at the moment of learning
3577431 three things matter in determining whether a workplace is stressful the type of stress a balance between occupational stimulation and boredom and the condition of the employees home life
3577432 controls functions involve four fs fighting feeling fleeting and reproductive behavior
3577433 one of the most active well connected parts of brain
3577434 each region of the cortex was highly specialized with sections for speech for vision for memory
3577435 by the time children are 3 years old the connections in specific regions of their brains have doubled or even tripled this has given rise to the popular belief that infant brain development is the critical key to intellectual success in life thats not true
3577436 what you do and learn in life physically changes what your brain looks like it literally rewires it
3577437 the physical changes result in the functional organization and reorganization of the brain
3577438 no two peoples brains store the same information in the same way in the same place
3577439 are established very early in life and they remain stable throughout life
3577440 the neurological differences can at least in the case of language predict performance
3577441 designed to solve problems related to surviving in an unstable outdoor environment and to do so in nearly constant motion
3577442 the adult brain throughout life retains the ability to change its structure and function in response to experience
3577443 our survival did not depend upon exposing ourselves to organized pre planned packets of information
3577444 so how much toilet paper do you guys use when you take a shit is there a certain amount of sheets youre supposed to use
3577445 when i wipe my ass i reach for the toilet paper with my opposite hand and i pull it across my body within an arms length however many squares that is thats how much i use
3577446 when i go to use toilet paper i let the roll unwrap until the first sheet touches the floor thats how i know how many squares of toilet paper to use
3577447 have you ever tried psychoactive drugs why or why not
3577448 bao i dont know why they called me but you might want to check it out
3577449 well we got everything locked up pretty good so im sure its okay
3577450 well we have stacks and stacks of these white trays on our side im assuming they belong to you guys but im not sure what you use them for
3577451 son dont be sad karma will take its toll i came to america with nothing but the clothes on my back and the dirt on my hands everything we have your mother and i worked for from the ground on up its not like we cant do it again
3577452 exercise also regulates the release of the three neurotransmitters most commonly associated with the maintenance of mental health serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine
3577453 the ability to make insulin and to extract energy from glucose begins to fail miserably and you find a marked need to have more of it because the bodys stress hormone levels begin to rise in an increasingly deregulated fashion
3577454 people into depression which is a deregulation of thought processes including memory language quantitative reasoning fluid intelligence and spatial perception
3577455 if you spend a considerable amount of time reading about subjects that have nothing to do with your life but provide you with great satisfaction try to incorporate these interests into your life or work in some way
3577456 the most creative project that we can undertake is the design of our lives so i set to work to redesign mine in such a way that my curiosity could manifest itself in my career it was sort of an adaptive or re use project
3577457 deciding what you want to gain from it and by being comfortable with your ignorance
3577458 time fast and slow if you studied all the things that take place in a minute or a day or a week or a year or a thousand years you would have a new framework for understanding and for cataloging information
3577459 the five minute circle what could you do or see in five minutes from where you are sitting
3577460 the five mile circle what could you do see and understand about sociology the fabric of schools urban life and systems within five miles of where you are sitting
3577461 this is your new world if you were king of this five mile world how would you run it change it understand it and communicate with it
3577462 how to explain something so your mother could understand it
3577463 we assume that others can understand the same things we can
3577464 the obvious and how to hug it in our zeal to appear educated not only do we often forget the obvious we avoid it yet it is in the realm of the obvious that most solutions lie
3577465 they have been attacking georgia from a cyber standpoint since july
3577466 our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days
3577467 the cyber attack was taking down every georgian government website
3577468 it is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any conclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers
3577469 these types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following any conflict or political tension
3577470 this actually looks more like grass roots hacktivist types people that jumped on the bandwagon
3577471 the second quarter was one of the strongest trade contributions to the ever
3577472 the gdp itself looks to be 3 2 which means that without trade we would be flat
3577473 if the tree falls in the woods would it make a sound
3577474 the group decision making process as needing to fulfill four task requirements 1 problem analysis 2 goal setting 3 identification of alternatives and 4 evaluation of positive and negative consequences if members are to reach a high quality solution
3577475 actions of persons in conversation are reflectively reproduced as the interaction continues
3577476 is this what you want to be doing is this what you wanted with your life find your dream job here
3577477 this is how the sculpture at the square looked like

3577490 how can i live and work to match thy goodness
3577491 do it right do it big do it with style
3577492 many churches feel that when something needs to be done they must hire someone to do it
3577493 we are to love them minister to them and witness to them of his love
3577494 but once they begin serving they fall in love with the people themselves and this motivates further service
3577495 koinonia is a deep sense of belonging to one another
3577496 if gods people are to witness and minis ter to a lost and hurting world
3577497 koi nonia must be the sustaining context in which they find their strength and will to do so
3577498 jesus was concerned for whole persons body mind and spirit
3577499 what ever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
3577500 gave rise to churches that practiced social ministries without addressing the spiritual need for forgiveness of sin and recon ciliation with god
3577501 the social gospel divorced from per sonal salvation is like a body without a soul the message of personal salvation without a social dimension is like a soul without a body the former is a corpse the latter is a ghost
3577502 since then i never felt i was worthy of any bodys love
3577503 before i came to this ministry i felt i was not worthy even of my own mothers love but now i feel worthy of gods love and that makes me able to love others for the first time

3577509 the age of all of them was no less than 80
3577510 this is a deserted place and it is already late dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves
3577511 there is no need for them to go away give them some food yourselves
3577512 five loaves and two fish are all we have here
3577513 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3577514 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3577515 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3577516 i think many who dont come from an evangelical context may miss the point it is a professionally cut edited and produced ad full of sinister dog whistles for evangelical ears at best it is suggesting supporters of obama are idol worshipers at its worst it is suggesting that sen obama is some kind of anti christ
3577517 the premise is that the campaign would release the name of the vp nominee one hour in advance to 100 supporters selected at random from those who signed up for mccain e mail list as a result of this campaign
3577518 even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime
3577519 there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening
3577520 the question is not whether english will change but how it will change
3577521 baghdad looks so beautiful from the sky the twists and turns of the tigris the bridges and inter twining highways engineered to perfection make this city so special
3577522 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3577523 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3577524 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3577525 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3577526 we are going to be doing more budget cutting more budget restructuring more efficiencies
3577527 we have only just begun that process with jails and school administrative districts more needs to be done and we are going to do more of that and reduce the income tax on earned income
3577528 this finding opens promising new avenues for the treatment of alcoholism
3577529 insulin is already known to act in the nervous system to regulate food intake so it makes sense that it would influence the response to other substances the body senses as rewards such as alcohol or drugs of abuse
3577530 in animals and humans dopamine in the brain affects the response to both food and drugs we are starting to see that in addition to its importance in sugar metabolism insulin regulates release of neurotransmitters and may be crucial in determining the response to addictive drugs

3577544 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3577545 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3577546 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3577547 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic

3577554 this is something major for the streets a lot of people who didnt or who dont normally get love from other outlets can count on ozone to shed some light on them
3577555 after all these years the only award ive ever received was a ozone award
3577556 so i love the show its the third year it keeps getting better
3577557 the internet community has become very polarized either you liked this book or you hated this book we took a stance that if you liked the book were going to be a place for discussion about that
3577558 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3577559 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3577560 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3577561 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3577562 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3577563 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3577564 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years
3577565 for those who were disappointed go be passionate about something else
3577566 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3577567 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3577568 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right
3577569 for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression

3577591 the president of tiny georgia must have caught a case of his pal bushs war lust to attack a russian ally and think hed win
3577592 the question is whether president george w bush and vice president dick cheney are encouraging georgian president mikheil saakashvili to force the next us president to back the north atlantic treaty organization nato military agenda of the current bush administration
3577593 washington may have badly misjudged the possibilities as it did in iraq and there are even possible nuclear consequences
3577594 killed 13 russian soldiers and injured 150 and took over 2 000 civilian lives mostly russian citizens
3577595 without america there would be no war in ossetia and no war between russia and its former constituent part
3577596 at this point the georgian attack on south ossetia appears to have been a terrible miscalculation by the georgians and their us and israeli advisors who have been trying to solidify control over the oil pipeline in recent months
3577597 theres even some reason to believe that the foreign advisors may have been in the forefront of the attack
3577598 when he said no she apologized and assured him that she would find him later
3577599 russian authorities make no secret of their desire to see mr saakashvili tried for war crimes in the hague
3577600 the business employment dynamics bed data series include gross job gains and gross job losses at the establishment level by major industry sector and for the 50 states as well as gross job gains and gross job losses at the firm level by employer size class gross job gains are the sum of increases in employment from expansions at existing units and the addition of new jobs at opening units gross job losses are the result of contractions in employment at existing units and the loss of jobs at closing units the difference between the number of gross jobs gained and the number of gross jobs lost is the net change in employment
3577601 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3577602 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3577603 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3577604 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together
3577605 i wouldnt know about it we are facilitating discussions among three parties

3577611 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3577612 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
3577613 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
3577614 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
3577615 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
3577616 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
3577617 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage

3577620 while the purported failure to report the gifts does not directly involve earmarking the allegations are related to the abuse of a member of congresss position in order to do favors for a donor whether it is an earmark or a contract it all stems from providing a benefit paid for by taxpayers in exchange for some form of support

3577641 a legitimate policy choice by the congress that passed erisa to maintain one consistent federal policy and body of law for purposes of employee benefits
3577642 we have to recognize that our prior attempt to construe the phrase relate to does not give us much help drawing the line here
3577643 the supreme court flunks trusts 1990 s ct rev 207 1990
3577644 s uch limited discovery would not itself be unduly burdensome
3577645 the need for efficiency and economy in erisa cases generally dictates that no discovery be permitted until a showing of need has been made
3577646 has repeatedly denied benefits to deserving participants by interpreting plan terms incorrectly or by making decisions against the weight of evidence in the record
3577647 should prove more important perhaps of great importance where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision including but not limited to cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration
3577648 are no talismanic words that can avoid the process of judgment
3577649 mental health diagnoses for serious problems independent from substance abuse are proportionately higher in appalachia than in the rest of the nation
3577650 a major impediment to economic growth in the appalachian region
3577651 it found relatively lower marijuana and cocaine use in appalachia and lower treatment admission rates for heroin it also found that while there might be hot spots of methamphetamine abuse use of the drug was lower overall in appalachia than in the united states
3577652 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
3577653 i got my shotgun and i made my way out of the bedroom
3577654 as i raised my weapon he raised his and i shot
3577655 he tried to run out the front door and i shot and hit him again
3577656 but taking over the offense that happens later right now im just trying to get into the groove get everything clicking and get everyone on the same page
3577657 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition
3577658 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
3577659 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
3577660 it has all the makings of a real good line
3577661 were all trying to get the chemistry this camp so we can work well heading into the season
3577662 somewhere along the line out of those seven or eight guys weve got to get four guys who can start and others who can come in and play
3577663 were going to try to do what we did two years ago with dan wagner brendan st peter and marvin wright inside and on the outside trying to get three of them in a rotation
3577664 the opener is definitely going to fly by and be here before we know it
3577665 but the key is you cant look ahead 3 weeks youve got to focus on getting better and better day by day
3577666 cash and i have been glued to the olympics how amazing was the opening ceremony i still dont know how they co ordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync
3577667 the mens 400m relay was insane we were down by almost a half body length going into the final turn and then next thing you knew it was closer closer closer until we touched the wall first cash and i went crazy
3577668 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3577669 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3577670 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3577671 i have nothing to hide theres no sex tape with me and some guy doing anything lewd so im not even worried about that
3577672 im only worried about my family who is most important in all of this my parents raised me well and i would never shame them like that or make a video like that
3577673 ive never even been intimate with anyone to be quite honest believe me i havent even gotten to that stage yet
3577674 ive never posed naked or topless in any photo im sure there are some pictures of me in a bikini on vacation but thats about it
3577675 its a lot faster im still getting used to college football and everything that comes with it
3577676 im looking forward to traveling with the team since i didnt get to last year
3577677 this offseason i was along with 60 other guys up here and its different it was a good bonding experience with the team and we got a lot of work done
3577678 hes got a lot of potential and hes very athletic
3577679 i think he will be competing for his position he has some good people in front of him right now but hell put up a good fight if i know rod hell put up a very good fight
3577680 a lot of time for young guys in our program the key for them is special teams
3577681 its for those guys to earn the trust of the coaches and get their feet wet a little bit special teams is walkers route right now to find his way on the field
3577682 we are trying to find the best 11 on defense and the best 11 on offense so if walker finds himself there he will absolutely start there is no preconceived notion on where guys will end up as we go through things
3577683 i mean they are welcome to watch and find out but im not even sure what that is yet
3577684 roddy stayed here this summer and worked very very hard on what he was doing
3577685 hes in great shape but it only goes to how far he wants it to go if he works hard theres not a question about it
3577686 its a big difference from portsmouth high school but footballs football
3577687 the one thing about rod is hes trying to be like a sponge and soak this all up now hes got to figure out how to put it all into place
3577688 i enjoy doing things like drawing pencil mostly reading hanging out with friends shopping watching and playing sports feel free to send something my way
3577689 jurisdiction may not be sustained as a theory that the plaintiff has not advanced
3577690 plaintiff admits that the overpayments were made but argues that defendants claim is subject to exhaustion although there is little support for plaintiffs argument
3577691 money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendants possession
3577692 restitution by pension and welfare funds is governed by federal common law in the shadow of erisa
3577693 funds need not be traceable in the event of a lien by agreement
3577694 a judge of moderate leanings a self described pragmatist interested more in solutions than in theories

3577698 a civil action may be brought by the secretary of labor or by a participant beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section 1109 of this title
3577699 promises the participant the value of an individual account at retirement
3577700 the value of her account unencumbered by any fiduciary impropriety
3577701 whatever is in the retirement account when the employee retires or whatever would have been there had the plan honored the employees entitlement which includes an entitlement to prudent management
3577702 congress intended the federal courts to construe erisas jurisdictional requirements broadly in order to facilitate enforcement of its remedial provisions
3577703 authorize s recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participants individual account
3577704 we think this case calls into question the tax exempt status of a number of tax exempt organizations its not just vsp at risk here its other hospitals other health maintenance organizations nursing homes clinics theres a lot of confusion out there
3577705 an organization is operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare if it is primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good and general welfare of the people of the community
3577706 i quit growing too young to ever think about getting to have a shot at playing in college so this is about as much fun i can have
3577707 the press thinks were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori
3577708 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid
3577709 her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3577710 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3577711 they didnt even get the numbers right so i dont know if its about the money either
3577712 i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you who are genuinely concerned about reginae and her safety
3577713 please allow me to dispel any rumors or speculations and report that my daughter is alive healthy and surrounded by family who care and love her dearly
3577714 the rumors are completely false and unfounded neither reginae nor any other member of my family has been involved in any car accident
3577715 i know and love the velvet revolver guys but there is no truth to the story about me joining their band
3577716 it was the perfect time to do this and they dont have to pay for advertising and promotion and they need that
3577717 he came and shook my hand and i guess he was mad cause i called myself the president
3577718 then someone else jumped in and tried to hit me in my nose but i still got up there on the ozone awards and performed
3577719 its gonna get handled in the streets i came to the ozone awards for my song cutty buddy and he came from behind my back like a coward its sad we have to talk about this
3577720 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3577721 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3577722 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3577723 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3577724 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3577725 it is our objective to get this company to profitability in 2008 although our revenues increased and we continue to be awarded new business and build backlog we have not generated the financial results that we were anticipating to achieve as a result we are taking corrective actions immediately to address the losses we have incurred the actions we are taking should result in an initial annual cost savings of more than 4 million the moves are across the board including reductions in the salaries of senior management while difficult to make these actions should reduce our fixed cost structure going forward during the second quarter of 2008 we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill and other long lived intangible assets for impairment utilizing a third party we determined that the carrying value was in excess of fair value resulting in an impairment charge of approximately 1 2 million
3577726 the industry in which we operate remains vibrant and our customer satisfaction level remains very high the re alignment of our cost structure should not affect our go to market strategy or our ability to respond to our customer requirements the ramp up of higher margin facilities management business has taken longer than we hoped so these latest moves position us to operate more effectively with our existing backlog of business
3577727 hackers also competed in making spy balloons that floated above the casinos
3577728 really i was there and im pretty sure someone made a balloon carrying a passive wifi scanner and scanned the strip for 400 wifi networks spy balloons come on
3577729 these reforms will help more aboriginal people plan deliver and evaluate health programs and services with the goal of improving the health and well being our first nations people in nova scotia
3577730 we work collaboratively on many areas of health and submit on a regular basis joint proposals with regard to health benefits for our communities in cape breton
3577731 right now there are no indicators within provincial health databases that identify first nations people so we have developed in cape breton a registry to allow us to extract information around the health status of our population from the provincial databases
3577732 put an end to the commercialisation of medical practice in singapore
3577733 confirmed a long known sentiment among ordinary singaporeans that health care costs here are simply too high for the average family to cope with
3577734 nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed they are armed because they mistrust each other
3577735 the financing which was carried out at the prevailing market price for discovery metals shares provides a solid financial platform for the company as it progresses with its bankable feasibility study on the boseto copper project in north west botswana
3577736 this is an excellent result for the company and i am extremely pleased with the continued support of the company from a number of existing major shareholders in botswana and australia
3577737 the funds raised will enable the company to rapidly progress the bankable feasibility study on the boseto copper project it is our plan to bring the project into production as soon as possible
3577738 my little heart stopped when he went to the stage but my daughter said you know i think theyre reversing it tonight
3577739 i wasnt nervous before the show but its just that competitive gene you know like at a hockey game
3577740 its just so heart warming and humbling to see the support hes getting from the island and even from the mainland
3577741 hes definitely got everybody on the island talking about it
3577742 i know how much everyones voting for him and in my opinion he had the best performance monday night
3577743 we were a little nervous there when they called him down to the stage
3577744 i figured mitch would go on for at least another week he did an awesome job monday night it was good im pleased for mitch
3577745 way to go mitch one question how come farley had never heard the song before wheres he been living under a rock that tune is massive in port hood
3577746 you know the worlds changed when your order rates drop 50 per cent and prices on various raw materials are raised 20 50 per cent in the space of a couple of months
3577747 this quick response was possible as a result of our more flexible platform after the acquisition of stora enso north america
3577748 our intention is to match production to customer needs which could lead to additional market related downtime if required
3577749 lifes most urgent question is what are you doing for others
3577750 the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter
3577751 and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop graphics processor unit business we have a great product line up and having taken the necessary pricing actions we are strongly positioned again
3577752 we question how a company that creates funds and administers a plan for its own employees benefit can from those facts alone be presumed to have a financial conflict in administering that plan when the company remains free to end the plan altogether
3577753 necessary or desirable for courts to create special burden of proof rules or other special procedural or evidentiary rules focused narrowly upon the evaluator payor conflict
3577754 inconsistent with the language of erisa or the policies that inform the statute and animate the common law of the statute
3577755 this contract shall be governed by the laws of the state in which it is delivered policy delivered in in
3577756 numerous issues which would otherwise be decided by state law are preempted by erisa for the specific purpose of providing uniformity
3577757 i t is not the label placed on a state law claim that determines whether it is preempted but whether in essence such a claim is for the recovery of an erisa plan benefit
3577758 to proceed as a breach of fiduciary duty action would encourage parties to avoid the implications of section 502 a 1 b by artful pleading indeed every wrongful denial of benefits could be characterized as a breach of fiduciary duty
3577759 in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan
3577760 do your own thinking independently be the chess player not the chess piece
3577761 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now

3577764 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
3577765 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3577766 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3577767 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3577768 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3577769 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3577770 turoczy yeah i felt kind of stalker esque revealing it though

3577778 the mystery of aafia siddiquis whereabouts adds another twist to the bizarre tale of her trans formation into a terror suspect while her fellow students at mit read newspaper articles about the massacre of muslims in bosnia in the 1990s aafia siddiqui sprang to action giving slide shows and rousing speeches to collect donations for their cause while other women from traditional pakistani families stayed home after marriage siddiqui juggled the demands of motherhood a doctoral dissertation at brandeis and a roxbury based nonprofit organization she established to spread islamic teachings but yesterday federal prosecutors in new york alleged that siddiquis activism had become extremism us officials say that the 36 year old mother of three became an al qaeda operative who ended up in afghanistan and attacked us soldiers who had come to interrogate her
3577779 okay so does everyone else do this weird thing too
3577780 when most people think of national forests visions of trees and wildlife come to mind but national forests have become a hotbed of narcotics trafficking large expanses of the northern california wilderness typically used for camping and fishing have been replaced by manicured rows consisting of tens of thousands of marijuana plants
3577781 our aim was to find a player that could make a difference and dictate the tempo of our team
3577782 in the end we managed to bring dan dickau to avellino he is a serious professional with nba experience we have nothing to envy of any other playmaker that arrived in italy this year
3577783 bitter cold and floating sea ice long frustrated scientists seeking to study the ocean around antarctica in winter the solution send in the seals the polar regions are expected to be especially sensitive to climate change but collecting data has been a problem especially in the wind whipped southern ocean surrounding antarctica so researchers decided to recruit help from residents of the area they glued electronic data collecting equipment to 58 elephant seals that lived in the region the animals can dive more than a mile deep in search of food the machines radioed back information on temperature pressure salinity and position whenever the seals surfaced
3577784 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3577785 across central washingtons fruit bowl farmers are buying vineyards hoping to establish roots in the area and capitalize on the booming wine industry authorities believe some of the buyers are living in mexico and their vineyards are producing tens of thousands of illegal marijuana plants a crop that could easily surpass grapes in value this year law enforcement officials in the yakima valley already have converged on seven vineyards that had been converted to marijuana operations this summer at least five had been recently purchased the buyers are still being tracked and one had been leased to pot growers by an unknowing owner
3577786 sua vis o se tornar clara somente quando voc olhar para dentro do seu cora o quem olha para fora sonha quem olha para dentro acorda
3577787 if you just knew how much i miss you and how hard this is going to be
3577788 worked with these people on several deals and they are to be avoided unless you are desperate
3577789 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3577790 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3577791 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3577792 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3577793 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3577794 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3577795 i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul
3577796 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3577797 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3577798 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3577799 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3577800 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3577801 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation

3577803 yo chequeo las gasolineras cuando voy en el carro y esta es la que encuentro m s barata
3577804 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3577805 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3577806 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3577807 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3577808 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3577809 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3577810 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3577811 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3577812 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3577813 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3577814 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3577815 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3577816 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3577817 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3577818 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3577819 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3577820 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3577821 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3577822 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3577823 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3577824 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3577825 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3577826 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3577827 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3577828 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3577829 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3577830 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3577831 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3577832 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3577833 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3577834 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3577835 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers
3577836 we have been implementing strict measures to prevent the scalping of tickets
3577837 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3577838 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used
3577839 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3577840 hace unas tres semanas el precio estaba en 1 29 y hace dos no vendemos disel
3577841 en promedio seg n el monitoreo que hicimos el lunes estaba en 95 centavos con las bajas que se reportaron el consumidor no debe de estar pagando m s de 95 centavos
3577842 pero si se sostienen los precios que hemos estado viendo ltimamente bajar a a 92 93 para la semana que viene
3577843 nosotros no le echamos petr leo a los carros sino gasolina que hay que refinar por eso no vas a ver una relaci n directa porque hay una serie de costos que influyen en la estructura de la gasolina que no necesariamente tiene que ver con el costo del petr leo
3577844 hay que entender que las altas y bajas se reflejan con cierto rezago
3577845 si el inventario que recibieron los mayoristas es m s barato que el que ya tienen en tanque van a continuar con el precio existente el m s alto
3577846 the corvid family which are crows blue jays and ravens seem to be most susceptible to the west nile virus
3577847 wisconsin last week confirmed its first human case down in dodge county
3577848 you can avoid the high mosquito times of the day which are dawn and dusk and make sure your screens are intact
3577849 its a virus so there is no treatment for the virus itself but they can treat the symptoms
3577850 we knew better how to prepare having the bus instead of using hotels helped quite a bit
3577851 when i got that flat i felt so close yet so far away
3577852 weve made money for calm for the past two years our riders and crew have been affiliated with calm
3577853 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3577854 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3577855 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3577856 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3577857 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3577858 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3577859 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3577860 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3577861 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3577862 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3577863 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3577864 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3577865 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3577866 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3577867 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3577868 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3577869 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3577870 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3577871 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3577872 he did not die because he left a legacy of poetry behind him he is immortal in our hearts
3577873 technology has changed so dramatically that we can change how we actually operate
3577874 a lot of what we were doing is if you will an old fashioned approach to newsgathering
3577875 what makes the difference is how were able to get out spread those journalists to more places and how quickly we can bring back original reporting to our viewers
3577876 technology has changed so dramatically that we can change how we actually operate
3577877 a lot of what we were doing is if you will an old fashioned approach to newsgathering
3577878 what makes the difference is how were able to get out spread those journalists to more places and how quickly we can bring back original reporting to our viewers
3577879 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3577880 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3577881 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3577882 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3577883 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3577884 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3577885 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3577886 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3577887 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3577888 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3577889 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3577890 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3577891 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3577892 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3577893 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3577894 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3577895 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3577896 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3577897 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3577898 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3577899 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3577900 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3577901 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3577902 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3577903 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3577904 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3577905 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3577906 it was hard for us to say we were experts in this niche without a portfolio of finished projects
3577907 i was impressed to find everything so well laid out
3577908 my search time was cut in half compared to other cities i was scouting
3577909 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3577910 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3577911 integrity is an interactive marketing agency integrity is a way of doing business we bring new ideas and techniques to traditional marketing challenges we collaborate with large organizations to identify their opportunities for growth and architect communication strategies that hit the mark we are passionate strategists creatives and technologists armed with fresh perspectives on the fundamentals of multi channel marketing

3577913 weighted too heavily to preserve trees to the detriment of property rights schneider said
3577914 we want to say to land owners and developers that you need to do your best effort in layout and design and sensitivity so the end result is good for everybody schneider said
3577915 material probative evidence demonstrating that 1 a palpable conflict of interest or a serious procedural irregularity existed which 2 caused a serious breach of the plan administrators fiduciary duty
3577916 a conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion
3577917 when making a benefit determination under the policy unum has discretionary authority to determine your eligibility for benefits and to interpret the terms and provisions of the policy

3577925 asserting itself as a regional problem solver and power broker
3577926 the idea is youre all getting in on the bottom rung of the ladder
3577927 were right at the beginning of the process so you get an opportunity to weigh in before weve really made any decisions at all
3577928 we understand budget cuts and we understand the levels of resources that we are being provided
3577929 im just asking that if cuts do need to be made theyre equitable and fair across the board
3577930 here is one of those situations where a penny saved is not a penny earned a penny spent is a dollar saved
3577931 i wont eliminate them from my budget but i cant guarantee there wont be some money eliminated
3577932 tidak bisa diterima di abad ke 21 dan bahwa moskow bersalah atas

3577934 facebook is a tremendous organization and i would not leave it if it were not for a great opportunity
3577935 corn and beans were planted on grasslands and fallow fields barns and silos were lost and there was an increase in pesticide use to control rodents and other agricultural pests
3577936 theyre subject to predation by great horned owls and their own food source is very cyclical rodents can be very plentiful one year and very sparse the next
3577937 so the barn owl population can be good one year and crash the next but theyre very prolific breeders so their numbers can rebound quickly
3577938 how could he be looking at a motorcyle when he has a wife and 3 kids
3577939 im convinced being generous is a better way to live im convinced forgiving people and not carrying around bitterness is a better way to live im convinced having compassion is a better way to live im convinced pursuing peace in every situation is a better way to live im convinced listening to the wisdom of others is a better way to live im convinced being honest with people is a better way to live this way of thinking isnt weird or strange it is simply acknowledging that everybody follows somebody and im trying to follow jesus
3577940 we really want to have someone here who can speak that language who can really relate to that community
3577941 i would like a handful but one would be a great start
3577942 with the shops and the restaurants it gives a little bounce
3577943 if youre a victim of a crime your immigration status is not going to come into play
3577944 we are trying to overcome this lack of trust because it hurts the people
3577945 he or she will be the best advertisement and there will quickly be more
3577946 i would hope to see a portuguese speaking officer in my time here
3577947 we have many children of native brazilians who are now naturalized citizens who have been here for eight or 10 years and would be qualified now to become police officers
3577948 it is the finding of this court that the defendant does not have a dangerous mental disorder and is no longer mentally ill
3577949 the state has not met its burden of proof by the preponderance of the evidence that the defendant should be retained
3577950 susan mooney is in better mental health than the majority of people walking up and down the street
3577951 this was our goal for thenog when we started the group in may
3577952 through our advocacy on the creditors committee and our legal standing with the german insolvency court we can accelerate the process of bringing relief to owners of aircraft that use thielert engines
3577953 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
3577954 nos enfrentamos a ella cuando les toca a otros pero apenas pasa el impacto la olvidamos y vivimos como si no existiera el viernes santo nos habla de la muerte de dios nos pide que le prestemos atenci n con o do y coraz n de disc pulos para recibir su mensaje

3577957 la cruz es rbol de vida en ella triunfa la vida sobre la muerte el amor sobre el odio la verdad sobre la mentira por eso desde el instante en que jes s el hijo de dios abraz nuestra humanidad pecadora y destinada a la muerte la cruz se convirti en el signo bendito que nos muestra el camino hacia la vida hacia la libertad y hacia el amor la muerte ya no es un asunto s lo del hombre dios se comprometi con ella y desde ese momento se transform en una causa tambi n suya por eso la muerte y con ella todo el dolor moral y el sufrimiento f sico que la anticipan no tienen la ltima palabra la ltima palabra la tiene dios que resucit a jes s y ahora est sentado a la derecha del padre abrazar al crucificado es aprender de l que la cruz asumida y ofrecida se convierte en una poderos sima fuente de vida de libertad y de amor por eso la cruz de jes s es nuestra esperanza
3577958 the south east cannot take any more people and people in the north west did not want to go
3577959 people are more than happy with the regeneration work that is happening
3577960 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3577961 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3577962 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3577963 we should consider expanding both dramatically just as liverpool and manchester expanded in the 19th century dynamic economies require dynamic economic geography
3577964 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3577965 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes
3577966 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now
3577967 its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict

3577969 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
3577970 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3577971 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3577972 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3577973 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3577974 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3577975 if i remember where i had it last i wouldnt be talking to you on the phone
3577976 that i think no man can consistently profess it without throwing the whole weight of his being against the monstrous system of injustice that lies at the foundation of all our society and if need be sacrificing himself in the battle that is i mean that i could not be a christian otherwise though i have certainly had intercourse with a great many enlightened and christian poeple who did no such thing and i confess that the apathy of religious people on this subject their want of perception of wrongs that filed me with horror have engendered in me more scepticism thatn any other thing
3577977 the movie which broke all the rules and changed the film industry
3577978 oh my god im here already doesnt this spot on the run usually seem a lot further along

3577980 more and more people in washington have decided to look for work
3577981 with fuel prices and other costs rising families are looking for ways to increase their income
3577982 by the way have you noticed yet that i am an anorexic let me list all of my body dysmorphic symptoms for you
3577983 when sceptical mps questioned the eligibility of ali kordan to be irans interior minister he believed he had the perfect riposte a law degree obtained from one of the worlds most elite institutions the university of oxford he even flaunted a graduation certificate on university headed paper purporting to award him an honorary doctorate of law for opening a new chapter in comparative legal studies now kordans extravagant claims have landed him in hot water and severely embarrassed the government of president mahmoud ahmadinejad after the university denied ever having awarded him a degree
3577984 although my cancer treatment the surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy has finished i still need medication
3577985 as a result of my cancer im now on three different drugs they cost me about 44 a month that may not sound much to some but im struggling financially
3577986 im now on statutory sick pay because ive been too unwell to work my income is 360 per month and quite frankly i have barely enough money to live on
3577987 i budget for everything i dont go out because i cant afford to socialise i cant even invite friends over for a meal because i cant afford the food
3577988 i dont eat breakfast or lunch the meals i do buy are ones that are on special offer
3577989 i cant afford fresh fruit or meat i know that isnt healthy but i simply cant afford to buy healthy food
3577990 i have stayed awake at night for hours crying thinking how can i make this work
3577991 fighting cancer is hard enough without the terrible financial worry that comes with it
3577992 i feel penalised because i have a disease that the government doesnt consider should make me exempt from prescription charges
3577993 im not against public transportation its a public safety issue
3577994 im not against public transportation i used it for many years
3577995 the road is not wide enough so its a public safety issue
3577996 this is a parkway filled with walkers bikers strollers bladers
3577997 while this helps us understand the root causes it doesnt change the fundamental problem that we are as a nation less active than we should be
3577998 all children regardless of their natural abilities should be given adequate encouragement and support to be physically active at school and at home
3577999 people must never be forced to choose between food or medication the government must act now
3578000 patients should be allowed to focus on getting better instead of worrying how theyre going to find money for prescriptions
3578001 prescription charges are a valuable source of income for the nhs in england they are expected to raise 435m in 2008 09
3578002 entitlement to free prescriptions in england is based on the principle that those who can afford to contribute should do so while those who are likely to have difficulty in paying should be protected there are extensive exemption arrangements already in place
3578003 those on a low income who are not automatically exempt can apply under the nhs low income scheme further information is available on 0845 850 1166
3578004 while there is still a decided preference for senator obama the more conservative element of the christian population is slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like
3578005 as the finer points of a wide range of issues are clarified by each nominee the initial excitement about senator obama has lost some luster to an increasing number of people whose vote is influenced by their spiritual perspectives if sen mccain converts such apprehensions into votes this will be a closer race than many have anticipated
3578006 the mccain campaign can not be satisfied with thinking evangelicals and conservative faith voters will vote for mccain as long as they thoroughly demonize obama
3578007 evangelical leaders and grassroots activists continue to tell the brody file that mccain needs to start incorporating faith and values talk into his speeches and town halls

3578014 the forest service in an attempt to bolster an outgoing presidents environmental legacy rammed through an environmental agenda that itself violates the countrys well established environmental laws
3578015 it is not in any way overturned or compromised by judge brimmers decision in wyoming today
3578016 what it does do is create two conflicting court decisions in different federal courts different states both issuing decisions with nationwide impact

3578030 i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honor but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to

3578033 i saw the brown kid paint that i know everyone wants there to be no color issues but the fact remains there is and we need to know what to say and what not to say so as to not offend anyone and that is all i am trying to accomplish
3578034 the onus here should be on disclosure although the news ltd press doesnt seem to believe in it

3578036 i said coach jagodzinski ill do anything to get on the field and he said what about switching to offense and i told him if thats what he wants ill do it
3578037 hes been to the national football league so i figured what other way to go than with coach jags
3578038 halfway through the season he told me you come over here and ill teach you everything you need need to know
3578039 thomas is a very good athlete and a very good football player
3578040 he could play offense or defense i think theyve got him at a good position for him the sky is the limit hes got his weight down and hes working hard
3578041 hes a very good athlete and very strong its hard to believe he can move around like he does being as big a man as he is
3578042 last fall camp i was just getting introduced to wide receiver
3578043 ive definitely learned a lot since last season im more comfortable on the field and i can do more with that now i know the offense i know all the positions when youre comfortable you run better routes you read coverages better
3578044 when i first switched over i was thinking too much but now its starting to be more upbeat im doing a lot less thinking of what the play is and a lot more of just where i need to be
3578045 we needed a guy to fill in a spot and thomas has done a nice job of coming over to the offense and working hard
3578046 hes still got some improvement to do hes an athletic guy he just needs experience
3578047 im not going to lie to you we had a one on one drill last week and ron put me on my back and thats the first time ive been on my back since i was a freshman in high school
3578048 it was a wakeup call but we have two of the best defensive tackles in the league and i get a chance to go against them to learn
3578049 he made four catches in the last scrimmage he held on pats he was a punter so billy is going to contribute for us this year hes done a lot of different things and he does a nice job catching the ball
3578050 my strength is that mentally i can go and line up anywhere and know what to do
3578051 i know all the positions out there and thats the benefit of having been a quarterback as well theres always room for improvement out there i definitely have to work on my speed
3578052 when he works hard he can be something special and what i hear is that hes worked hard since he got to bc
3578053 i always thought hed be better on offense than defense we only used him on offense the second half of his senior year but i saw him there and thought hed be better there hes athletic and has great feet and thats what makes an offensive lineman great
3578054 he played football basketball and baseball in high school and was a point guard at almost 6 3 like all the flutie kids hes a tremendous all around athlete hes just so determined thats billy so determined to play
3578055 he could punt kick play quarterback or wideout and hes settled in at wideout
3578056 i believe billy is going to be an explosive player
3578057 hes going to be one of those kinds of players where hes going to make a catch and exploit a weakness hes going to make a big play when nobody expects it
3578058 its good to have him on my side of the ball hes always been a great player
3578059 he works hard hes got a lot of talent hes quick off the ball i think hes going to be an advantage for us
3578060 were doing everything we can to try to get to the championship
3578061 i think were going to shock a lot of people
3578062 because sustainable was an ambiguous term and because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading
3578063 this latest asa ruling against shell sets a benchmark for all advertisers about what is and is not acceptable when making environmental claims
3578064 this ruling makes it clear that advertisers need to be especially careful when using terms like sustainable because there is no universally agreed definition about what sustainable means
3578065 we pick our battles very carefully but this particular advertisement stood out as being something quite extreme
3578066 being sustainable should be a source of competitive advantage but it is being undermined by companies investing in green spin rather than genuine investments in their sustainability strategy
3578067 we hope that companies will look at the asa ruling and realise they are not going to get away with green spin

3578080 we are pleased to welcome senator obama back to campus
3578081 he has been an inspiring role model to students in hawaii and across the nation
3578082 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3578083 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3578084 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution
3578085 when interaction gets more natural computers can be everywhere to listen to you
3578086 even in a field like astronomy its not just looking through an eyepiece but testing theories and software lets you do that
3578087 mobile phones are increasingly becoming software driven platforms although they were just for voice before
3578088 software innovation will be pervasive it will happen to other things in our lives like our cars and our tvs
3578089 lots of computing capacity and storage and at low cost
3578090 digital access is almost becoming like literacy children in poor countries need to get it too
3578091 it is wrong in the paper but it is correct on the computers
3578092 when i vote thats what i look at not the ballot
3578093 weve always voted absentee and well probably go back to that
3578094 it wasnt really clear this morning honestly because the school district didnt put signs up like they said they would
3578095 that sign out there is hidden behind the cars if i hadnt driven up further i wouldnt have seen it
3578096 ive lived in the neighborhood 37 years so its no problem finding it just getting across the mud holes
3578097 all the sites are opened on time and are furnished the way they are supposed to be
3578098 weve worked very hard to remedy the problems we saw in 2006
3578099 there are two basic problems we run into with voters
3578100 one is that they show up at the wrong polling place another is that they go to the wrong precinct table the passport system is particularly useful for those without a sample ballot

3578103 obamas boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and values
3578104 i would resent anyone suggesting that my roots are not american
3578105 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and browsing
3578106 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3578107 must employ previously released methods such as imap internet message access protocol in the concierge support level or await third party products that can tie into the security policy features delivered with the firmware 2 0 upgrade
3578108 organizationally were heading towards migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3578109 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3578110 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3578111 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3578112 affecting the implementation of mobile java j2me used by sun and nokia in their products
3578113 to gather funds for creating a cutting edge security research center in poland
3578114 its a better approach than to beg a venture capital company for money
3578115 security explorations successfully verified that suns implementation of mobile java technology used in its latest version of java wireless toolkit software is vulnerable to the discovered flaws
3578116 if a given vendor prefers to throw money for lawyers instead of spending them to improve the security of their products we cant do anything about it
3578117 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3578118 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another
3578119 customers should not stop virtual machines keep virtual machines going until we release a patch
3578120 you can also move the clock backwards on the server
3578121 vmware engineering has isolated the root cause of this issue and will reissue the various upgrade media including the esx 3 5 update 2 iso esxi 3 5 update 2 iso esx 3 5 update 2 upgrade tar and zip files by noon pst on 13 august these will be available from the page http www vmware com download vi until then vmware advises against upgrading to esx esxi 3 5 update 2 the update patch bundles will be released separately later in the week
3578122 since that location is among the 24 wetlands we have in nigeria and along the two migratory routes we suspect that the strain could have come from the migratory birds
3578123 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

3578126 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
3578127 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3578128 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3578129 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3578130 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3578131 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3578132 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3578133 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3578134 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3578135 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3578136 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3578137 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3578138 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3578139 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3578140 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3578141 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3578142 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3578143 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3578144 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

3578147 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3578148 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3578149 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3578150 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3578151 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3578152 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3578153 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3578154 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3578155 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3578156 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3578219 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos

3578225 let us be very clear resolution no 10 has no intention whatsoever to extend her term or my term or anybody elses term its only purpose is the adoption of the federal system of government
3578226 we will not allow ourselves the 22 senators to be swallowed up by 230 members of the house many of whom probably allies of the president
3578227 we are putting our support to the senate which already mustered a substantial number of senators who affixed their signatures to the resolution
3578228 and it should be so meaning to say i am not about and im sure the other co authors of this resolution are not about to allow a manipulation of the intent of the resolution which is merely to adopt the federal form of government
3578229 really good for the countrys development and for peace not only in mindanao but the entire country
3578230 its systems go for charter change and we are supporting joint congressional resolution 10 which is pending in the senate
3578231 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday
3578232 its interesting you know theyre both the same age theyre both monster superstars cultural myths almost from the 1980s into the 1990s but in so many ways theyre hard to compare
3578233 one could argue that as a musician a dancer and an entertainer michael jackson has it all over madonna by a factor of 10
3578234 hes the guy whos up there with frank sinatra bing crosby elvis presley one of the top musical performers in our cultural history
3578235 it didnt sell as well as her music did a few years ago but it was a number one album and if anyone has ever proven that shes able of reinventing herself thats madonna
3578236 madonna has managed to stay creative and to stay relevant i think she still is in the popular music scene
3578237 i dont know what shell be like at 60 but mick jagger is there and hes rocking and rolling
3578238 theres no shrewder businesswoman she could probably run a music studio
3578239 he got to the point that he was so rich so powerful and so famous that he was allowed to kind of withdraw from any kind of reality
3578240 michael jackson is the example of someone who was truly spoiled and by spoiled i mean ruined by the level of fame that he achieved
3578241 he accidentally turned himself into a parody of himself and then its kind of hard to re emerge as a serious performer
3578242 i dont think its impossible i think hes still got talent but then you tie that in with the trial and that made an awful lot of people terribly uncomfortable

3578483 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there

3578501 oh you dont even have to buy yourself a subscription
3578502 you can purchase a subscription for the local boys and girls club who could really use magazines for all those poor little children who are just dying for something to read something other than the foreclosure notices tacked up onto their front doors

3578513 in those e mails there is no incitement to kidnap or kill
3578514 i was shocked i was basically nauseous it made me sick
3578515 i think i stepped on some toes i shouldnt have stepped on
3578516 its upsetting to most of the community because dale was doing a good job he had camaraderie and he was fair i think the way they went about it was wrong
3578517 weve had three police chiefs in the last three years we dont know what the problem is power source i guess i dont know what youd call it
3578518 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3578519 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3578520 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3578521 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3578522 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3578523 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3578524 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3578525 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3578533 itas de aquellos d as que son una imagen de los enemigos internos que amenazan con minar y derrocar el dominio que dios desea que tengamos mientras aprendemos a reinar en la vida por medio de jesucristo
3578534 un hombre seg n el coraz n de dios 1 sam

3578538 david envi a joab junto con sus servidores y todo israel ellos destruyeron a los hijos de am n y pusieron sitio a rab pero david se hab a quedado en jerusal n ese fue el origen de su fracaso pues abandon el lugar de su obligaci n no quiere decir necesariamente que estuviese mal pero el estar ausente del lugar donde pertenecemos es estar expuesto a la tentaci n lo que viene a continuaci n en la historia de david se puede contar con tres sencillas frases vio envi investig y se apoder caminando sobre la azotea de su casa vio a una hermosa mujer que se estaba ba ando mand a pedir informaci n acerca de ella y la tom con esas sencillas frases tenemos una rese a gr fica de los procesos de la tentaci n cualquier tentaci n que se presente en su vida y en la m a seguir tambi n este mismo modelo comienza con un sencillo deseo puede tratarse de cualquier cosa pero el deseo est presente y hay que afrontarlo cuando se manifiesta o bien nos olvidamos de l al llegar a ese punto o se convierte en una intenci n david vio a aquella mujer hermosa la dese y comenz a trazar un plan para hacerla suya mand a pedir informaci n acerca de ella a esto sigui una acci n y david aquel hombre conforme al coraz n de dios se vio de este modo involucrado en el profundo y oscuro pecado del adulterio
3578539 un hombre conforme a su propio coraz n preste atenci n a lo que sucede en la vida de david cuando dios le env a al profeta nat n
3578540 ahora pues porque me has menospreciado y has tomado la mujer de ur as el heteo para que sea tu mujer jam s se apartar la espada de tu casa
3578541 ciertamente t lo hiciste en secreto dice dios pero yo har esto ante todo israel y en pleno d a david respondi a nat n he pecado contra jehov y nat n dijo a david jehov tambi n ha perdonado tu pecado no morir s pero como en este asunto has hecho blasfemar a los enemigos de jehov el hijo que te ha nacido morir irremisiblemente despu s nat n regres a su casa
3578542 porque el que siembra para su carne de la carne cosechar corrupci n
3578543 el se or all en los cielos nos ha mandado que amemos a nuestro pr jimo pero la canci n continua diciendo
3578544 con un poco de suerte con un poco de suerte ella nunca se enterar
3578545 mira te las puedes arreglar dios no va a hacer que te pasen esas cosas
3578546 y con un poco de suerte las cosas se resolver n pero dios nos muestra en la historia de david que esta filosof a es una mentira
3578547 con el misericordioso te muestras misericordioso e ntegro con el hombre ntegro con el limpio te muestras limpio y eres sagaz con el perverso salvas al pueblo humilde pero tus ojos humillan a los altivos ciertamente t eres mi l mpara oh jehov jehov ilumina mis tinieblas
3578548 perfecto es el camino de dios probada es la palabra de jehov el es escudo a todos los que en l se refugian
3578549 no quiero decir que ya lo haya alcanzado ni que haya llegado a la perfecci n sino que prosigo a ver si alcanzo aquello para lo cual tambi n fui alcanzado por cristo jes s
3578550 lo que yo soy para l es lo que l ser para mi y eso fue exactamente lo que descubri david

3578561 the concept of chivalry brings a bit of romance even if youve seen it a hundred times in a knights tale until you can actually hear the horses smell the sweaty leather and see the speed at which it breaks that turns it into a 3 d event
3578562 then he just stood up on his hind legs and jumped on me
3578563 he was mad because he didnt get what he wanted he was going to make his stand
3578564 and the bear just came and pounced on him for no apparent reason

3578566 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3578567 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3578568 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3578569 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3578570 atheists are people who have no invisible means of support
3578571 a dog in the video i watched fucked a human woman the dog consented to it and the woman consented to it that is like one gay man consenting to having sex with another do you approve of it
3578572 roe v wade has zero bearing on my existence other than it affects it adversely

3578575 it would be offly hard for any of you to abuse me on usenet really i
3578576 immorality the morality of those who are having a better time
3578577 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
3578578 it has become clear in recent months that a critical mass of the american
3578579 right you are correct someone hooked me i do believe in building relationships that is what christians are required to do i am amoral i am sure you know what that means so are scorpios i am being protected by the formosa rule because of my mental illness i am not targeting teh mop jockey you are and you are using me as a bait please stop i have my own fish to reel in leave me alone it is my hope that i will be able to catch a fish and reel it in for you once my retired bishop thought i was fishing for him and he took the bait alas it wasnt me and that spelled the demise of our relationship have a little bit more faith in me an eastern orthodox bishop thought i was fishing for him and willingly proudly and defiantly took the bait on public record and it wasnt even me give me a break

3578583 although the number of patients being seen at colquitt regional medical center has slowed down people are still seeking treatment and in some cases being admitted with bloody diarrhea and other symptoms
3578584 to ensure there is no ongoing risk to the public we are asking the restaurant to remain closed while we continue our investigation
3578585 its on ground beef products in a styrofoam tray with clear cellophane over it
3578586 it could have been purchased in cases or over the service counter
3578587 a specimen sample from one of the patients resulted in a match to the same strain of
3578588 the national centers of disease control and prevention and state epidemiologists agree that ground beef may be a source of the infection in colquitt county
3578589 this is not a new case what is new is that the cdc has now determined that it fit their case definition for the outbreak that began in michigan and ohio
3578590 that number has not changed the lab confirmed cases are undergoing additional testing to determine whether they also match the multi state case definition testing results are expected later this week
3578591 cross contamination is a big concern in food borne investigations and preventing it will be a focus for our team
3578592 at this point in the investigation we cannot estimate how long before the barbecue pit can reopen
3578593 while our main concern is preventing the disease from spreading and protecting the health of the community we are certainly also committed to helping the restaurant get disinfected and back to business as soon as possible
3578594 that match led our team to take a closer look at beef at the barbecue pit we learned had recently began purchasing meat from a new distributor which told them it had acquired beef from nebraska beef which had supplied the beef linked to the ohio and michigan outbreak
3578595 we had been awaiting official confirmation that the colquitt county outbreak was part of the bigger outbreak and now we have it
3578596 but no one seriously expects the actual election to mirror the current polls
3578597 we think well have a good supply for our customers

3578618 i left everything in the pool im not sure what the splits were
3578619 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
3578620 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics
3578621 theyre using a gigantic stage to make their national case against obama
3578622 it doesnt seem to be causing any uproar they may have guessed right
3578623 focused on ensuring that voters have the best information possible to make an informed decision on election day
3578624 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day

3578627 it should help to alleviate some of the inflation concerns and inflation pressures that we had been confronting assuming this sticks
3578628 my guess is its going to pay to be patient on interest rates at this point
3578629 i think itll taken some time for these headwinds to diminish
3578630 in fact i wouldnt be surprised if they didnt pick up a little more momentum first
3578631 if you wait till you have conclusive evidence you run the risk of waiting too long
3578632 the real message is that youve got to be willing at some point along the way to say you know i have enough confidence in my outlook that its time to go
3578633 from my perception some of the concerns about inflation and inflation expectations seem to have diminished
3578634 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint

3578640 fraud isnt just a cost of doing business it also undermines consumer confidence
3578641 with the new stock trading module we extended the existing functionality of our vip fraud detection service to proactively identify fraud before damage can be done preventing pump and dump types of schemes makes a huge difference and its one only verisign can provide
3578642 it is difficult to understand what exactly the epa has been doing during the assessment if they werent interested in the results of extensive site investigations especially given that most of the extensive work programmes were undertaken to satisfy requests from the epa
3578643 the alarming number of factual errors and invented concerns is a major worry for anyone trying to start a sustainable project in western australia
3578644 the epa deliberately ignored all of its previous approvals for solar salt operations in wa including its positive conclusions about the lack of environmental impacts of these particular projects
3578645 if theres an accidental or release of bitterns through natural processes for example sea level rise and extreme surge events and that material finds its way into the marine environment it can cause serious impact

3578761 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi

3578763 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3578764 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3578782 a lot of sites have been known previously and to our knowledge nothing has ever happened so its just fair that in a democratic society this information should be in the public domain
3578783 to raise the bogey of threats is really just off the point the point is the public is entitled to this information
3578784 i think it would just highlight the inaccuracy of whoever has put this together
3578785 i havent seen it but i dont my wife doesnt grow gm products and has no intention of growing gm products so people will make their own judgement about the accuracy and the veracity of that map and that document
3578786 the chinese want this product i was there four weesk ago they are buying gm canola out of canada and they want us to re enter the market and be competitive

3578788 explosive diarrhea at the daycare on the afternoon of 8 3 00
3578789 t he cause of the e coli o157 h7 outbreak was due to a sponge being used simultaneously for wiping down a changing table and wiping down a table used for serving meals
3578790 what is the hemolytic uremic syndrome and what do i need to know about it
3578791 there are no easy answers but there are simple answers we must have the courage to do what we know is morally right
3578792 one of the sad signs of our times is that we have demonized those who produce subsidized those who refuse to produce and canonized those who complain
3578793 how to stop high speed police chases suicidal bridge jumpers and save money too
3578794 we are hoping to have 150 producer who are not just producers each one will be a business and will potentially employ more people plus when you talk about distribution youre talking about transportation truck drivers corporations packing houses all of those spinoff companies that will help in the economic area
3578795 i came off that turn and felt like i really didnt spend much energy on the way out
3578796 and just used that extra energy in the second lap and i think it worked pretty well
3578797 i just swam my own race completely this morning and couldnt have done anything better
3578798 obviously when you hear the crowd cheer you realise what it was
3578799 i heard it was only point 0 faster than what i did so i knew i had a shot
3578800 it gives me confidence that i know i can swim my own race under pressure
3578801 having that world record go before me i knew i had to swim my own race and not get drawn into the games about times
3578802 i came out on top and im happy with the way i swam
3578803 i dont think ill have an outside lane for the final tomorrow
3578804 so i can be close to the action in lane four
3578805 i was talking to eamon before the race and he said you have to go sub 48 seconds to make the final
3578806 class size is one thing our class size is a lot smaller and discipline is limited you know very little discipline problems i think we are trying to be as competitive as we can with salaries as well
3578807 i did speak to her after the cross country and she was just so excited to be there and so happy and it really is just a dream come true for her
3578808 shes worked for many many years to get to this point so its quite extraordinary
3578809 on friday actually i nearly got on a plane and flew over to hong kong i was just too excited
3578810 megans fairly lucky on the family farm here in the adelaide hills shes got pretty much everything she needed on the property to be able to continue training her horses so where some people might not have been able to continue training their horses fully she could continue doing everything here
3578811 ill remember him and ill do whatever it takes to make sure it doesnt happen again and no one ever forgets about him
3578812 im a firm believer that what goes around comes around
3578813 i hope that people look at this case and care about other children in the community
3578814 people realize how innocent and dependent children are and that they need the people around them to care for them and not torture them
3578815 we used that defense because thats what the evidence told us
3578816 we respect the jurys verdict but we just have a different view of the evidence thats how it goes
3578817 i lay every ounce of blame and responsibility in this case at the feet of jon phillips and sarah berry every single ounce of it
3578818 i cried the first time i saw the pictures of chandler everyone should it should upset you if it doesnt somethings missing in your make up
3578819 everyone that has been a part of this trial has been affected from the doctors to the emts to the social workers
3578820 ill remember him and ill do whatever it takes to make sure it doesnt happen again and no one ever forgets about him
3578821 we thank the denver district attorneys office for its hard work in the prosecution and convictions of john phillips and sarah berry we also thank the community for its support and continued prayers we continue to grieve the loss of out little boy chandler will never be forgotten

3578833 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3578834 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3578835 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3578836 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3578837 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3578838 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3578839 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3578840 it is almost impossible to trace the material being smuggled out by the iranians
3578841 unless you know exactly what type of technology they are trying to build the smugglers can collect various parts from various sources that mask the iranians intent
3578842 the iranians spread their acquisitions program over a huge area we were able to stop one recent acquisition only because we obtained the key numbers of the component they wanted to build on a computer disk our best hope now is that we can delay the process we will not be able to stop it
3578843 there was no way the germans were ever willing to provide german technology to help the iranians
3578844 this has been our position and is adhered to strictly
3578845 in the past mr semnar was involved in the transportation of sensitive deliveries to iran
3578846 he also seems to be involved in international drug trafficking and tried to involve nordair in schleswig holstein i rejected these intentions

3578849 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3578850 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3578851 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3578852 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3578853 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3578887 you do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish

3578895 and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and his sons from among the children of israel to do the work for the children of israel in the tabernacle of meeting and to make atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among the children of israel when the children of israel come near the sanctuary

3578899 furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes and swore that i would not cross over the jordan and that i would not enter the good land which the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance
3578900 and when you have seen it you also shall be gathered to your people as aaron your brother was gathered for in the wilderness of zin during the strife of the congregation you rebelled against my command to hallow me at the waters before their eyes
3578901 because you did not believe me to hallow me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which i have given them
3578902 something eternal and intrinsic to the divine nature requires blood

3578921 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3578922 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
3578923 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3578924 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3578925 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3578926 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3578927 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3578928 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3578929 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3578930 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3578931 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3578932 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3578933 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3578934 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3578935 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3578936 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
3578937 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm
3578938 i dont see anything happening today tomorrow or the next day
3578939 we are not racists we are just activists protecting our rights
3578940 we are always looking for solution partners who can help us bring value to our clients business operations abacos innovative product suite in 2d amp 3d gis achievement combined with the companys approach towards customer satisfaction is an excellent addition to our solution offerings
3578941 gis is an area where needs and relevance are expanding extraordinarily and together we can deliver the very best in gis and this partnership offers strong support for our business in this part of world
3578942 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
3578943 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3578944 he has no power to do that matters related to student intakes is under the jurisdiction of higher educational institutions
3578945 this is somewhat extraordinary it is weird that a malay leader should voice out something under article 153 and i am giving this opinion as a professional for the good of the country and not only for bumiputeras
3578946 the majority of students in critical fields like accounting and pharmacy in public higher learning institutions are non malays and in private higher learning institutions 90 per cent of the students are non malays
3578947 our constitution stresses balance this is a statistic which should be understood by any leader government or opposition body and nobody should begrudge uitm as the only public university for bumiputeras
3578948 as a leader we should speak carefully and not just base our statements on our own perception many uitm students now hold top positions in both the public and private sector
3578949 if pakatan rakyat becomes the ruling government not only can they open up uitm to non bumiputeras they can also change the constitution including turning the country into a republic
3578950 i hope malaysians will think carefully before they make their decisions and not be influenced by those who speak only for their own political benefit to gain the support of malays
3578951 i liken the person who made the statement as a kerbau dicucuk hidung just a follower i could not fault those who push for this as they are fighting for their race
3578952 but abdul khalid as a leader should think before making such a statement and not betray his own race
3578953 the existence of uitm is in accordance with the new economic policy to eradicate poverty and restructure society
3578954 between darkness and light it really is just one line apart
3578955 xna is a powerful tool that you can use to develop any game be it 2d or 3d and there are no limitations its even possible to develop commercial games on xna
3578956 with xna it is possible for a two man outfit to develop a game with one person handling the programming aspects and the other focusing on creating the graphics and art assets
3578957 theres definitely a lot of potential for small game studios to succeed using xna

3578965 it hurts me shes in that shape but to leave her on the side of the road really makes me mad
3578966 they were told it was round trip they knew they were supposed to pick her up
3578967 it was bad because i ran out of oxygen while i was out there
3578968 the cheapest one was 144 dollars up front which i didnt have nobody would help me nobody
3578969 you cant fix it now she rode home like a dog in the back of a truck
3578970 if it rained like a motherfucker and people were like cheering and laughing and obama was undaunted and the people were undaunted they all just overcame it like well overcome the bastards during the election season to win wouldnt that be great
3578971 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3578972 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3578973 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3578974 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3578975 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3578976 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3578977 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3578978 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3578979 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage
3578980 ultimately we could also find out how massage helps not just exercise induced muscle injury but swelling and pain associated with other medical conditions as well
3578981 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3578982 it is the intent of the legislature to develop and implement interagency strategies in service training programs and activities that will improve school attendance and reduce school crime and violence including vandalism hate crimes bullying including acts bullying committed personally or by means of an electronic act

3578985 i competed with benji gil basically the whole spring training it must have been the very last day i didnt know i was going to make the team manager jerry manuel called me in his office and basically said call your father tell him you made the team were going to be leaving tomorrow so get your stuff all packed i was just so happy that i got to that level so quick
3578986 i played at such a high level and then i was at a lower level in the south coast league

3578988 the only people in glasgow who im aware are against them are drug dealers who would rather not be filmed going about their business
3578989 in order to meet targets police are now classifying incidents as crimes that would previously have been dealt with informally classified differently or ignored
3578990 section 5 of the public order act allows police to arrest anyone for threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour within the sight of a person likely to be caused harassment alarm or distress before the arrival of sanction detections the police only evoked section 5 for a public order offence but now that police can now claim a sanction detection for an arrest under section 5 minor crime and even innocuous activities appear in a different light
3578991 everyone arrested gives a sample of dna which automatically guarantees a criminal record number on the police national computer
3578992 we are in discussions with the americans to make them aware of our system
3578993 we are bringing more and more people to justice but they are the wrong people like other targets they measure what was chosen to be measured not whether the public are getting a good service
3578994 not only do the police seem intent on criminalising those whose offences if they can be regarded as offences at all are trivial like holding open a lift door p 49 they are accused of concentrating on easy to deal with offending like speeding while the real criminals seem to be getting away with it they are slow to respond to calls even to serious crimes taking place often slack about follow up and unwilling to tackle persistent anti social behaviour that blights neighbourhoods
3578995 the deluge of paperwork imposed on the police by whitehall means that just 14 of officer time is spent on patrol p
3578996 but can you explain to me exactly why or how our civil liberties are even remotely infringed by our being
3578997 its offensive to the millions of people across the world who do live in such states and who regard the uk rightly as a beacon of freedom and democracy
3578998 as for cctv i know of no mps whose constituents have approached them asking for fewer cctv cameras in their constituencies

3579101 some of these people that are coming across the border are from other central and south american countries
3579102 but there is quite a large number of people that are coming across the border that are of middle eastern origin as well as asian origin a lot of these are single they have no families i dont think theyre coming here to cut our grass or work in our chicken plants so i think it is an extremely important issue that we must solve

3579106 well first of all a fingerprint is hardly personal data because you leave it on glasses and silverware and articles all over the world theyre like footprints theyre not particularly private
3579107 fingerprints constitute extremely personal information for which there is clearly a high expectation of privacy

3579370 im tense about it because ill be lying awake worrying about it all night
3579371 component returned failure code 0xc1f30001 ns error not initialized nsixmlhttprequest
3579372 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3579373 i just wanted to be out at the 50 metre point and thats where i was
3579374 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3579375 i knew park is strong in the last 50 metres
3579376 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3579377 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3579378 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3579379 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3579380 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3579381 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3579382 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3579383 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3579384 music videos and flowery speeches are one thing but the shelling of a city that you view as one of your heartland is not done lightly
3579385 clearly this is going to be a signal point in his legacy
3579386 if you can find five acres of land surround it with a fence and stay on it and operate it for 10 years you can do it too
3579387 where am i going to go i cant park them on the street
3579388 it is not business as usual anymore with the russians and there are consequences for doing what they are doing
3579389 russia has one foot integrated into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in it
3579390 whether they havent achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives
3579391 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3579392 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3579393 we are not happy with the way the united states has been behaving especially the way the united states has been propping up mr saakashvili over the past few years
3579394 i hope we continue normal relations with the united states and the rest of the international community
3579395 we have equal interests between the russian federation and the united states we should look and try to resolve this international crisis
3579396 would make suzaku even angrier lelouch puts a reason behind it and makes it sound firm like it was what was meant to happen
3579397 im feeling good feeling fresh so ill definitely put my hand up for selection
3579398 at this point in time id consider myself as playing
3579399 thank goodness for that we are not kidding ourselves but it is a first step and its a great feeling
3579400 theres no doubt that we were by far the better team but at 1 0 down we were looking down the barrel
3579401 the duke drives you mad at times he had you pulling your hair out but then the next minute he can have you jumping out of your seat
3579402 wit is not in a position to organise a safe and secure venue in georgia nor to play at an alternative venue
3579403 subsequently informed by the georgian football federation also speaking on behalf of wit that the squad could not travel due to security concerns
3579404 uefa will contact the clubs and national associations concerned in due time to communicate the rules applicable to this single match
3579405 its not just press releases its pounding the pavement talking face to face with voters
3579406 its the biggest relief in the world to know phase two starts
3579407 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3579408 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3579409 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3579410 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3579411 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3579412 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3579413 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3579414 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3579415 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3579416 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3579417 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3579418 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3579419 being selected for this award speaks volumes about the atmosphere around the grizzly track and field program and adams state college as a whole im honored to be selected
3579420 we are very happy to award a 2 500 postgraduate scholarship to john who is an outstanding student and national class thrower
3579421 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3579422 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3579423 just mucking about on my moog minimoog analog mono synth one of the many old and newer analog synths i have lying around here
3579424 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
3579425 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
3579426 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
3579427 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
3579428 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
3579429 i rented out this space and found my own distributor because i loved what i was doing and i wanted to give it a try
3579430 i was hoping if i moved quickly i wouldnt lose any customers
3579431 at margaritas we love fresh flowers we were so disappointed and sad when they closed
3579432 the first day that pats opened i bought a bunch of flowers in so our customers would know they were back in business
3579433 i raised my family in the 16th and 17th area
3579434 i am so happy to see the growth on the south side to be a part of the expansion and the development is so cool
3579435 the reason pat received the attention she did is because we love pat
3579436 and she has the good flower skills and some good business skills in representing the community as well as a business woman
3579437 tons of customers have returned and all of our loyal regulars have returned as well
3579438 must not stop marathon keep going marathon car oh my god
3579439 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3579440 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3579441 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3579442 tengo la ntima convicci n de no haber cometido delito alguno en toda mi vida
3579443 wie had dit na acht jaar gedacht die ouwe vos kan het nog steeds
3579444 mijn grootvader was altijd een enorme fan van het nederlands elftal maar als er dan een belangrijke wedstrijd kwam riep hij altijd dat ze wel zouden verliezen daarmee haalde hij de teleurstelling een beetje weg voor als ze echt verloren dat gevoel kende ik op weg naar deze spelen ook maar weinig mensen hadden echt vertrouwen in me ik hoop dat ik iedereen nu positief heb verrast
3579445 nous pratiquons le bouddhisme mais restons avant tout des occidentaux
3579446 hier heb ik de laatste jaren zo hard voor gewerkt
3579447 je stelt van tevoren een plan op en dan hoop je dat het werkt dat ik nu zo gemakkelijk de finale heb gehaald geeft enorm veel voldoening
3579448 ik hoop dat ik voor de vierde keer op rij voor de medailles kan strijden
3579449 de kans dat ik ga winnen is klein maar ik hoop dat ik morgen een plaatsje hoger eindig dan waarmee in ben begonnen de vierde stek in atlanta 1996
3579450 dat het mijn laatste race wordt daar denk ik niet over na ik wil presteren en ik denk dat ik nog een stukje harder kan dan in de halve finale
3579451 upon arrival police found the body of a man aged in his late 30s or early 40s a police spokeswoman said
3579452 it appears the man has fallen head first in a pier hole
3579453 they use their laptop for everything they know heaps about computers
3579454 mainly simple and compound sentences but attempting complex sentences varying the beginning and length of their sentences
3579455 bigpond now gives ipod users an alternative place to purchase their favourite music in a format that will work on their player
3579456 bigpond is changing the online music game by creating a truly open world that puts consumers in the driving seat
3579457 the future of the music industry relies on the growth in legitimate digital music sales
3579458 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3579459 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3579460 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3579461 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3579462 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3579463 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rainforests their peoples and their species
3579464 oil access roads are a main catalyst of deforestation and associated impacts
3579465 inadequate due to a lack of independence in the review process and a lack of comprehensive analyses of the long term cumulative and synergistic impacts of multiple oil and gas projects across the wider region
3579466 with a team of developers from multiple companies around the world contributing weve continued to make the imedia browser even more useful than ever
3579467 we continue to receive comments from mac users who appreciate the ability to quickly access their media libraries using the imedia browser as a standalone application or as an embedded part of their favorite applications
3579468 previous versions of fotomagico used their own proprietary version of ilife integration keeping up with all the changes used to be a lot of work this has gotten much easier since we migrated to karelias imedia framework since its open source and a lot of developers are contributing to it it gets updated quickly when the media repositories change
3579469 the increase in oil and commodity prices is damaging corporate profits
3579470 its very hard for the boj to move despite the increase in prices
3579471 if the border patrol doesnt get you the chicken and burgers will go vegan
3579472 we think that mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the u s they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier staple diet of corn tortillas beans rice fruits and vegetables
3579473 i was trying not to watch the race before i didnt really want to see what time they went but you cant help but hearing obviously with the loud speaker
3579474 it was only just by a little bit and i was feeling pretty good in the warm up to so i thought id have a go and try and go a little bit faster and im really glad i did
3579475 it is another race and if you do it any differently to how you do it before youre probably not going to swim as well so you just shut out all the distractions and have fun
3579476 i fear that the head of state would like the european officials to tolerate the poor state state of justice in romania and the blocking of the fight with the great corruption
3579477 entitles any entity of the european union to make comments that do not please us about any of the institutions
3579478 i just got some new stuff in my shoes presumably he means the orthotics the doctors have told him to wear and this is the first day i ran in them
3579479 my feet area little sore right now so its something i have to get used to once i get used to it and get the soreness out ill be back out here
3579480 i appreciate everything that t2 motorsports rocky and trevor bayne have done for me
3579481 the richeson family has been around racing for many decades and i think working with josh will prove to be beneficial for me im recharged and looking forward to bristol and the rest of the season
3579482 i couldnt think of a more appropriate way to celebrate veterans day than to pay tribute to all of the veterans and their families who have sacrificed so much for this country
3579483 everyone at khi takes great pride in representing such an incredible organization and we hope this program will help educate the public about the tremendous work they do to support our countrys heroes
3579484 were tremendously pleased to have an opportunity to share such an important day with pir and khi as we pay tribute to those who deserve it most
3579485 as an organization of combat veterans vfw deeply appreciates pirs and khis effort in honoring todays warriors and those of the past as well as their assistance in spreading the message of respect and recognition to better help make the public understand the real meaning of veterans day
3579486 you have to go out and run your own pace this place anderson motor speedway is a lot like pensacola five flags speedway in florida i have had a lot of races around there you just have to go out there and run a pace you can run the whole race because if you go too fast at the beginning you will not have anything left for the end i focused on that if they were on me then so be it
3579487 i believe someone missed a shift there on the restart and we had nowhere to go
3579488 i tried to turn down but it wasnt quite quick enough it tore the whole right front suspension up on the car but the guys did a great job putting it back together and getting us back out there
3579489 i told my dad and ricky turner my crew chief to just tell me when there were 10 laps to go i had a good car and was just sitting there waiting
3579490 he middleton was burning his tires off the car i couldnt quite deal with him coming off the corner he has just a little bit bigger motor than i do i was just sitting there trying to work him each lap before that last caution i believe i could have got him as i was under him coming off of turn four if that caution wouldnt have come out i think i would have gotten him and tried for the win
3579491 he is in a position where he has to go and i was in a position to do whatever i want so i made sure i went nice and slow through the middle of the corner and nice and hard off
3579492 that is how you have to run a place like this the one time you drive in there too hard you slide up and it gives him a little window under you then it is over if i kept in on the bottom he didnt have anywhere to go that is what i tried to focus on the whole race
3579493 you can run all the way down to the inside pit wall so that is where i tried to go if you tried to get under me there you would go head on into the tires so that wouldnt work i was also real good off of turn four so it worked out in the end
3579494 casey did a great job tonight i have never raced with him before
3579495 i expected to be able to pull away from him but i couldnt
3579496 i just want to thank bill elliott for believing in me and taking the chance on me
3579497 i think we are going to have a lot of momentum after this race i also want to thank ricky turner and all of these guys that worked on the car this weekend we will gain on this a bit and see if we can get a win soon that was probably the most fun race i have been in throughout my whole racing career
3579498 we got a lot of bonus points today i think we got every bonus point you could get here
3579499 that is what it is all about this is the second race this year that we have led every lap you cannot get passed in the points if you get every point available out of a weekend so that is what we try to do
3579500 i think in many ways design is about looking at a diverse range of problems and solving them but
3579501 mexico city ap money sent home by mexican migrants declined by 2 2 percent in the first six
3579502 they re ruining what has been one of the greatest economies in the world rogers said
3579503 lil wayne is making a foray into the beverage industry with plans to launch his own brand of
3579504 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
3579505 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
3579506 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3579507 with the increased attention on sports in china this olympics year and the rapidly growing popularity of basketball in asia we feel this movie will work well for television and new media content buyers looking to connect with the youth demo of today
3579508 well they cant even come up with a cure for the common cold
3579509 the concern we harbor now about malaca angs backing for a resolution for a shift to federalism has nothing to do with our principles but our concern has a lot to do with malaca angs track record of political maneuvers
3579510 its been part of their plan all along thats been their plan since 2004 especially when the hello garci controversy broke out they have been working to amend the charter not to improve our economic provisions but for political considerations
3579511 the people wont allow it neither will the senate or congress during the so many times they tempted to amend the charter the people have spoken
3579512 and now we segway into handing you a stick that you will go pee on
3579513 fresh credit worries and the subsequent share falls on wall street are weighing on sentiment
3579514 despite oils falls investors remain cautious as concerns about fundamentals such as economies and corporate earnings pervade the markets
3579515 we remain wary of any rebound in oil and commodity prices as it could trigger a partial reversal of recent moves
3579516 although markets have moved quickly we expect further consolidation of new ranges up ahead and shift our euro dollar forecasts to 1 51 and 1 47 for one month and three months respectively
3579517 theres a swing in mood from supply concerns to falling demand particularly in the united states but attention is beginning to turn to europe and asian economies as well
3579518 all in all we are maintaining a bearish trading posture in quest of additional price weakness to the 108 area a level that appears achievable by weeks end
3579519 were trying to be the gate keepers for the community
3579520 somebodys got to do it we have to start somewhere we arent going to get better if we dont start somewhere
3579521 you might need this drug today but maybe you again need it next week and then people are watching you it could be a big brother thing kind of situation
3579522 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging
3579523 armchair theoreticians and practitioners are never the same more so when one is a politician that the end justifies the means in politics is amoral good governance and morality are defined by those in power and never by philosophers
3579524 blair may have had his nations interests in mind for supporting the us invasion of iraq much as dr mahathir may have had his reasons to adopt the buy british last policy
3579525 its just like if a police officer chats to somebody its part of the investigative process
3579526 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3579527 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3579528 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3579529 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3579530 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
3579531 we have a real opportunity on our hand over the next couple of years to show people that we have world class cars that were bringing here to the u s
3579532 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane

3579574 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3579575 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3579576 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3579577 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3579578 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3579579 and hopefully some of us will hear the at the end of the week
3579580 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3579581 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3579582 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3579583 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3579584 none of us lives for oneself and no one dies for oneself
3579585 am i willing to put my life on the line for this cause
3579586 it has come to my attention that water is seeping in and pooling under the white latex coating that was supposed to protect these aircraft from the elements and preserve them in a saleable condition
3579587 when this occurs it is someones job to drain the water by piercing the bubble with a pin or some other cutting edge piece of bubble bursting technology no doubt purchased out of the rnzafs operational funding

3579604 i enjoy watching yi play because he often makes the right read when it comes to half court offense when to post when to slip screens when to pop out higher as a pressure release man he is not putting up the numbers he did early on but based on his mental game he will get back in gear and be a force in this league
3579605 steadily making his mark looking for his shot more and exhibiting genuine confidence
3579606 yis career high 29 points most coming from long 2 pointers showed that he is the other dirk like talent from this draft combining excellent size with great shooting skills and movement adding 10 rebounds three assists three steals and a blocked shot is the stuff p j carlesimo hopes to get from kd
3579607 its hard for the average fan to understand just how tall most of these nba players are most of these players move so well that they look like much smaller men remember most of the football and baseball players we see on tv are about the same height as nba point guards or smaller yi is a great example hes so fluid that he looks like an ordinarily sized man but then youll see him finish a hook shot by throwing the ball down toward the rim and realize hes about a foot taller than most football and baseball players
3579608 another new years wall hitter is yi who just completed his worst three game scoring streak of the season yi scored just 15 points total on 6 for 26 shooting but i like the fact that he still grabbed 20 rebounds blocked three shots and made three steals in those games to get through the wall rookies must continue fighting and work on making plays each possession
3579609 so far january is proving to be yis worst month in the nba in terms of raw production but i still love what i see from him on most nights from a talent perspective his level of agility and coordination is just so impressive to watch and he knows how to play he could see a jump in production next season similar to rudy gays jump from 10 8 ppg as a rookie to over 19 ppg this season
3579610 yi continues to surprise me with his overall talent level because as good as al horford is yi would win a lot of arguments over who would have been a better pick for the hawks yis got more upside as a scorer and probably projects better as a shot blocker too having to adjust to the american game and culture unlike al suggests that when he figures it out hell stand alongside durant as one of the top two rookies of this class greg oden will be considered a rookie next season

3579620 the data is likely to show a further rise in unemployment the figures will confirm that we are entering a crucial stage when the decisions taken by the bank of england and the government will have a major impact on how many jobs are lost as the slowdown bites in 2009
3579621 the bank of england needs to address growing expectations of recession across the economy by cutting interest rates to boost business and the government needs to put more money in the pockets of public sector workers to raise flagging consumer confidence
3579622 the labour market data should show a faster pace of rising unemployment

3579631 it is not business as usual anymore with the russians and there are consequences for doing what they are doing
3579632 russia has one foot integrated into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in it
3579633 whether they havent achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives
3579634 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3579635 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3579636 we are not happy with the way the united states has been behaving especially the way the united states has been propping up mr saakashvili over the past few years
3579637 i hope we continue normal relations with the united states and the rest of the international community
3579638 we have equal interests between the russian federation and the united states we should look and try to resolve this international crisis
3579639 that was one of my fastest times in the past couple of years
3579640 so i have a lot of confidence going into the final tomorrow morning
3579641 after the heat last night it didnt feel as easy as it probably should have
3579642 the first 100 this morning was really easy so i took it out a bit harder than i did last night
3579643 im an illiterate who has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that i can get
3579644 you dont necessarily have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country john mccain is aware of the internet
3579645 basically john is a technological troglodyte and proud of it
3579646 broadband will soon be an indispensable communication technology affecting the way we learn the way we work and the way we communicate
3579647 however at the dawn of this digital age those who could benefit the most from this economically empowering technology are also those most likely to be left without access because of where they live or how much money they make
3579648 the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength
3579649 what concerns me is that mccain will do as george bush did which is to make technology an issue related to how he raises money to run the government or to fund campaigns and not as an independent issue that is important to grow america
3579650 technology for the bush administration is a total non issue even though that was the thing that drove most growth in 1992 to 2003 and the reason i think hed be led to that is because hes a guy who doesnt understand anything about technology in the first place
3579651 i think that the people who determine his tech policies like former fcc chairman michael powell and a few others who were his top advisors will talk as bush has talked about getting advanced telecommunications services to all americans
3579652 but mainly their model is to allow the industry to determine what all this means which is the danger
3579653 far too little oversight to the good things in the 1996 telecommunications act
3579654 making sure there were equal opportunities to participate in the industry afforded to women and minorities and small businesses
3579655 there was a rush to essentially allow industry players to get into each others businesses and consolidate in the industry
3579656 their bush and mccain belief is that government should just get out of the way and let the private sector do it clearly in the financial markets the private sector has done a horrible job
3579657 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3579658 why is it that every time i think i know the answers someone goes and changes the questions
3579659 peter please im an x man i dont shoot people im just trying to make a point
3579660 i have spent over 35 years in the caribbean as a sailor and as a realtor so i know this region of the world very well
3579661 i never expected there would be any lead generation results from my experiment i was just experimenting and after two years of blogging it has been confirmed that my vision of creating an internet real estate site which allows people from all over the world to participate in real estate sales and purchases is really possible
3579662 one hundred percent of our caribbean real estate business is currently coming from inquiries from our caribbean blog site
3579663 we are receiving inquires each day from a total of 16 countries our www eastbayrealestate com site has also added over 10 percent to our revenue of our san francisco bay area real estate practice before blogging all of our bay area real estate customers came from referrals so this has been a significant addition to our bay area real estate business revenue
3579664 bloggers are the most open and sharing community i have found on the internet
3579665 it was a dream come true just to race here
3579666 was to reach over the table and punch the doctor who was giving me the news
3579667 if certain tests had come back elevated my parents would have stepped in

3579671 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment please leave me alone
3579672 how we address these gaps now will serve as a direct predictor of how well we will handle future events especially those involving emerging re emerging and pandemic infectious diseases
3579673 if we cant counter tb how can we counter terrorism
3579674 if we cant prevent dope smuggling how can we prevent terrorism
3579675 if we cant get passports for american citizens in under 6 months how can we prevent terrorism
3579676 preparedness is a process and not an event and people need to realize that we are light years ahead of where we were six years ago
3579677 internal links can really drive a page but if the internal anchor text is too well aligned with the anchor text page title and headings that might suppress rankings for the target keyword
3579678 your outbound links help define what community your site belongs in
3579679 if too many pages are near the exact size or similar in size to many spam documents it may seem like the document has a higher probability of being spam google has also been growing more stringent with what they are willing to let in their index by requiring a minimum page rank threshold to allow documents in their primary index longer and more authoritative documents are better than breaking articles into many shorter pages
3579680 clear organization not only helps search engines understand how documents relate to each other but also effectively distributes your link authority
3579681 some types of documents are frequently updated while others are rarely updated make sure your page matches your sites profile
3579682 i actually think having a few misspellings in a page makes it easier to rank because there are so many less legitimate pages using those misspellings but if misspellings might cost credibility points with end users it might make sense to have a person make a misspelling in a page comment or in one of your inbound links
3579683 if you can get designers to think that your stuff is better because it validates more of them will pay attention to you subscribe to your feed and link at your site otherwise i believe validation is somewhat over hyped

3579690 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent

3579695 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3579696 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3579697 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3579698 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3579699 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3579700 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3579701 physicists have been telling us for decades such effects are physically impossible the only physical effect would be heating a cell they said they ridiculed epidemiologists

3579704 we have three guys we believe we can win with i know its a luxury in college football these days i feel very good about it were just training them all like theyre going to be the starter
3579705 there was some struggling going on early i think they were pressing
3579706 but since practice six theyve really made great strides all in different ways
3579707 its not a case where were not playing well and thats why the decision has been hard
3579708 really all three of us have come out and competed hard and made plays i think thats made the decision tough i think a lot of teams in the pac 10 would like a quarterback situation like we have
3579709 my wife and i did everything in this house except lay the carpet
3579710 we have made it through several floods following mitigation measures without any major flood related damages
3579711 we traveled here on weekends to get away from peoria and its traffic
3579712 a guy brought me here to go duck hunting once and thats all it took even though karen and i knew the towns flood history we liked it so much that we moved here permanently we also knew that we had to be prepared
3579713 when we built in 1995 i got the base flood elevation bfe for the area from a local official
3579714 we stayed through all of the high water events except the one in june 2008 we didnt have any gas
3579715 the illinois commerce commission passed a law which required the gas to be shut off during flooding events
3579716 once you get prepared for it its no big thing if you are going to live here you need to prepare
3579717 we have residents who are tearing down their homes and planning to move out of the area rather than face another flood

3579720 i can poke holes in your theory therefore mine is correct
3579721 whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will never be forgiven he is guilty of an eternal sin
3579722 see how silly these atheists are this proves we were right about them all along they have nothing meaningful to say
3579723 no gretchen im saying youre misinterpreting mark and i say that based on what other christians have said to me over a period of a few decades
3579724 its gods word just interpreted the way i want it to be
3579725 i tell you the truth all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will never be forgiven he is guilty of an eternal sin
3579726 if one doesnt agree with my particular interpretation of the bible then theyre hellbound
3579727 she is not to be stoned but removed from the church
3579728 the sin at least as committed by the pharisees is not
3579729 then satan stood up against israel and moved david to number israel
3579730 now again the anger of the lord burned against israel and it incited david against them to say go number israel and judah
3579731 if one doesnt agree with my particular interpretation of the bible then theyre hellbound
3579732 she is not to be stoned but removed from the church
3579733 i dunno jj i viewed argystokes youtube link and it looks like the rational responders make some interesting and valid points
3579734 i reject your silly hypothesis and my logic is unassailable
3579735 dont know but ill see if i can develop a way to find out
3579736 only group for which it is still ok to persecute
3579737 what ive seen from the jesus mythers has been at best baroque speculation that gets cut off by occams razor
3579738 the last group that people overwhelmingly agree is ok to hate
3579739 you guys are being seen and heard stop it or theyll get mad at us
3579740 why are atheists the most hated pieces of crap in the shitcan
3579741 let the religious moderates walk over you so we can lose this culture war already

3579746 i joe blow reject god jesus and the holy spirit
3579747 if your party nominated a generally well qualified person for president who happened to be an atheist would you vote for that person
3579748 claiming that anyone who believes in god is delusional is not justified
3579749 your argument is wrong because you are stupid liberal conservative a scientist
3579750 i have also seen my fair share of fundamentalists avoid using these as well they have a
3579751 christians have pissed me off so it doesnt matter how juvenile my response is
3579752 suppose the next time we go swimming you get out in deep water and cant get back people yell at you from the shore but one person wades out and throws you a life preserver on a rope so he can pull you in you can reject and yell insults at the people on the shore without doing yourself any harm but if you reject the guy with the life preserver youd be in danger of drowning
3579753 christians cannot repudiate romans as to homosexuality written by paul
3579754 this is just one of many many places in the gospels where jesus refers to the eternal punishment of hell a fate he describes using imagery of everlasting fire and burning
3579755 this is why the blasphemy challenge is effective it gets people talking about these issues
3579756 will by then be reduced to a trivial voluntary association with a large portfolio of heritage property
3579757 regular churchgoers will be too few to show up in representative national surveys
3579758 youtube reader skraps notes that the google property has recently banned the popular atheist commentator nick gisburne
3579759 unpardonable christian sin since january of 2004 when i apostasized from christianity and theism in general and ive done it in the most creative and blasphemous ways imaginable ones that would make the militant atheists behind the blasphemy challenge blush someitmes it invlved sex masturbation porn and so on i also attended a church a used to go to and i went last year to their easter service sat silently went up at the altar call waited for some people to come over and lay hands on me to pray for me they mostly knew me and knew i had left the faith and probably assumed i was coming back and the head guy is one of my personal enemies as he and i have butted heads even back when i was still christian i looked up at them at him especially and said

3579765 the overwhelming majority of republican senators have pledged to protect october 1 as american energy freedom day so we can reduce dependence on foreign oil and lower the cost of gas at the pump
3579766 many people arent aware that the bans on drilling must be renewed every year and all we have to do is allow these prohibitions to expire on october 1 we will actively oppose any effort to extend the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale
3579767 theres been a great response already but frankly every senator should sign on because its irrational to say
3579768 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3579769 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3579770 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them

3579948 actually most farmers have obeyed the warning because the awareness about the environmental damage has existed on us since we suffered the consequences of the damage every dry season most villagers here must have suffered lack of water as the result the villagers must hunt for it in another source that is relatively distant about 1 km from here and the worse is that the water source is laid on such a steep location that it is difficult to reach
3579949 few years ago the condition was quite different we have asked the government to build a water reservoir but so far all they have done is just promising there is no realization
