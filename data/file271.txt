2710004 even as the increasingly economically misdirected agenda of the one time prudent gordon brown slides down to reach the abyss of embarrassment by gordon browns embrace of the sinister ploys of the ego centric ken livingstone who has been the main tout for big business crossrail hole plot the pitfalls and the wastefulness of crossrail are being acknowledged by some of the most unlikely of quarters and sources including in a bizarrely twisted way by some within livingstones own empire for abuse of transport in the name of the people of london transport for london
2710005 identification of the problems that crossrail will cause represents a broader view of the problems than the promoters of the current plan will claim it is time to go back to the drawing boards and come up with the plan that will be economically and environmentally sustainable a great deal of public money has already been wasted in the bureaucracy of the crossrail company they have not produced the optimum solution to the transport needs of london the reason why they have not done so includes the sabotage of the parliamentary scrutiny of the crossrail bill in terms of the devastating effects the crossrail hole plan will cause to the east end of london the social deficits will far outweigh any promised economic benefits for these parts with the world of finance behaving in the unpredictable way that it is bound to do the promoters big claim for crossrail being vital to make london a world class financial centre will most likely be another wasteful and diversionary exaggeration scrap the crossrail bill now use sustainable economic solution to the transport needs of london
2710006 lamentablemente en estos d as no pudimos hacer casi nada para habilitar el estadio de oruro incluso ten amos el compromiso del presidente de la liga pero bueno no podemos hacer nada y s lo nos remitimos a jugar en donde est programado ayer me comuniqu con los dirigentes de real potos quienes estaban interesados en jugar en potos pero ellos realizaron un an lisis y determinaron no aceptar nuestra propuesta ellos dicen que no les es muy favorable jugar en un d a particular y en la noche lo que sin duda causa p rdida en la recaudaci n es por eso que jugaremos en la paz

2710008 est bamos preocupados por ese tema menos mal fue solucionado y no tendremos problemas en principio ten amos varias ofertas de jugar el mi rcoles otra de jugar fecha doble con strongest e ir al cincuenta por ciento de la recaudaci n pero decidimos jugar como est programado lo que significa que la recaudaci n al margen de los descuentos por ley es para el club

2710029 in the days when you carried your entire race fuel load on board the car there was a much bigger role for the driver in managing the tyres and brakes
2710030 you could decide to run non stop if you could make the tyres go the distance while someone else might pit twice
2710031 and because the cars weight changed so much more in the course of the race there were more fluctuations in performance and handling characteristics which in turn created more overtaking opportunities
2710032 these days in dry conditions you very rarely see anyone win from further back than the second row of the grid because race pace largely mirrors qualifying pace which is not surprising when the conditions are so similar

2710035 it was a high quality game it will be tough for the olyroos we have to be honest about that the players had a very good preparation they are physically fit and now they have to show it
2710036 it is most important for these players to get international experience
2710037 i am very pleased with all the games they have had to play and how they are growing as players
2710038 it will be tough but i am 100 per cent sure they will give everything to go to the next round im very interested to see how they play against a team like argentina
2710039 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2710040 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2710041 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2710042 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2710043 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2710044 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2710045 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2710046 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2710060 in the united states war related expenditures have constituted the dominant sector of the federal budget throughout our history omitting the years of the second world war and the post war period where the record is so well known a tabulation of federal expenditures by decade from 1800 to 1939 for army navy veterans compensations and pensions and interest on the debt prior to the new deal federal debt incurred was primarily a result of war spending shows that except for one decade at least 54 of federal expenditures were for military activities or preparations during the decade or to meet obligations arising from previous military activity the one exception was the decade of the great depression 1930 to 1939 when the percentage dropped to somewhat below 40 percent in seven of the fourteen decades the war related share of the federal budget was 70 or more

2710069 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2710070 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2710071 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high

2710079 in the past it was about being a proud sponsor of the olympics
2710080 sponsors can get a lot closer to the action by sponsoring the people who are talking about it
2710081 theres no way a traditional 30 second commercial could bring people together in this way
2710082 we felt we had a great fit with everything the olympics stands for
2710083 there are six traditional items not on the menus that can be requested from the kitchen on any given day
2710084 its okay honey its just the vacuum it wont hurt you
2710085 doggone it you are 6 years old and i have never gotten water in your eyes why do you always say that like you even know what its like to get water in your eyes
2710086 highly focused and enforced sanctions that target the regimes ability to maintain and acquire weapons of mass destruction
2710087 given that the price of oil have allowed states to invest heavily in weapons of mass destruction wmd the primary external of this development both economically and diplomatically has been russia
2710088 the depths to which weve come now marked by the convergence of terrorist islam and western elites represented at this moment by the democrat candidate for president of this country are such that we must be grateful it is horrifying to say that we were attacked by muslims
2710089 we are talking about mainly the mountain aquifer and the jordan river system regarding the first one israel exploits approximately 80 of the renewal water resources and the palestinians the remaining 20 regarding the jordan river system the palestinians do not have any access
2710090 the region contains two sets of countries each capable of drawing others to follow them depending on their success at one pole are the baathist dictatorships of syria and iraq when the possibility existed they were aligned with the soviet union against the west at the other pole are the israeli and turkish democracies allies of the u s through thick and thin on the sidelines egypt jordan and lebanon have swung to and fro
2710091 there is little doubt that were turkey and israel intent on restoring lebanon and distributing the areas water in a rational manner they would stand a chance of success a stable strategic grouping capable of deterring the militant baathist regimes in syria and iraq would promote the commencement of large scale regional water planning and grid systems since extensive water planning proposals will necessitate the establishment of pipelines and energy grids stretching across borders a political and military structure that can ensure the safety and security of the carriers will be the prerequisite to effective water sharing already turkey and israel have engaged in serious negotiations starting in may 2000 to import 50 billion cubic meters of fresh water from turkey using tanker ships but an effective regional system would require political military cooperation against syria
2710092 the european union and nato must take up the initiative and oppose the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe
2710093 that peacekeeping troops in south ossetia are only from russia is simply a farce
2710094 we are not planning to send any troops there but anything is possible
2710095 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2710096 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2710097 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty
2710098 sen mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
2710099 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2710100 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the soviet union invaded czechoslovakia that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
2710101 the fact that we have to deal with russia to deal with our most important national security challenges
2710102 the temperature of your rhetoric isnt a measure of your commitment to georgian sovereignty
2710103 you dont want to get so far in front of a situation that youre feeding the momentum of an escalation
2710104 mccain took an inflexible approach to addressing this issue by focusing heavily on one side without a pragmatic assessment of the situation
2710105 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2710106 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2710107 stemmed from a momentary misunderstanding as to the exact location of the u s mexican border
2710108 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2710109 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
2710110 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2710111 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2710112 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2710113 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2710114 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession to the extent that were getting that thats just great
2710115 what we need in this market is for the financial stocks to stabilize i think theyll stabilize well before the housing market fixes itself
2710116 this commodity pullback is very timely because i think it does take that stress point away from the market

2710119 here in a sporting context and theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete we have no reason to have any concerns on that
2710120 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2710121 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing

2710149 raising food that is healthy for consumers and animals does not harm the environment is humane for workers respects animals provides a fair wage to the farmer and supports and enhances rural communities
2710150 this whole globalized food system is playing havoc with the health of human beings the health of the planet the health of the atmosphere
2710151 we have to rein in industrialized globalized food systems and turn it back to the local rhythms of life

2710308 sab a que iba a necesitar una buena braza cuando giramos juntos en el muro
2710309 football memorabilia has increased in popularity over the past several years game used football jerseys of ones favorite player is usually on the top of each collectors want list
2710310 since your items were only used in a practice scrimmage situation the value would be much less than that of a game used item your field jackets from the mid to late 1970s are worth 75 each a nice keepsake for any falcons fan
2710311 its a very current thing of course with the price of oil being as high as it is
2710312 you would hope that people are getting more aware because they want to be but its really the dollar
2710313 their pocketbook is being affected theres going to be some distressed people this winter trying to heat their houses
2710314 until people really embrace efficiency or try to get their use down theyre not going to save the money
2710315 people are concerned about unit cost right now because unit cost is something that they see something thats on the gas stations sign and so they think about how many units they use of energy their actual out of pocket costs
2710316 so if they drive less theyre going to use less gas and its going to cost them less if they insulate their house better theyre going to use less energy
2710317 i drove a cab in detroit but watkins glen worried me a lot more
2710318 a lot of these guys have no clue what theyre doing out there especially when they see a right turn
2710319 nascar drivers throughout the last couple years im going to go back even as far as 10 years theyve started to put a lot of effort into their road racing because its two of the 36 races
2710320 and if you run the nationwide car as well it could be four
2710321 so theres a lot of good road racers i mean mark martin has been a phenomenal road racer for as long as i can remember i teamed up with him in the late 80s we won the 24 hours of daytona together look at whats happened the last eight years in cup races its been a nascar regular thats won all these races
2710322 the biggest thing on the oval is you know back off early get it into the corner then get back on the gas
2710323 its similar to how i run the road races as well i try to roll the middle as fast as i can and i think you know thats helped me on the road courses
2710324 but you know the short ovals i normally run pretty good at so it seems like that works there too
2710325 its no secret that i really dont like road courses
2710326 watkins glen is a little faster and flatter than infineon raceway but i grew up watching racing on ovals and not road courses
2710327 ive had a good run or two at the glen and im running the nationwide race there saturday to get some extra seat time but i just generally dont like road course racing we just want to run well get through it and get on with oval track racing next week at michigan
2710328 even though ive had my share of ups and downs at the glen i still consider it my home track
2710329 i like everything about it the track the area the people the restaurants the saidhead fan club and seneca lodge
2710330 i had the fastest car that day and i know i could have won the race
2710331 but i got punted from behind by robby spun out and hit the fence that one is still hard to swallow
2710332 that stuff happens all the time all the time because thats in the heat of the moment its competitive theres sweat running down your forehead this is a decision making business that you have to do now not always are you going to make the right decisions and you never know what the right decision is until the whole thing unfolds
2710333 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2710334 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2710335 this time not so far almost like a trip to pittsburgh less than 200 miles in the middle of ohio
2710336 its called mount gilead state park a quiet small park centrally located in the state of ohio picnicking fishing and hiking can be enjoyed year round at this beautiful location as its website states but thats not why we come every year
2710337 its the expo of bike new and old my one favorite is the sidecar races i seem to always get there when its almost over or just doing time trials
2710338 hundreds of thousands come to see the sites and events
2710339 as of last year the indy race cars come to mid ohio they are something to see race and they are part of the summer of racing check the web page for the next time they have there races next year at and i have to say make reservations very early every hotel fills up
2710340 the last princess von metternich called this cellar the cathedral of riesling
2710341 tradition is not praying to the ashes it is handing over the fire
2710342 riesling is a dream but it is a marketing disaster

2710344 russian premier vladimir putin arrived in the capital of north ossetia and called georgias acts in south ossetia a species of
2710345 the actions of the georgian leadership in south ossetia are a crime and foremost they are a crime against their own people because a deadly blow has been delivered to the territorial integrity of georgia which brings massive damage to its national identity
2710346 its hard to imagine after all that had happened and after all that is still happening theyll be able to convince south ossetia to be part of georgia

2710376 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2710377 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2710378 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2710379 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2710380 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2710381 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2710382 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2710383 were still trying to reconcile the different things we do and cultivate what were individually good at into something thats bigger than the sum of its parts
2710384 when were all playing and its working it becomes this separate entity and thats still the thing that were chasing
2710385 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2710436 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore

2710442 i will go from this programme to urge my leader to declare loans if theyre not declared
2710443 the issue here is should loans be declared yes the point youre making is absolutely right the point about the declaration of loans and gifts is transparent so that people know who is donating to a political party and then theyre able to make a decision
2710444 the resignation of labours general secretary over the latest party funding scandal loses the last shred of credibility labour has over this issue
2710445 if they try now to limit pre election spending in order to reduce the conservatives ability to fight incumbent labour mps it will be the greatest constitutional scandal of the last 100 years

2710467 neither judy nor i have any desire to run budget hotels or do this project halfway
2710468 the revenues that can be generated at these properties can only support so much investment
2710469 so really the state investment is bridging the gap between say the historic hotel niagara continuing to operate as a travelodge based on what revenues can support versus a four star property that we can really hold out as a beacon of revitalization
2710470 we have a situation now in downtown niagara falls where we have a shortage of hotel rooms
2710471 if you want to compete with canada if you want to be a truly renowned destination you have to start with some basic infrastructure
2710472 one thing that should be pretty obvious is that if somebody cant get a room to stay we lose all other money
2710473 the hotel niagara was such a deteriorated building that it was going to cost a lot of money to bring it to the standards that the new owners want and what the marketplace is demanding
2710474 every tourist destination needs a mix of rooms for every type of traveler but for a long long time we didnt have what i would consider first class hotel rooms and thats where the deficit is and was
2710475 the fact that it takes taxpayer subsidies to assist in their renovation is just mind boggling
2710476 it just further reinforces some of the horrible spending practices that we have i just dont think that the return on investment is going to be there all its going to do is line up the next hotel near the casino who wants to renovate on the taxpayers dime
2710477 there will be a point where the market will reach a critical mass
2710478 there is a greater risk at the beginning than in the middle or the end i dont think that the message were sending is that this is an open ended opportunity
2710479 even though occupancy levels have increased year over year were still talking about low occupancy figures a good shot view of hotel 101 is that you have to run at least 50 percent occupancy to be profitable
2710480 if all the niagara falls hotels are running 54 to 55 percent then youve got quite a few of them that probably arent doing well
2710481 there can not be a more arrogant doc anywhere in any er

2710483 principala caracteristica a olimpismului antic ca de altfel ca si al celui modern este de a fi o religie sculptand corpul ca o statuie prin exercitii fizice atletul antic acorda respect zeilor facand acelasi lucru atletul modern isi onoreaza patria rasa drapelul

2710531 im happy we were able to release my online gaming book on time
2710532 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
2710533 this book speaks volumes about the impact of online gaming in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
2710534 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the online gaming industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
2710535 because the work that has been done in the online gaming literary area has been huge
2710536 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author ignacia gruenes who has pledged support for this system
2710537 i think cornelious urreas new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
2710538 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things
2710539 pre sale polls show this new online gaming book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
2710540 and i believe voltaire aragans book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
2710541 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
2710542 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
2710543 with the release of casa gammills new online gaming book were going to see record traffic levels
2710544 were releasing collison konyes work online in a weeks time
2710545 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
2710546 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers

2710549 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements

2710620 pues tengan por seguro que si yo tuviera autoridad las cosas ser an muy diferentes
2710621 nosotros los deportistas fuimos los que pusimos las herramientas para que se hiciera la investigaci n por lo que me desconcierta que se diga que la conade estaba investigando este caso desde el pasado mes de enero

2710637 the enemy agressor is always pursuing a course of larceny murder rapine and barbarism we are always moving forward with high mission a destiny imposed by the deity to regenerate our victims while incidentally capturing their markets to civilize savage and senile and paranoidal peoples while blundering accidentally into their oil wells or metal mines

2710639 one of the amusing by products of war is its pricking of the fundamental democratic delusion for years homo boobus stalks the earth vaingloriously flapping his wings over his god given rights his inalienable freedom his sublime equality to his masters then of a sudden he is thrust into a training camp and discovers that he is a slave after all that even his life is not his own

2710641 in 1938 for most of the men of our tribe the depression ended as mysteriously as it had begun the navy yard in brooklyn was hiring longshoremen again in great droves everybody knew this sudden good luck had its sinister side the navy yard was busy because the government was tooling up for another war roosevelt said he was not going to get us into the war he promised he would keep us out of the war my father said that woodrow wilson had made the same promises and then connived us into the first world war anyway

2710706 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
2710707 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
2710708 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
2710709 if we knew what it was we were doing it would not be called research would it
2710710 it is through science that we prove but through intuition that we discover
2710711 we are more ready to try the untried when what we do is inconsequential

2710713 the scythian soldier scrapes the scalp clean of flesh and softening it by rubbing between the hands uses it thenceforth as a napkin the scyth is proud of these scalps and hangs them from his bridle rein the greater the number of such napkins that a man can show the more highly is he esteemed among them many make themselves cloaks by sewing a quantity of these scalps together

2710729 were in danger of seeing the 2008 election stolen again as in 2000 and 2004
2710730 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
2710731 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution
2710732 weve witnessed in election after election how some states have used the winner take all formula to prevent the votes of political ethnic and other minorities from being counted
2710733 by refusing to challenge electoral college malapportionment in 2000 and 2004 which blocked democratic electors from voting in those elections the democratic partys leaders abandoned tens of thousands of their own voters just as they failed to challenge the election irregularities in florida and ohio in 2000 and 2004
2710734 will they fail to challenge malapportionment again in 2008 and hand the republicans another victory barack obama would not be the democratic nominee if not for the democratic partys proportional assignment of primary delegates the winner take all provisions in the general election present the distinct possibility that mr obama in 2008 will win the popular vote by a considerably larger margin than did gore in 2000 but will repeat the democratic loss in the electoral college
2710735 if proportional assignment is considered by democrats to be vital to democracy in their primary elections why wont they fight for it in the general election
2710736 the democratize the electoral college program exposes the hypocrisy and fraud behind charges that the mckinney campaign might spoil the democratic presidential tickets chances of winning democratic leaders should have to explain why they choose to ignore 13 additional electors from southern states that theyd gain through the green partys presidential electors project why is the green party fighting to give voice to democratic voters that the democratic party will not fight for let me be clear were not doing this to assist barack obama but to foster real democracy and voter participation and to offer cynthia mckinney as the truly democratic choice for all the people
2710737 americans dont vote for president instead we vote for an electoral college which was created in the late 1700s to expressly increase the power of the slave states and which it is still doing

2711206 that was his past i chose to not judge him but i did not know he was on a probation violation
2711207 weve all made mistakes everyone deserves a second chance everyone
2711208 i dont know the patric from the past the patric i know is the one now

2711221 investors overlooked more bad news from fannie mae as well as a below expectation estimate of u s productivity and focused instead on a huge leap in the u s dollar and the ongoing price of crude
2711222 oil and equity market direction from here will likely continue to have modest impact on the u s dollar though following sharp gains there would appear to be some downside profit taking risk for the greenback ahead of the close
2711223 decent gains in productivity are welcome news for the fed but this report shouldnt have much impact on the markets
2711224 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2711225 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2711226 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2711227 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2711228 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2711229 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2711230 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2711231 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2711232 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2711233 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2711234 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2711235 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2711236 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2711237 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2711238 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2711239 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2711240 we have moved several hundred cars into the denver area to accommodate expected demand from the convention
2711241 we are confident that we will be prepared to meet customer demand during the democratic national convention
2711242 it didnt make a lot of financial sense to go to the expense of trucking in the extra fleet for a few extra days
2711243 denver is set up in a way that people will be able to use public transportation and our official transportation system
2711244 i dont think the prices are high because there are no cars they are high because the companies can get it
2711245 it appears that the majority of the rental car companies have been bringing in extra cars
2711246 i guess they think there is going to be great demand for office space in downtown denver but we cant afford to pay that kind of rent
2711247 theres a lot of interest in buying the project because the rents have doubled in downtown
2711248 weve raised the rents because thats what tenants will pay for office and retail space downtown
2711249 i think its reasonable because of the location and the parking
2711250 there will be some rollover with those tenants facing renewals but there are tenants willing to come in and backfill that space
2711251 theres an opportunity to really upgrade that building and have it really be a nice boutique building
2711252 its been out of sight out of mind because its been very full but there are some tenants moving out and there are opportunities to grow rents and put some new tenants in there
2711253 we had a leasing agent who just thought we would pay the rate
2711254 im selling a discretionary product in a down economy and i have to be conservative
2711255 they dont want to deal with anybody theres no loyalty no nothing
2711256 there are a few good spaces and nothing great in the middle why would they want to lose good tenants while theyre working on their overall plan raising rents before creating image could be detrimental in the long run
2711257 we ran out of space and there was no adjacent space we could expand to
2711258 theres not a better office location but the retail has struggled for the entire time weve been here
2711259 the decision to sell the connecticut post was not an easy one
2711260 but medianews is now better positioned to weather the storm that surrounds our industry

2711263 i was attracted by the ability to avoid some of the usual costs such as private mortgage insurance
2711264 a lot of people have that reaction its too good to be true
2711265 the idea is to judge borrowers one case at a time taking into consideration that life happens
2711266 i was attracted by the ability to avoid some of the usual costs such as private mortgage insurance
2711267 there are some borrowers because of the hole theyve dug theres not a ladder long enough to get them out
2711268 the opportunity the dnc is going to provide is getting good business in the short term
2711269 and in the long term people will go back home and talk about denver and the activities they did here and maybe schedule their next family vacation to denver
2711270 its not quantifiable there are so many factors that influence tourism
2711271 but we have already had more press than the city has ever received
2711272 in the last year weve seen denver move to the top tier in convention destinations
2711273 its the same thing the olympics did for salt lake its top of mind it makes people more aware of the area
2711274 if unexpected events such as the riots that occurred during the 1968 dnc convention in chicago occur the city will have to spend that much more on infrastructure repair police etc which will reduce the multiplier effect
2711275 the bottom line was that because we did a pretty good job at the 2004 convention we got a bounce from it and the bounce is what we began to see in terms of booking larger conventions special events that boston hadnt held before and a spike in leisure visitors
2711276 your hotels are full of delegates but your hotels would have been pretty full anyway
2711277 people come to the convention center instead of the museum the mountains and other places so while these events have a large gross impact on the city the net impact is actually smaller
2711278 there is no doubt the dnc is going to bring 160 million to the city but there is no doubt that a huge amount of economic activity is not going to occur
2711279 its an exciting event for the city but denver should not expect the dnc to make them rich
2711280 the week before labor day is usually one of the slowest weeks of the summer
2711281 you can only fill hotels once so how can you do better than sold out
2711282 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes

2711307 es bueno estar con los iguales con las personas de tu propio sexo de tu propia edad o estudios con personas que tengan una igualdad a ti en cualquier par metro

2711325 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2711326 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2711327 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2711328 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2711329 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2711330 een antwerps ouderpaar heeft al hun zestien kinderen een naam gegeven die op een y eindigt maandag is het zestiende kind geboren dat de naam lovely kreeg het oudste kind heet wendy 23 ze is gevolgd door cindy jimmy brendy sonny sandy purdy chardy yorry yony britney yenty ruaby xanty pearly en sinds maandag dus lovely
2711331 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2711332 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2711333 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2711400 the average reading score was up 2 points since 2005 and 4 points compared to the first assessment 15 years ago
2711401 from the rural school and community trust analyzes the importance of rural education in each of the 50 states and calls attention to the urgency with which policymakers should address rural issues
2711402 what we believed from prior studies is that education has a significantly positive impact on racial attitudes
2711403 school choice and racial segregation in u s schools the role of parents education
2711404 what we found when studying behaviors however is that people acquiring more education is not a means of combating segregation education may broaden an individuals world but it also leads to greater negative sensitivity toward blacks presence in public schools
2711405 i do believe that white people are being sincere when they claim that racial inequality is not a good thing and that theyd like to see it eliminated
2711406 however they are caught in a social system in which their liberal attitudes about race arent reflected in their behavior
2711407 whites with higher levels of education still made school choices based on race while blacks did not
2711408 the more income african americans made the more likely their children attended more racially mixed schools than did african american children of less educated lower income parents
2711409 african american children of less educated lower income parents attend largely black schools
2711410 our study arrived at a very sad and profound conclusion
2711411 more formal education is not the answer to racial segregation in this country without a structure of laws requiring desegregation it appears that segregation will continue to breed segregation
2711412 divided by faith evangelical religion and the problem of race in america
2711413 united by faith a response to the problem of race in america
2711414 against all odds the struggle for racial integration in religious organizations

2711497 niagara college has clearly established itself as a leader in student satisfaction among ontario colleges
2711498 this remarkable achievement reflects the hard work of all faculty and staff and our organization wide commitment to the success of our students
2711499 this is a very proud day for the college and i thank and congratulate all of you
2711500 the kpi survey results also show that our students arent the only ones who are pleased with the work we are doing
2711501 more than 93 per cent of employers indicated they are satisfied with the graduates theyve hired and 81 per cent of our graduates said theyre satisfied with the education they received
2711502 the survey results also show that 91 per cent of our 2006 graduates were employed within six months of graduation
2711503 while we are proud of the results we plan to continue building on our success of putting students first and ensuring program quality and excellence
2711504 to that end the graduate rate results reinforce the need for us to focus our efforts and attention on student retention as we move forward
2711505 although we have made progress in the last year from 57 per cent to 60 6 per cent graduation rate clearly ensuring our students complete their programs of study and reach their academic goals is a main priority for us all
2711506 student retention will be the theme of this years day of reflection scheduled for may 3 at the niagara on the lake campus
2711507 i urge you faculty and staff to attend this event and join in an important discussion of how we can help our students succeed from day one to graduation
2711508 again thanks to each and every one of you who make niagara college no 1

2711529 overall i think its been a good week of practice
2711530 i think we have a lot of things to work on but i appreciate this group has energy they like football and theyre coachable in that we improved on some things we talked about from yesterday to today they protect the passer better our receivers are a little gimpy right now theyre a little tired and a little sore and they dropped some passes jairus byrd stood out to me today on defense he did a couple of great things that secondary as we talked about before is legit we still need to make sure were solid on that front seven in terms of our run defense
2711531 i thought jeremiah johnson has done a really nice job
2711532 i think hes running the ball very very well hes got a great sense and feel for this offense and so does andre crenshaw those two guys have stood out to me legarrette blount is getting by right now on a lot of power but he can be better
2711533 i think linebacker spencer paysinger is doing a nice job although hes a little bit hobbled right now on defense i love our secondary t j ward did a great job earlier today ripping and stripping the balls out and again he made a great hit on ed dickson in the scrimmage that actually scared me
2711534 i obviously want to see both sides dominate and flex their muscles and do some really good things
2711535 i thought the first team offense put together a really good drive early they were on the brink of scoring
2711536 overall our defense weve got some guys that are flying around really with great energy who are wanting to hit people and thats good
2711537 our first group on either side of the ball wasnt really sharp and
2711538 it is not the hours you put in but what you put in the hours

2711559 they got caught on ice on the roads even getting them out was a matter of anchoring the vehicle and letting gravity take its course there was some discussion as to whether people had damaged the road closure gates theyre certainly closed again now
2711560 a couple of families with young children were involved it makes it very difficult and our main concern is when we have vehicles and pedestrians on the road at the same time we have to put our volunteers at risk to get people out
2711561 on this council i supported mayor john davis in two mayoral votes and i didnt in two votes and that was over the issues at the time i parted with john davis two and a half years ago when he ignored my concerns about water its only in the last six months theyve acknowledged that we have an issue with water
2711562 we need to make sure things like the green suburb in south orange do go ahead

2711570 its simply a measure to placate noisy lobbyists that feel that this product even though its legal should be done away with altogether and its just not going to happen
2711571 you cant go to a total state of banning the product otherwise youll just drive it underground and that becomes just worse
2711572 the best thing is to manage this product through education
2711573 i looked up like holy smokes shes talking to me
2711574 i just wanted to tell you how sorry i am for the crossfire
2711575 my dad and i feel that you are the real winner
2711576 some people say the spirit of the games is just to participate
2711577 most of the men in my family were hunters i started hunting when i was 10 years old
2711578 when the ball is in my hands im capable of doing some great things
2711579 im willing to do anything to help this football team its a great team here a lot of great players im just the exception and trying to fit in
2711580 when he gets the ball in his hands he looks like he can do a lot of things he caught one pass did a spin move and spun away from some people it was electrifying for me because i know i cant do it so it was pretty cool to watch it
2711581 a great opportunity for me to get out there and get some balls from donovan and go with the rest of the guys and have some fun it was awesome just the environment it was great its a big opportunity for me to come into the nfl and play with a great team like this
2711582 just a fake reverse to catch the defense off guard a little bit
2711583 one of those kind of trick plays whatever i have to do to help this team out and be successful ill do
2711584 he did some nice things and hes got a couple of things he has to correct
2711585 he made some plays but he has to be a little sharper and crisper on a couple of things we did out there that goes for everybody you saw his hands and the way he can run routes he is very good at making moves
2711586 the biggest thing for me right now is experience the more experience i get the more comfortable ill be and the better i will do it i just keep working hard
2711587 in college the return is there you get a little more time to get off its there i can adjust to it its no big thing
2711588 i really think people got to see how much of an addition desean can be this year
2711589 desean played better than a lot of people expected he had that little hamstring issue in camp and you never got to see that go route where he exploded on people but the catches he made over the middle and the patience he showed for his first nfl game you got to be excited that guy is going to be used in a lot of different ways
2711590 youre tearing down our great country by suggesting we have problems

2711593 i like competing and i wanted to stay in and finish the game but sometimes your emotions get the best of you and you might do something irrational out there he thought i did thats part of the game its all patched up now though were buddies
2711594 i missed a month without being here with the team
2711595 and i wanted to try to prove myself again that i can pitch in the big leagues and i wanted to stay out there as long as i could he made the decision and thats his decision
2711596 he just wanted to stay in the game and i like that theres nothing wrong with that in fact if he didnt want to stay in the game id probably be mad
2711597 ill tell you something his confidence got back thats why i took him out of the game i wasnt going to let him lose the game he was leaving on a high note and theres four left handed hitters standing there i wasnt going to give him a chance to get hit he already pitched a good game and did a good job

2711599 there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2711600 we believe open discussions and dialogues on issues of religious conversions are imperative to find solutions
2711601 not allowed to hold open discussions in relation to our constitution and its laws then it makes a complete mockery of our legal system
2711602 our first goal was to get top three and advance and then it was to put as much heat on the other top crews as we could
2711603 it was a good start we have a lot to improve on and im looking forward to the semifinal
2711604 i feel like weve been sitting around the hotel it feels good to get going it was really good to get out there with karsten you know that her speed is on you can see what the speeds are on this course whats possible in this headwind it was good to get the experience on the course
2711605 and when he gets in the huddle and commands you cant measure that he becomes a different kid its not that he motivates by yelling he motivates by setting an example
2711606 i come to practice work out go to my bedroom do my homework and then go to bed
2711607 if thats what the media is looking for youre not going to get it
2711608 hell be very honest hell be very forthcoming and hell always talk about his teammates and not himself and thats not the way its been up at penn state the past couple of years which has been kind of concerning to me
2711609 he has enormous pride he has enormous pride for the program he told me last year when the off the field incidents were happening that he felt like he could do something to get to the guys and help them
2711610 its always been a thing for me ever since pee wee football
2711611 that once you get on the field something happens that totally changes the person
2711612 he needs to do the little things and work harder than everybody
2711613 i went to penn state and coach joe paterno has been there for a long time i dont have to say a whole lot more
2711614 he sits back there in the pocket and makes quick reads he throws on time hes niftier than a lot of people think he can get out of the pocket and move he just has that it that you cant coach
2711615 is clark going to transfer if he doesnt get the job no
2711616 theres a battle hopefully its going to be a fair competition with the winner winning and the backup being there when needed
2711617 sometimes you think things are going to be easy from the get go and theyre not
2711618 were playing against very good teams that have been together for a long time
2711619 i told him if the czechs came back and the u s lost this game id come and find him
2711620 it was awesome i know he had to leave early
2711621 its an honor that he came out and watched us perform and that he is a fan of the womens basketball
2711622 just to come out here tonight and see how many fans were supporting us and that our president was out here was good
2711623 we knew the mens team was going to come today
2711624 they were saying all day were going to come were going to come
2711625 we gained some confidence but know that the americans were at half strength
2711626 we have nothing to lose in this game all the pressure is on them
2711627 it happened so quickly it kind of came off a cross amy rodriguez tried to go for it and it came over her head and my eyes lit up i was at the top of the box and just made sure i hit a nice smooth stroke
2711628 i am very happy about our performance today against a very technical talented japan team
2711629 besides a great goal by carli lloyd i am very happy about our tactics
2711630 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2711631 we had a mantra today and it lit us on fire
2711632 we didnt hold back for one moment we competed like it was our last day
2711633 we are just praying he is ok because we really need him for the final
2711634 i havent seen him but others say he seems ok

2711636 getting them back was like making a big deal without losing anybody
2711637 in the past id have said a lot of guys would be gone but with them signing hanley to a long term deal it shows theyre willing to make an effort but i dont know who else theyd do that with nothing is for certain nobody knows who if anybody will be gone
2711638 right now weve put ourselves in a position to win the division and we cant worry about anything else
2711639 i got a strikeout on it a number of outs on it its probably not in the scouting report for them over there
2711640 so maybe what we see and what comes out is sometimes two different stories
2711641 im just going to move on ive already done that
2711642 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2711643 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2711644 i tried everything second seems to be my place what can i say
2711645 sok m ste kunna se andra v rden n medaljchanser
2711646 ska man fr ga urs kta r det d r verkligen din cykel
2711647 ibland blir inte allt som man har t nkt sig
2711648 das wird ein total anderes spiel auf einem v llig anderen niveau
2711649 als gro e mannschaft kannst du in solchen spielen nur verlieren im pokal passieren auf der ganzen welt immer wieder berraschungen
2711650 das war nicht gut wir waren unsicher haben zu schnell zu viele b lle verloren
2711651 es war ein au ergew hnliches spiel f r uns da laufen alle mehr als normal
2711652 beide m dels sind als totale au enseiterinnen angereist sie haben sich gut verkauft und gute leistungen gezeigt f r eine medaille h tten sie ber sich hinauswachsen m ssen
2711653 wof r romy gegen die japanerin bestraft wurde das hat am vortag die kubanerin gegen michaela gleich viermal gemacht und wurde nicht bestraft
2711654 what this power is i cannot say all i know is that it exists and it becomes available only when a man is in that state of mind in which he knows exactly what he wants and is fully determined not to quit until he finds it
2711655 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2711656 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2711657 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2711658 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2711659 theres no better way to return than for the olympics
2711660 it was important to us that shawn had a normal life
2711661 she wanted to go to public school chow was all for that
2711662 he makes a game of teaching a new skill and shawn likes the challenge
2711663 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2711664 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down
2711665 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2711666 of course i wanted to stay longer and help those guys more but 30 guys got away and we didnt have anybody there and i tried to react as quick as possible we were going fairly quick its better to shut a group out like that fairly quick
2711667 i kind of already knew what he had what he was going to bring
2711668 but i kept my composure and finished the rounds ahead on points and i did what i had to do
2711669 he asked how short i said id get back to him
2711670 la gmg 2011 a madrid un impegno per tutta la spagna
2711671 cos la laicit per il cristianesimo scoppola e benedetto xvi a confronto
2711672 il dialogo tra le culture e possibile anche se non facile
2711673 ai confini della terra nella continuit di una tradizione vitale
2711674 che possono degenerare in un conflitto di ancor pi vasta portata
2711675 sono motivo di profonda angustia le notizie sempre pi drammatiche dei tragici avvenimenti che si stanno verificando in georgia ha detto benedetto xvi a conclusione dellangelus recitato nella centrale piazza del duomo e che a partire dalla regione dellossezia meridionale gi hanno causato molte vittime innocenti e costretto un gran numero di civili a lasciare le proprie case
2711676 e mio vivo auspicio ha proseguito papa ratzinger che cessino immediatamente le azioni militari e che ci si astenga anche in nome della comune eredit cristiana da ulteriori confronti e ritorsioni violente che possono degenerare in un conflitto di ancor pi vasta portata si riprenda invece risolutamente il cammino del negoziato e del dialogo rispettoso e costruttivo ha chiesto benedetto xvi evitando cos ulteriori laceranti sofferenze a quelle care popolazioni
2711677 risolutamente il cammino del negoziato e del dialogo rispettoso e costruttivo
2711678 comunit internazionale e i paesi pi influenti nellattuale situazione a compiere ogni sforzo per sostenere e promuovere iniziative volte a raggiungere una soluzione pacifica e duratura in favore di una convivenza aperta e rispettosa
2711679 ci si astenga da ulteriori confronti e ritorsioni violente che possono degenerare in un conflitto di pi vasta portata
2711680 e mio vivo auspicio che cessino immediatamente le azioni militari e che ci si astenga anche in nome della comune eredit cristiana da ulteriori confronti e ritorsioni violente che possono degenerare in un conflitto di ancora pi vasta portata
2711681 risolutamente il cammino del negoziato e del dialogo rispettoso e costruttivo
2711682 when you have a program you have young players that maybe are known about during recruiting but then you dont hear from them for a year or two
2711683 just because you dont hear from them doesnt mean theyre not getting better and better all those people are in place and now theyre just waiting their turn
2711684 were getting there are we there at every position not quite yet but i look at some of the competitions on the practice field and were getting closer
2711685 we cant live up to what ray rice did we just want to make names for ourselves
2711686 were having our running backs be a part of this offense weve got four guys that can play football
2711687 our work ethic is definitely good we come to the ballpark with the idea that our guys like to play
2711688 when we dont score runs it means were not hitting with guys in scoring position
2711689 every day is a wanting to win deal putting 100 percent in everything about it theres no slack period or things like that but if you put forth the effort and you dont score runs i dont know i dont have the answer for that
2711690 we get to 3 2 and we chase a ball instead of taking ball four we dont execute or we have trouble executing i dont know what to do about it you can say well youve got to do something about it well what everything about it is attitude baseball is an attitude thing youve got to bring it every day
2711691 the reason is because i think ruiz throws better and he blocks balls better coste is very good defensively hes not a bad defensive catcher but i like ruiz on lidge better
2711692 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2711693 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2711694 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2711695 they spend more hours daily in front of a screen than they do in a classroom in a given year
2711696 decreasing screen time will not automatically increase physical activity levels
2711697 the tricky part is that children today need to be using computers
2711698 as little as 30 minutes a day although not ideal can really do wonderful things for a child
2711699 an obese youth is very likely to become an obese adult

2711738 while the long term economic impacts of the olympic games are likely to be minimal it increasingly looks like the games short term economic impacts are likely to be negative

2711740 our estimates for china put the impact of the 2008 olympics far behind the decimal point in terms of growth

2711783 georgian forces have temporarily left tskhinvali as part of a tactical manoeuvre they are in positions on the outskirts of tskhinvali
2711784 there have been eyewitness reports that georgian troop columns have been moving out of tskhinvali and moving back into georgian territory
2711785 five people have been injured in what appears to be a russian air raid
2711786 when you speak to people here they have no idea why this place would be targeted while there are military parts housed here it is not a military base some say that perhaps there may have been confusion on the russian side
2711787 our navy sailors have been assigned the task of preventing arms and other military supplies from reaching georgia by sea

2711859 we sent him the script and we wanted him to play dale the role i ultimately played because we had written his role for me

2711883 we have these huge stories going on like the one youre reporting in georgia
2711884 not the stuff the american public wants to hear about in this election cycle
2711885 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2711886 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2711887 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2711888 the actions of the georgian leadership in south ossetia are a crime and foremost they are a crime against their own people because a deadly blow has been delivered to the territorial integrity of georgia which brings massive damage to its national identity
2711889 its hard to imagine after all that had happened and after all that is still happening theyll be able to convince south ossetia to be part of georgia
2711890 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people i think it would be correct if you instruct the military prosecutor to document all such incidents
2711891 in my opinion there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff and im one of them
2711892 and even with a good lab and staff to help run it it might take me a year to come up with a product as good
2711893 russia has shown itself capable of crossing every line in this conflict
2711894 we are willing to do cease fire immediately providing the other side stops to shoot and to bomb
2711895 its hard for us to understand what the russian plan is
2711896 people can argue back and forth over who shot first
2711897 if georgian officials request it we will facilitate the transfer within a relatively short amount of time
2711898 we have communicated with the russians what our obligations are
2711899 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2711900 va malissimo leconomia i ricchi quindi sono sempre pi ricchi
2711901 the idea is lets take all the things that we think are wrong with this business and try to change them
2711902 it really seemed to require a start up from scratch because it will be very experimental
2711903 at this moment of real volatility in the book business when we are all recognizing things that are difficult to contend with like growing advances and returns and that people are reading more online we want to give them information in any format that they want
2711904 im not cynical about it and im open to ideas but i think its too soon to say what the validity of it is these words seem fine and interesting but how does it benefit the author and how do we find our readers
2711905 we generally support the idea of looking at potential solutions to a return system that is not working well for the industry as a whole
2711906 just got a frantic call from a professor who got an advance copy of the forthcoming novel jewel of medina she said she found it incredibly offensive
2711907 upcoming book jewel of medina a new attempt to slander the prophet of islam
2711908 the writer withdraws this book from the stores and apologise all the muslims across the world
2711909 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
2711910 i dont have a problem with historical fiction i do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
2711911 that very evening we had arranged to see our architect who has been busy preparing some plans for redeveloping our building
2711912 it is quite extraordinary that on the day we were making steps towards redeveloping the site the oldest part of our building which would probably be the first part of any redevelopment caught fire

2711925 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinu nciare a tutto
2711926 e domani sar pi difficile ora sono assuefatto alla presenza costante del
2711927 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2711928 i think furious would be a good way to describe it she didnt understand we both went through a process of trying to figure out how it happened why it happened
2711929 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences
2711930 none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2711931 she was having some trouble she just wanted to talk
2711932 i wanted her not to tell the public what had happened
2711933 theyve been told every detail i think beyond the basics i think thats where it stops in terms of the public because i think everything else is within my family and those privacy boundaries out to be respected
2711934 i had nothing to do with any money being paid and no knowledge of any money being paid and if something was paid it wasnt being paid on my behalf
2711935 decided independently to help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2711936 i did this of my own volition without the instruction or suggestion of anyone and made a conscious decision not to tell anyone including john edwards that assistance was provided the assistance was offered and accepted without condition this is now and shall always remain a private matter between these individuals and me
2711937 it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what that picture is
2711938 do you know how many pictures have been taken of me holding children in the last three years i mean it happens all the time
2711939 are you saying you dont remember holding that child of miss hunter
2711940 im saying you asked me about that photograph i dont know anything about that photograph i dont know who that baby is i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2711941 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2711942 ive been in love with one woman for 31 years she is the finest human being i have ever known
2711943 i have seen these public figures who bring their wives along when they say theyve done something wrong confessing some wrong and the wife they bring their wives to stand beside them i guess to show support elizabeth didnt do anything wrong i didnt ask for her to be here i asked for her not to be here uh this is my responsibility my alone i have to be the man and take responsibility
2711944 and anybody anybody watching this broadcast or who hears about this who wants to beat me up for this they should have at it the truth is you cant possibly beat me up more than i have already beaten myself up
2711945 have you seen those signs saying speed kills i bet on one horse thats going to live forever
2711946 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2711947 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2711948 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2711949 there can be no dialogue with the georgian leadership they are criminals
2711950 i enjoy our conversations our relationship is constructive and its important and also very candid
2711951 i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
2711952 it just goes to show that god is universal god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2711953 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
2711954 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
2711955 he threw the ball away which is one of those situations that we talked about
2711956 he made a couple nice throws there on some back shoulder throws
2711957 they told us at the beginning of training camp this going to be a tough competition
2711958 it just got tougher now we have to compete against four guys not three
2711959 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2711960 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defense we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish
2711961 weve got to do a little better job of getting the defense off the field right now
2711962 we played a lot of guys and we played hard
2711963 he said hey this first match in the olympic games is what were gearing up for
2711964 obviously we wish he could be here even though we understand why hes not
2711965 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think we should be doing and having him say i dont think so rather than where i am right now
2711966 he doesnt know if or when hell be able to return to the team
2711967 en tot cas la ub com les altres universitats catalanes hauria de prestar especial atenci a aquest tema i millorar el web molt antic
2711968 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
2711969 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone
2711970 weve got culinary and bakery students people from our catering and management programs and the louisville and lexington campuses
2711971 all the athletes will have access to the cafeteria at the hptc
2711972 so the students might be cooking for lebron james or kobe bryant
2711973 i want to go everywhere i want to taste the craziest foods
2711974 this is such an irresponsible post its not being sensitive the philippines has been subject of criticism malign and ridicule this is adding insult to injury the philippines has been a breeding ground for pedophile and sick old foreign men who uses their money to lure poor people into prostitution marikina also has an image to uphold and not be insulted by this irresponsible remark from two caucasians they probably thought it was a joke but they did not think before they acted take this off from the blog demeaning and inappropriate
2711975 well come to your country and youll use us like cheap bitchy women from marikina
2711976 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2711977 kakak makasih ya saya pasti ingat kalau tas ini hadiah dari kakak
2711978 no sleeves means you dont have to pay for sleeves
2711979 kaulah yang membunuh kedua orangtuaku tapi kenapa kau datang mencariku
2711980 perpisahan ini bukanlah elegi namun sebuah gerbang pembuka hati dalam perjalanan suci menuju ilahi
2711981 akan menunggu adzab yang pasti dimana hari hari bukanlah mimpi yang tak bertepi melainkan gelap malam yang trus merajam diri
2711982 his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of her favourite story and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her
2711983 serious crimes included house breaking possession of stolen property and domestic violence
2711984 dia lycan tuan lihat taring taring di mulutnya itu dia bersiap untuk memangsa tuan kala dia terbebas dari sengatan matahari
2711985 turuti kataku dulu kalau bagiku dia jelas musuh aku takkan keberatan kalau kau memenggalnya
2711986 berarti sekarang jelas untukmu tuan lycan anda ceritakan saja dulu bagaimana bisa anda mendapatkan wujud ini
2711987 lantas apa maksudmu mengaku peramal ketika brunus bertemu denganmu kau menipu brunus
2711988 kalau kukatakan dengan jujur pada waktu itu apa kau akan mempercayainya setelah melihat wujud ini
2711989 tanpa tuan kara yang kupercaya adalah orang paling bijak yang kukenal kau pasti bernafsu untuk membunuhku apa dugaanku salah
2711990 sekarang aku ingin dengar ceritanya bagaimana semuanya jadi seperti sekarang
2711991 setelah aku keluar dari sarang dukun yang mengutukku itu aku tersadar bahwa aku masih berada di dalam hutan kutelusuri jalan mulanya aku bingung tetapi aku mulai teringat akan jalan yang pernah kulalui di hutan itu akhirnya aku sampai di tempat api unggun peristirahatan kami pada malam terakhir aku hanya melihat kain bekas sobekan dan gitar yang tergeletak di sekitar situ aku pikir kalau will brunus dan brand selamat tak mungkin gitar itu tertinggal tetapi mau kubawa juga untuk apa senarnya sudah putus papannya juga sudah hancur
2711992 karena kupikir tak ada yang bisa kulakukan akhirnya aku mengingat arahku dari tempat itu beruntung inderaku menajam dengan tubuh lycan ini jadi tidak lama kemudian aku keluar dari hutan itu dan bisa mencari jalan sendiri menuju kota ini tentu saja banyak rintangannya tidak sedikit orang yang takut setelah sekilas melihat wujudku beberapa petualang yang sinting sempat menantangku namun mereka terbirit birit setelah kalah
2711993 kau bukan orang pertama yang mengalami ini entah apa karena dukun itu lalai atau bagaimana dia telah memakai sihir barakh padamu sihir itu digunakan untuk memindahkan pribadi ke dalam raga lain yang dikehendaki si penyihir tumbalnyalah yang disebut bliath para penyihir kelas tinggi biasa menggunakannya untuk menaklukkan pengacau petarung sehebat apapun takkan berdaya apa apa jika dia terperangkap dalam tubuh seekor tikus yah itu salah satu contoh saja
2711994 kalau begitu apa aku beruntung atau sial karena telah dipindahkan ke dalam wujud jejadian seperti ini
2711995 fue una de las lluvias m s fuertes de la temporada
2711996 no corremos muy a menudo con lluvia como sta hab a irregularidades en el camino as es que enfrentamos varios sectores peligrosos pero es una prueba de ruta de eso se trata
2711997 y una de las cosas que m s me frustra es su arrogancia esta gente se piensa que somos est pidos
2711998 estamos en el negocio de la gimnasia y sabemos c mo se ve un ni o de 14 15 16 a os no hay que ser un entrenador de gimnasia para saber c mo lucen a los 16
2711999 esto es una cachetada tienen 12 14 a os m ximo
2712000 y las desfilan frente al mundo con el apoyo del gobierno
2712001 empeor desde que pusieron el l mite de edad la federaci n est huyendo del problema de la edad pusieron un l mite de edad y ahora no pueden controlarlo
2712002 i am not opposed to restrictions but 10 years is way too long to hold onto an investment
2712003 when the share price has run so fast and so hard you must be allowed to sell if people are allowed to trade their shares they can use the proceeds from the sale of those shares to cut their debt
2712004 sasol has not and cannot place any restrictions on the ultimate buyer of the shares after the initial lock in periods other than that the buyer should be black as defined in the prospectuses
2712005 in formulating a broad based deal we also had to ensure that investors can trade their shares and realise a return on their investment within a reasonable period of time
2712006 there is going to be pressure to sell once the lock ins are lifted and i think those shares are going to be mopped up by established bee players
2712007 wurde dem schuldner von einem gesellschafter ein gegenstand zum gebrauch oder zur aus bung berlassen so kann der aussonderungsanspruch w hrend der dauer des insolvenzverfahrens nicht geltend gemacht werden wenn der gegenstand f r die fortf hrung des unternehmens des schuldners von erheblicher bedeutung ist
2712008 protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens no matter where they are located
2712009 you know for any team to beat us they are going to have to play great
2712010 whatever kind of game we play theyre going to have to play great to beat us and thats a good thing and if we play great were going to be tough to beat
2712011 you know thats the one thing that i try to do everyday at practice and in games is to try to be vocal with our team and let them know where theyre at on the defensive end and the offensive end
2712012 its a global game thats just what its become and i think its beautiful as a purist of the game thats what you want to see have happen because you love the sport so much you want to share in that same enjoyment
2712013 our guys all want to play for the name on the front of the jersey their country
2712014 just like other countries have other high profile players playing also who are in the nba the nba is over 30 percent international so our guys have fit in well with that they want to play as one
2712015 well i think theyll show us tremendous respect and we will show them respect
2712016 obviously they would want their team to win its going to be an amazing game
2712017 the intent of this ordinance is to try to smear protesters and make them look as if they are somehow criminal or somehow going to engage in some kind of gross conduct
2712018 my mother came to me while i was being swung on a swing between two branches and got
2712019 i would think every restaurant in florida would be opposed to it
2712020 unless you have machines in the kitchen making your food the calorie count is not always going to be accurate
2712021 the rate of deaths caused by prescription drugs is over three times as high as the rate of deaths caused by all illicit drugs combined
2712022 we have not yet implemented a statewide monitoring plan that will help reduce the problem
2712023 as soon as i got pregnant the very first time i knew we were not having the baby in the hospital
2712024 i didnt want nurses i didnt know i didnt want to be confined to a hospital bed with an iv i didnt want to have my baby taken away for hours for tests
2712025 if a midwife has delivered 100 babies how can that midwife be prepared to handle it
2712026 they know they have options women dont want to be just a number
2712027 they tried to talk us out of it saying how dangerous it could be
2712028 i dont think they were convinced until they saw the birth
2712029 the truly independent community hospital is becoming an endangered species because of costs
2712030 its been debated for years whether these partnerships with larger hospitals are good for the local community but the trend is going on nationally and it is expanding
2712031 believes this local control option for hospital management allows the hospital to address the needs expressed by the local community while receiving from quorom the strategic financial and operational direction to be successful
2712032 have become more powerful increasingly mandating that the length of inpatient hospital stays be minimized and that procedures be performed in the most cost effective settings which are often outside the traditional inpatient hospital setting
2712033 youre going to want to be cared for where your family is close at hand
2712034 we do compensate by having arrangements with baptist hospital for cases we cant handle locally
2712035 but we know that community hospitals can be competitive in this day and age with the right mix of physicians staff and operations
2712036 you need to keep it modern and you need to keep surgeons and physicians
2712037 surgery is one of the few things that a hospital can do well and do well for their community so surgery is actually a strength the hospitals that have problems in all kinds of areas have lost their surgical volume
2712038 we have a great general surgeon who is capable of doing a lot
2712039 but there are specialties such as orthopedics neurology and cardiac surgery which are not done here so patients have to go off the mountain to get those services
2712040 certain surgeries will never be done here others can be done here but they dont generate the volume that could sustain a full time position in those cases we try to work with surrounding physicians to try to meet the need locally
2712041 more and more demand is being placed on systems for patient health records e prescribing requirements and tracking quality and price efficiency
2712042 private payers and medicare are going to require much greater sophistication in tracking patient care and these systems are very scalable for the larger hospital system
2712043 alliant provides more resources to hugh chatham than it could have accessed on its own
2712044 but having a board of directors and a medical staff that is engaged in the local community and a community that is supportive of the hospitals is the key to maintaining independence
2712045 enables us to maintain a consistent culture throughout the system as well as set up our own physician network
2712046 most everyone is lining up with one of the larger local health care systems which is understandable
2712047 its becoming more challenging for the independent hospitals to have access to capital to keep their facilities updated buy new equipment and afford the increasing costs of employees
2712048 the recruitment of physicians nurses and therapists is getting fierce
2712049 some hospitals try to handle that by creating partnerships with hospitals that also have major medical schools such as baptist
2712050 seventy percent of our patient care originated outside forsyth county substantially because were a level one trauma center for the region
2712051 we certainly welcome opportunities to explore management options where it makes sense for both hospitals but we also believe it makes good sense to have thriving hospitals in local communities where we can complement them with specialized care and training expertise
2712052 it will be very difficult to remain an independent entity in the face of the changing health care landscape

2712103 we have communicated with the russians what our obligations are
2712104 were not talking about anything beyond international diplomacy at this point
2712105 focus into getting our response thought through and then send an envoy into the mediation phase
2712106 its a very localized conflict that appears aimed at threatening the democratic experiment in georgia
2712107 many speculate that part of the reason for the use of disproportionate force is because russia doesnt want to see georgia moving toward nato
2712108 those are some pretty powerful words that are not helping us to end the violence

2712140 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2712141 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2712142 here in a sporting context and theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete we have no reason to have any concerns on that
2712143 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2712144 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing

2712151 nicole has just secured team gbs first medal and what a medal
2712152 there has been a lot of comment today regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2712153 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2712154 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2712155 i spoke with kaka yesterday saturday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2712156 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2712157 weve a few injury niggles at the back and i am looking for some experienced cover
2712158 ben is steady but he has a couple of clubs interested in him and i will have to have a think about it

2712175 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2712176 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2712177 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2712178 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2712179 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2712180 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
2712181 is part of the politics of the past that we have to move beyond
2712182 i went through that once and im not going to do it again if anybody says im a racist im not going to stand for that
2712183 i would rather lose a war to win a political campaign that is patently offensive when his campaign ran an ad suggesting that i had refused to visit wounded troops because i couldnt have tv cameras with me reporters immediately said that was patently false im not going to sit back and let my record be distorted
2712184 offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas
2712185 will allow people to see sen mccain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because youre standing there face to face
2712186 when you have to stand on a stage with your opponent as ive done in other campaigns you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship when you have to spend time with somebody i think it changes the equation
2712187 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances sen mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that
2712188 we responded with an offer of doing five debates rather than the traditional three which the mccain campaign declined
2712189 is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for sen mccain and myself to make our best case to the american people at a time when the american people will be paying attention
2712190 and ultimately the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the american people who are not interested in a lot of bickering but are interested in whos got the best answers for the country
2712191 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2712192 the goal was really to try to have authors helping each other get more exposure the idea was partly based on the 60s music festivals the monterey pop festival made big stars out of the then little known jimi hendrix janis joplin and otis redding none of them could have pulled in the crowd that they pulled in together but having them all on the same bill allowed people who many never have heard of most of them to experience their music i dont know if we have the equivalent of otis redding in this collection but you never know every time nikki andrews tells someone about the book shes helping to support the career of amber marshall every time amber tells someone about the book shes helping to expose jonathan wood to new fans
2712193 my partner pat lapree and i spent a lot of time going through each of the stories that were submitted
2712194 the manicure i think this collection really provides something for everyone

2712198 if there are three publishers including a small independent that gets maybe 20 percent of the usage most businesses are going to want to have access to that 20 percent
2712199 they delivered two to the house across the street and its been vacant since last october

2712204 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2712205 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2712206 sixty percent of our people are the working poor so they do have jobs however with the cost of energy and food they have to make a decision
2712207 we are up about 30 percent versus last year in distribution yet inventory has been down about 30 percent the increased demand and resources is a tough scale to balance
2712208 were sending out 15 000 pounds a day typically keeping up with the demand is a challenge for us and the demand is not just the seacoast area its national across the country we hear it every day
2712209 food we thought would last is gone that is off the scale for us it doesnt look like its going back to normal very soon
2712210 we had five families in desperate need just this past week
2712211 there is no major holiday no kids in school to come up with drives and the civic organizations that help us during the summer are not active and so we are forgotten
2712212 its been a three year trend weve noticed and it continues to get worse
2712213 we are really trying to take a proactive stance and offer more outreach programs nutrition education for families on a budget and sending home backpacks with food and nutritional information to needy children on weekends we are really trying to look at other ways to reach people
2712214 were down at the food pantry not having what were needing
2712215 the fbi documents based on surveillance of ivins said he visited a public library in frederick that evening
2712216 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2712217 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2712218 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2712219 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2712220 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2712221 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2712222 we are an after school enrichment and summer program of intentional engaging activities
2712223 we bus from portsmouth middle school but any kids are welcome here we are a free program so any help is welcomed
2712224 we offer a wide range of things we do big trips there are arts and adventure trips we have sports programs a new media program and a newspaper any child who comes here gets matched up with a mentor the kids love our programs and come for the same one week in and week out
2712225 we raised about 40 000 last year and most of our sponsors are returning this year
2712226 we get that income stream into the hands of new heights its a tough climate for charities but we seem to be holding our own of all the charity tournaments where else can you have a lobster lunch and hit a few balls by the atlantic
2712227 quotes from players big pictures i read about teams coming in from manchester and then boston and would come down and watch man there were some players
2712228 it was him and his brother former nfl offensive lineman justin cross and rodney mcquate on the same team they were monstrous we used to rise to the occasion against them mainly because of the nba connection
2712229 theyd bring 30 or 40 people with them with coolers the hill next to the court would be packed with people with lawn chairs
2712230 all kinds of people in manchester looked forward to coming to the games with us mostly so that we could all go out in portsmouth afterwards
2712231 the league used to start on market square day that was the kick off to our summers that really was the fun of the league the camaraderie and the portsmouth scene
2712232 and the biggest highlight for us was sitting on the hill after games watching the next games and getting into our coolers

2712237 its going to be a lot of fun these are the moments that you can tell your kids and your grandkids about daddy played in that game or daddy played in the olympics the atmosphere is going to be electric its going to be intense
2712238 it will be an honor to meet him and i look forward to him supporting us
2712239 once we get on the court though we dont think about those things were just going to play basketball but we respect the fact that hes going to come support us and be there for us
2712240 coach mike krzyzewski has said shoot the basketball if im open im going to shoot it
2712241 obviously i play a different role on my nba team try to do a little bit of everything but here i think im going to be called upon to shoot the basketball if im open
2712242 and with this team i mean ive never seen so many wide open looks
2712243 we won the bronze medal in 04 in 06 at the fiba world championships we didnt win the gold medal either so who are we to overlook anybody

2712246 we havent fully recovered from a natural disaster and now were again being battered by a man made calamity
2712247 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2712248 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2712249 i dont know i guess i just never started using the abbreviations so im used to typing things out
2712250 also everyone understands words but everyone might not understand the abbreviations
2712251 also the website didnt say when the winners would be notified and i assumed that they would tell me immediately after if i was a winner
2712252 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2712253 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2712254 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2712255 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2712256 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2712257 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2712258 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2712259 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2712260 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2712261 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2712262 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2712263 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2712264 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2712265 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2712266 a call to action saving lives through nuclear weapons control and disarmament
2712267 it felt like someone had opened the door of a furnace behind you
2712268 weve got to get rid of these nuclear weapons before something terrible happens
2712269 both sides of the camp are talking about the need to reduce nuclear weapons
2712270 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2712271 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2712272 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2712273 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2712274 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2712275 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2712276 last friday august 8 the lady met with her lawyer u kyi win from 1 00 pm to 3 00 pm regarding her detention
2712277 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2712278 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2712279 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2712280 i get off the plane in hawaii today and the world is saying my management team said blah blah blah siiiiiiggghhhh i told the media you cant make up lies about me because i have a media outlet myself oh and sidebar i dont know if everyone has realized this yet but i dont do interviews if theres anything i wanna say ill say right here on my own blog

2712294 in peace i will both lie down and sleep for you alone o lord make me dwell in safety

2712421 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2712422 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope

2712427 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2712428 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2712429 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2712430 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2712431 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2712432 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2712433 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2712434 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2712435 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2712436 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2712437 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2712438 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2712439 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2712440 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2712441 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2712442 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2712443 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2712444 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2712445 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2712446 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country

2712453 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2712454 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2712455 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2712456 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2712457 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2712458 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2712459 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2712460 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2712461 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2712462 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2712463 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2712464 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2712465 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2712466 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2712467 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2712468 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2712469 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2712470 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2712471 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2712472 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2712473 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2712474 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2712475 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2712476 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2712477 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2712478 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2712479 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2712480 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2712481 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2712482 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2712483 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2712484 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2712485 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2712486 engkau selalu sengaja memilih busana yang sederhana agar kecantikanmu tidak karam dalam kemewahan aku selalu sengaja memilih bahasa yang bersahaja saja agar makna sajakku tidak lenyap di perangkap ungkapan
2712487 ketahuilah puisi harus jujur katanya meskipun harus bicara dengan bahasa asing bahasa yang hening atau yang paling bising puisi enggan menanggung rahasia

2712490 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2712491 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2712492 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2712493 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2712494 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2712495 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2712496 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2712497 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2712498 langit yang memaafkan semua kesedihan yang engkau ciptakan dari kematianku
2712499 seusai membaca neruda tiga melankolia dari tanda baca yang tidak fungsional hingga permainan bunyi akhir yang sampai pada taraf menjengkelkan
2712500 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2712501 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2712502 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2712503 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2712504 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2712505 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2712506 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2712507 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2712508 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2712509 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2712510 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2712511 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2712512 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2712513 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2712514 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2712515 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2712516 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2712517 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2712518 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2712519 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2712520 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2712521 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2712522 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2712523 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2712524 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2712525 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2712526 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2712527 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2712528 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2712529 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2712530 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2712531 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2712532 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2712533 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2712534 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2712535 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2712536 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work

2712540 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2712541 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2712542 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2712543 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2712544 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2712545 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2712546 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2712547 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2712548 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2712549 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2712550 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2712551 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2712552 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2712553 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2712554 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2712555 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2712556 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2712557 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2712558 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2712559 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2712560 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2712561 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2712562 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2712563 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2712564 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2712565 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2712566 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2712567 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2712568 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2712569 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2712570 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2712571 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2712572 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2712573 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2712574 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2712575 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2712576 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2712577 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2712578 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2712579 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2712580 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2712581 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2712582 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2712583 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2712584 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2712585 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2712586 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2712587 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2712588 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2712589 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2712590 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2712591 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2712592 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2712593 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2712594 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported
2712595 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2712596 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2712597 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2712598 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2712599 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2712600 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2712601 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2712602 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2712603 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2712604 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2712605 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2712606 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2712607 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2712608 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2712609 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2712610 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2712611 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2712612 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2712613 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2712614 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2712615 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2712616 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2712617 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2712618 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2712619 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2712620 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2712621 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2712622 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2712623 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2712624 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2712625 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2712626 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2712627 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2712628 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2712629 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2712630 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2712631 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2712632 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2712633 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2712634 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2712635 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2712636 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2712637 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2712638 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2712639 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2712640 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2712641 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2712642 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2712643 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2712644 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2712645 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2712646 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2712647 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2712648 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2712649 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2712650 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2712651 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2712652 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2712653 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2712654 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2712655 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2712656 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2712657 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2712658 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2712659 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2712660 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2712661 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2712662 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2712663 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2712664 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2712665 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2712666 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2712667 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2712668 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2712669 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2712670 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2712671 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2712672 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2712673 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2712674 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise

2712682 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2712683 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2712684 lebih baik hidup sebaik mungkin dari hari ke hari anak yang mengawini ibunya tidak perlu membuatmu takut banyak pria yang mengimpikannya demikian
2712685 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2712686 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2712687 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2712688 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2712689 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2712690 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2712691 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2712692 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2712693 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2712694 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2712695 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2712696 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2712697 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2712698 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2712699 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2712700 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2712701 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2712702 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2712703 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2712704 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2712705 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2712706 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2712707 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2712708 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2712709 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2712710 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2712711 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2712712 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2712713 what about obama do i find so appealing and what was it that made me start drinking the kool aide in the first place
2712714 you can vote for me and i will tell you the truth or you can vote for the other guy and hell lie to you and do whatever he wants and not allow the people to make an informed decision
2712715 building from the ground up again reinforcing the idea that the little guy is in charge and thus will be listened to
2712716 meeting at coffee shops and listening to the average joe again reinforcing the same idea
2712717 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2712718 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2712719 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2712720 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2712721 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2712722 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2712723 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2712724 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2712725 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2712726 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2712727 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2712728 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2712729 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2712730 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2712731 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2712732 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2712733 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2712734 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

2712744 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2712745 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2712746 here in a sporting context and theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete we have no reason to have any concerns on that
2712747 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2712748 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2712749 from further confrontations and violent retaliations that could degenerate into a wider conflict
2712750 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2712751 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2712752 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2712753 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2712754 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2712755 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2712756 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2712757 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is very necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start

2712777 western society has given itself the organization best suited to its purposes based i would say on the letter of the law the limits of human rights and righteousness are determined by a system of laws such limits are very broad people in the west have acquired considerable skill in using interpreting and manipulating law even though laws tend to be too complicated for an average person to understand without the help of an expert any conflict is solved according to the letter of the law and this is considered to be the supreme solution if one is right from a legal point of view nothing more is required nobody may mention that one could still not be entirely right and urge self restraint a willingness to renounce such legal rights sacrifice and selfless risk it would sound simply absurd one almost never sees voluntary self restraint i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities the letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relations there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity paralyzing mans noblest impulses and it will be simply impossible to stand through the trials of this threatening century with only the support of a legalistic structure
2712778 we have finally at last and at least risen to the level of doing things as a central church legally
2712779 dada la enorme influencia que el stalinismo tuvo en el gobierno y en la persona misma de c rdenas
2712780 el consentimiento de c rdenas y de franklin roosevelt en el asesinato de le n trotsky debe considerarse como complicidad
2712781 porque era evidente que la t ctica preconizada por trotsky se hallaba en abierta pugna con la alianza del proletariado y otros sectores del pueblo de m xico con el gobierno del presidente c rdenas

2712783 red steel 2 has been in development for many months now and this new device will help us be even more precise in what we do with the product
2712784 the red steel brand is strong i think we released it on year one and that people understood that it was a first try on new technology technology that wasnt completely finished and our game tried to grab the best out of it and was a bit rushed to be sure to offer something in year one to wii consumers
2712785 so red steel is a brand and as with every brand we have we now have to reach the top quality possible what was missing was the preciseness of the sabre and with this new device i think it will change the experience
2712786 when you make a great game you need more than one year of development
2712787 a lot of games are made in less than a year but theyre not great products and theyre not selling at all so it takes some time to develop good games this year were coming with shaun white which weve developed over 18 months and the same for rayman 3
2712788 i think these two games can be in the top ten of the wii charts at christmas again and there will also be new wii games announced soon more games dedicated to capturing this new audience

2712854 a pr pria noguchi n o quer abdicar da sua participa o at o ltimo momento
2712855 n o levaremos o time titular para este jogo em curitiba n o pela prepara o para o jogo contra o gr mio mas por uma op o do clube de tentar revelar algum jogador precisamos pensar no futuro
2712856 vamos apostar nos garotos temos de arriscar um pouco at porque n o podemos colocar toda a responsabilidade sobre os mais novos mas vamos buscar bons jogadores e testar pois certamente vai aparecer algu m
2712857 acho a competi o importante mas para esta partida j conversei com o muricy e n o vou pra curitiba uma semana de treinamento importante para mim e os outros goleiros poder o pegar tamb m ritmo de jogo
2712858 vou ser reavaliado no vesti rio para saber se vai dar para jogar ou n o se for preciso eu vou no sacrif cio para ajudar o n utico n o posso mais ficar do lado de fora
2712859 o campeonato rec m est na metade e o inter tem condi es de brigar pelas primeiras posi es
2712860 claro que estamos devendo para a nossa torcida com tr s jogos seguidos sem vit ria e temos que buscar pontos fora de casa para conseguir a recupera o
2712861 no primeiro tempo o pessoal estava muito ansioso isso uma coisa que n o deveria ter acontecido a fran a abriu vantagem e a ficou dif cil recuperar
2712862 precisamos atuar com aquela pegada desde o in cio temos que acreditar mais na gente e chutar mais a gol tamb m o gol s sai se a gente chutar
2712863 fiquei um pouco decepcionado pela prepara o que tivemos acreditava que far amos um jogo melhor participamos de torneios campeonatos preparat rios e o time se saiu bem
2712864 no primeiro tempo perdemos muitas bolas e proporcionamos o contra ataque aos franceses no segundo equilibramos a partida
2712865 o sport novamente come a a jogar um grande futebol ap s a conquista merecida da copa do brasil sempre uma equipe dif cil de jogar muito forte fisicamente e que tem muita velocidade nos seus atacantes
2712866 essa repeti o na escala o muito importante sempre que for poss vel eu vou fazer mas muitas vezes dif cil por conta de cart es e contus es
2712867 fiquei muito feliz com esse primeiro gol que estava demorando para sair costumava fazer mais nos outros times onde joguei mas estava na hora de acontecer aqui e veio no momento certo
2712868 desde que cheguei aqui o muricy me deu muita confian a para jogar em v rias partes do campo mas o mais importante que estou podendo ajudar o s o paulo
2712869 como estava de longe e n o dava para o rog rio bater falei para o jorge wagner deixa essa para mim
2712870 o time jogou bem contra o s o paulo e n o h motivos para grandes mudan as nesse momento a melhor forma o que podemos usar
2712871 n o tem nada disso assim como o ipatinga n o pode ser apontado como um dos times rebaixados ainda ser o disputados muitos jogos eles ainda est o vivos e s o perigosos
2712872 isso pode acontecer mas complicado o mais importante fazer o nosso papel e vencer o jogo depois vamos ver os outros resultados n o podemos apenas nos preocupar com os nossos advers rios
2712873 precisamos da vit ria para seguir perto dos primeiros colocados sabemos que vamos enfrentar um advers rio forte e que est entre os melhores do campeonato mas temos condi o de vencer
2712874 o nosso objetivo n o deixar as equipes da frente se distanciarem o palmeiras subiu de produ o apresentou um futebol convincente nas ltimas rodadas
2712875 quando ganhamos fora e tivemos uma seq ncia de vit rias subimos na tabela se a gente conseguir melhorar o retrospecto fora vai brigar pelo t tulo
2712876 os dois est o bem e dando conta do recado

2712889 la rep blica no era una democracia se mataban monjas
2712890 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2712891 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2712892 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2712893 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2712894 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2712895 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2712896 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2712897 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2712898 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2712899 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2712900 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2712901 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2712902 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2712903 the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
2712904 an emphasis on universal as opposed to race specific programs isnt just good policy
2712905 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
2712906 so many of the disparities that exist in the african american community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow
2712907 the problems of inner city poverty arise from our failure to face up to an often tragic past
2712908 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2712909 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us
2712910 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2712911 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2712912 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2712913 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2712914 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2712915 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2712916 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2712917 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2712918 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2712919 in order to consider withdrawal of our forces we must make sure that there is no chance of genocide there
2712920 there is a straightforward way to stop fighting to stop killing for georgians to withdraw and then to have an agreement on non use of force signed and then we can talk on other verity things including on military and political arrangements
2712921 certain georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia
2712922 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2712923 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2712924 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2712925 maybe it will be quiet in the future im an optimist
2712926 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2712927 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2712928 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2712929 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2712930 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2712931 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2712932 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2712933 georgias actions are criminal whereas russias actions are absolutely legitimate
2712934 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are obviously a crime it is a crime against its own people first and foremost
2712935 a deadly blow has been struck on the territorial integrity of georgia itself which implies huge damage to its state structure
2712936 the aggression has resulted in numerous victims including those among civilians and has virtually led to a humanitarian catastrophe
2712937 time will pass and the people of georgia will give their objective estimations to the actions of the incumbent administration
2712938 it is based on an attempt of the georgian administration to get other countries involved in its bloody affairs
2712939 in accordance with international agreements including the agreement of 1999 russia does not only execute peacemaking functions but is obliged in case one party breaks the cease fire agreement to defend the other party which is exactly what we are doing in case with south ossetia
2712940 we perfectly realize what world we live in today we will strive for fair and peaceful solutions of all conflicting situations which we inherited from the past
2712941 germany supports zionist desires to attack iran and save the world from iranian nukes and oh by the way germany is so very sorry for the holohoax holocaust
2712942 the imam said this regime occupying jerusalem must vanish from the page of time

2712947 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2712948 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2712949 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is in a state of total military aggression
2712950 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2712951 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2712952 we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi to leave iraq today tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2712953 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2712954 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now

2713109 foi quando o jornalismo noticioso como conhecemos hoje foi inaugurado no brasil at ent o os peri dicos eram essencialmente opinativos o telegrafo diminuiu as dist ncias e permitiu a cobertura de fatos

2713112 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2713113 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2713114 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal she said
2713115 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september macquarie bank senior economist brian redican said
2713116 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october mr redican said

2713118 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2713119 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2713120 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2713121 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2713122 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2713123 mein v gelchen ich komm zu dir flieg blo nicht weg du bist nur mir
2713124 can shine or they can look to be out of touch or inconsiderate of the suffering of others
2713125 one of the other ways they can show they care is with the taxpayers checkbook theyre quick to open it especially when it gets into the papers or cable news
2713126 as far as the politics go certainly as the president found out there are good ways to handle disasters and bad ways to handle disasters
2713127 which suggests that presidents are trying to keep citizens happy in the years they are running for re election
2713128 the general sense is that you cant peg any particular weather event to climate change but everything were seeing is consistent with what the models predict
2713129 what were able to do today is to take a look at some events and to see if they would have occurred either as frequently or as extreme if it werent for human changes to the atmospheric composition
2713130 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2713131 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2713132 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2713146 i dont want to ever be taught about life as a rancher in oklahoma
2713147 this season proved that the show wasnt a one trick pony and that its characters were far more realized and versatile than those you tend to find in situation comedies
2713148 yeah the bad stale family sitcom with tired rhythms forced laughs and bogus characters is dead thank goodness but the genre perseveres
2713149 thanks to youtube fans nobodys watching may return from the dead
2713150 its such a deal for an inside showbiz peek tv show tapings are hard to beat and your only investment is time

2713153 it feels as if id put on an armani tuxedo tied my tie snapped on my cufflings and the last thing i do before i leave the house is spray cheez whiz all over myself
2713154 you wouldnt have a show without the writing story characters etc
2713155 explain how various production processes influence the content of television stories
2713156 bill lawrence garrett donovan and neil goldman thought that most traditional sitcoms had begun failing not because of form but because of quality they were all bad
2713157 however since the content is great its production process just compliments it
2713158 what could possibly be so hard about writing for television
2713159 flop on television are seen by many more people than bad art or film
2713160 american television teen drama based on the popular novel series of the same name written by cecily von ziegesar gossip girl revolves around the lives of socialite young adults growing up on new yorks upper east side who attend elite academic institutions while dealing with sex drugs and other teenage issues

2713164 sonys 24p cinealta production format stars in 2002 2003 television season
2713165 the thing about the single camera stuff is it allows the audience to feel like theyre in the scene with the performer its more intimate youre able to get into almost their real environment where as the multicamera stuff youre forced to play that proscenium if you will so everythings kind of long lens everythings compressed and you feel like youre watching it from the outside
2713166 marshall herskovitz and edward zwick who have made films like

2713172 thousands of videos of all levels of quality are posted everyday
2713173 it doesnt matter whats on the inside looks are whats important
2713174 not smart enough to understand the new breed of sitcom
2713175 that audiences when they find a show thats well executed and funny embrace in huge numbers
2713176 come off as smarter and hipper whether they are or not
2713177 that the next comedy to really make it big will be one that bucks that trend and is really a well written multi camera sitcom
2713178 single camera captivates nets earls success in crop of comedy pilots
2713179 its very much a post reality show sitcom capitalizing on the influence of the fledging genre and translating its conventions into a new kind of comedy
2713180 even blockbusters like er and west wing dont get the syndication numbers seinfeld raymond or even mash does levine article
2713181 the reality is that in 10 years you may be writing for a venue that hasnt been invented yet but in some form theyre always going to need comedy
2713182 its very much a post reality show sitcom capitalizing on the influence of the fledging genre and translating its conventions into a new kind of comedy
2713183 viewers should be able to watch any episode in a series and understand what is going on without any prior knowledge of characters or plots
2713184 networks want to lure young viewers what are preteens watching hannah montana and other sitcoms on the disney channel and not just sitcoms old school retro multi camera cheaply produced sitcoms tomorrows network audience sure doesnt think the form is dead
2713185 harder than trying to sell buggy whips in the age of the automobile
2713186 in ten years you may be writing for a venue that hasnt been invented yet
2713187 the stale family sitcom with tired rhythms forced laughs and bogus characters may be dead
2713188 how incredulous how dare he that was pretty amusing though
2713189 networks wants to lure young viewers what are pre teens watching hannah montana and other sitcoms on the disney channel and not just sitcoms old school retro multi camera cheaply produced sitcoms
2713190 you know that television goes in cycles there may never be the glut of sitcoms that we had in the past but they will survive and rebound in popularity the genre perseveres
2713191 as long as we have television we will have a sitcom
2713192 the sitcom genre is not dead it is just napping

2713208 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world and having the government back them
2713209 the only situation is to lift up the age limit it would be an even playing field for everyone

2713305 you should eat onam sadhya even if you have to sell your property
2713306 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2713307 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2713308 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2713309 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2713310 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles

2713320 la cesta de la compra ha incrementado su precio nada menos que en un 64 por ciento respecto al mes pasado y esto no hay econom a que lo digiera
2713321 no en vano 50 de los 60 alimentos que estudia el ministerio de industria turismo y comercio han elevado su precio durante el pasado mes dejando a los consumidores absolutamente indefensos ante una situaci n que est completamente desbocada
2713322 es necesario que el gobierno de espa a vuelva de vacaciones y nos aclare cu les son las causas que est n propiciando estas desorbitadas subidas pues no es posible a adi que dentro del sector alimenticio todos los eslabones se dediquen a culparse unos a otros mientras quien realmente deber a intervenir asiste al espect culo como quien presencia un partido de tenis

2713482 tem atleta s vezes que ganha r 1 mil ou r 500 por m s ele pode conseguir at dez vezes mais

2713484 um atleta que cobra um cach de r 5 mil para participar de um evento com a medalha ol mpica passa a cobrar r 50 mil r 40 mil
2713485 depende do carisma do atleta de como ele vai trabalhar a imagem dele depois
2713486 n s temos exemplos de atletas que ganharam medalhas de ouro e sumiram
2713487 de forma espont nea o atleta j ter uma grande valoriza o da imagem perante o mundo corporativo mas se tiver uma gest o eficiente de imagem pode capitalizar muito com a conquista
2713488 se voc pega um judoca que durante o ano s vezes tem uma bolsa atleta do governo de r 2 5 mil ele pode vir a ter um patroc nio de r 25 mil por m s ele vai multiplicar por dez o rendimento anual

2713490 o forte do produto s o os seis primeiros meses no m ximo um ano
2713491 dif cil ter uma m dia exata mas que um atleta capitaliza com uma medalha ainda mais ser for uma de ouro isso ineg vel pois as marcas querem associar sua imagem de um atleta vitorioso
2713492 impulsiona a carreira do atleta mas isso muito no curto prazo
2713493 tudo muito r pido no esporte a conquista ol mpica capitaliza a curto prazo sem d vida mas o atleta tem que enxergar que ele precisa se transformar num produto de marketing atrativo n o apenas em termos esportivos

2713495 there hasnt been an active community theater here since the demise of the asbury theater there needs to be an outlet for local talent local actors and playwrights
2713496 i spoke with gary gearing owner of the building about having a theater here and he was agreeable
2713497 we can do more productions we also can move the audience and the stage we can do theater in the round

2713511 come ou a n o ter mais na poca que as op es ficaram muito maiores
2713512 eles n o fazem desconto porque eu acabo comendo as massas e as saladas que est o no pacote
2713513 antes a gente servia pouca coisa na mesa comia se bastante carne justamente por isso procura dos vegetarianos n s optamos por colocar essa mesa de comida japonesa e incrementar o buf de salada
2713514 eu at prefiro porque tem muita op o em um restaurante s vezes n o tem tanta agora em churrascarias tem at op o de comida japonesa
2713515 eu me acho o melhor pai do mundo tenho um amor infinito por meus filhos e todos me adoram tudo o que eu fa o pensando neles n o d para nos encontrarmos sempre porque tenho filhos que moram no rio de janeiro em s o paulo e at no par mas a maioria est aqui e a gente se re ne sempre

2713523 cor o s mbolo da eleg ncia feminina na temporada
2713524 o branco uma cor sempre bem vinda no ver o mas nesta temporada ganha for a o look total aliado aos acess rios
2713525 quando iniciei o desenvolvimento da minha nova cole o pensei muito no branco e nas v rias tonalidades que se aproximam dele
2713526 assim surgiram algumas cores como o sunset color nude off white nevoa blanc casse todas derivadas do branco
2713527 o preto se tornou artif cio um pouco bvio na busca pela eleg ncia
2713528 o branco remete praia ao frescor celebra o sem deixar de ser uma cor cl ssica
2713529 o grande lance est em quebrar o branco total com detalhes metalizados usando acess rios de cores fortes como o rosa o pink uma faixa de cetim amarelo
2713530 o preto emagrece e o branco evidencia as curvas por isso h limita es
2713531 o branco pode ser conciliado com volumes para ter as propor es corretas respeitando as medidas de cada mulher
2713532 chronically ill and uninsured a national study of disease prevalence and access to care in u s adults
2713533 what i fear happening is these people who are uninsured are forced to rely on the emergency department and its a different kind of therapy specifically for emergencies
2713534 the ideal place to get medical care is from physicians whore familiar with your records and your past history thats not what the emergency room is designed to do
2713535 some claim that uninsured americans can get the care they need in emergency rooms but emergency rooms may provide too little too late for the millions of uninsured with chronic conditions they need regular medical monitoring and a steady supply of medications to control their illnesses and a whole array of services that are out of reach for the uninsured
2713536 most of the conditions are treatable and can be well controlled
2713537 there are a lot of people that have treatable medical conditions but they are locked out of having a quality standard of healthcare some plans for example require people to pay medical bills of 5 000 out of pocket before their insurance kicks in these plans put people in the precarious state of being underinsured which is not that much better than lacking health insurance altogether
2713538 we need some way of having non profit health insurance to get everyone insured
2713539 thats what were seeing most countries do you cant pretend theres some cheap and easy way to mandate healthcare
2713540 the rest of us have pigeons but white people keep

2713544 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2713545 the actions of the georgian leadership in south ossetia are a crime against their own people because a deadly blow has been delivered to the territorial integrity of georgia
2713546 its hard to imagine after all that had happened and after all that is still happening they will be able to convince south ossetia to be part of georgia
2713547 in my opinion they are already elements of genocide of the ossetian people i think it would be correct if you instruct the military prosecutor to document all such incidents

2713559 it is actually an inefficient expensive structure that is aging
2713560 usually there isnt any squawking about living in this unit
2713561 it serves better as an example of how we used to do our business than how we should be doing it now its not the correctional facility we should have in the 21st century
2713562 we want to prevent any layoffs and prevent any harm to the carson economy people signed on with the department to build a career and provide for their families
2713563 whoever you are from wherever you are how you are welcome
2713564 the thrust of this campaign was set months ago and is continuing forward theres no special plan to change that
2713565 were not here to watch what our competitors do were here to run our own race
2713566 were like latinos but we work with a swiss touch
2713567 madrid is a sure bet in all senses its a country that is open to all rights to all cultures
2713568 a fortune teller told me if i changed my name i would go far so i changed it because i wanted to go to the olympics

2713571 what happens outside the pool is no one elses business
2713572 this is something ive really been looking forward to since i was a young girl
2713573 i didnt really see kirsty on the other side of the pool but i gave everything i possibly had at the end
2713574 it wasnt about getting the world record back its about the olympics and an opportunity that you dont get very often
2713575 someone had told me at the beginning of the meet that whoever gets the first medal is australias 400th and i thought wow thats an amazing honor
2713576 i thought i had a pretty good chance of getting in contention with that but seeing hackett and his race before i thought he may have had a shot and i didnt know about the other sports so it was something i didnt really think about until after the race
2713577 it wasnt what i was looking for i just didnt have the speed
2713578 we both mutually agreed that being together is something that probably wont work during this month and decided to have a break
2713579 i definitely sort of swim best when im nervous and excited and up emotionally
2713580 im definitely an emotional swimmer i dont swim well at the little meets because theres just no excitement id rather not be there
2713581 when the pressure is on i know that everything ive trained for is coming out thats what i wanted to know that i prepared well
2713582 ironically i won my first medal in athens in lane 1 in the 100 backstroke and now here too
2713583 its a tough race to finish and stephanie was just better finishing im very happy with my time
2713584 its her best 400 im by almost five seconds so now its just confidence and staying in control
2713585 theres a six lane highway down by the creek where i went skinny dippin as a child and a drive in show where the meadows used to grow and the strawberries used to grow wild

2713587 germany is going to be a big test for me as there are a few belgian guys coming who are going to be very fast
2713588 i used to be quite weak on tarmac so last year i contested the belgian fst along with fst turkey and this year again i have done two of the three rounds in the belgian championship so hopefully this will put me in good shape for germany with the experience i have gained on tarmac
2713589 our aim for this rally is to try and keep the gap in the championship lead and increase our speed from the previous event but there are ten crews in germany so there are going to be some good battles during the rally
2713590 theres always the saying that you do the plumbing ahead of putting in the gear so we have to be proactive with coming out connectivity technology even before the gear is made available
2713591 theres going to be a transition where some applications will move to fcoe while some will stay in fiber channel and people will get used to the fcoe environment before they move off from fiber channel
2713592 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2713593 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2713594 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2713595 theyre not exactly rooting for him but prominent white supremacists anticipate a boost to their cause if barack obama becomes the first black president
2713596 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2713597 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2713598 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2713599 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2713603 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2713693 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2713694 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2713695 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2713696 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2713697 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2713698 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the backstroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2713699 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2713700 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back

2713713 dont buy the iphone do what you as sensible canadians will do when confronted by prices you cant stand leave the iphone on the shelf
2713714 i will tell you one thing i will not be getting an iphone any time soon rogers i would have bought one on july 11th if you had offered a 30 all you can eat data plan but dont count on it anymore ok
2713715 the fact that the canadian partner has decided not to offer unlimited data plans as part of its offering changes the very nature of this device from one of free flowing integrated in to my life use to a tool where the ever present concern is that the meter is running as i use it as a result i will not be purchasing an iphone 3g until the canadian wireless partner can bring forward pricing plans for its service which are more closely aligned with the natural operating design of the stunning product apple has created i simply cannot justify purchasing an iphone i hope as the visionaries behind the product apple takes a serious look at the service pricing scenarios which rogers has put forward for the iphone and takes the appropriate steps to rectify this problem
2713716 big shock that the plans are terrible and expensive compared to other countries
2713717 just get rid of your phones then people and dont complain dont buy them then

2713727 meu pai minha m e e meu irm o gostam bastante de carne e v o uma vez por semana muitas vezes eu acompanho vamos a uma churrascaria que tem op o de massas e v rios molhos geralmente eu como isso um prato de salada batata frita e banana milanesa
2713728 para aqueles que n o comem carne a gente faz um desconto de r 36 90 no fim de semana eu fa o o pre o da semana que r 26 90
2713729 se voc escolhe uma cantina por exemplo massa e acabou na churrascaria tem uma maior variedade
2713730 durante muitos anos apesar de terem poucas churrascarias eu j freq entava mas j avisava que n o ia querer churrasco de uns dez a 15 anos para c surgiram mais pessoas vegetarianas e v rios restaurantes come aram a adotar esse modelo
2713731 come ou a n o ter mais na poca que as op es ficaram muito maiores
2713732 eles n o fazem desconto porque eu acabo comendo as massas e as saladas que est o no pacote
2713733 antes a gente servia pouca coisa na mesa comia se bastante carne justamente por isso procura dos vegetarianos n s optamos por colocar essa mesa de comida japonesa e incrementar o buf de salada
2713734 eu at prefiro porque tem muita op o em um restaurante s vezes n o tem tanta agora em churrascarias tem at op o de comida japonesa
2713735 tem atleta s vezes que ganha r 1 mil ou r 500 por m s ele pode conseguir at dez vezes mais
2713736 se ele j for um atleta conhecido e ratificou isso atrav s da medalha ele pode ter um valor ampliado de tr s a quatro vezes sobre o que ganha
2713737 um atleta que cobra um cach de r 5 mil para participar de um evento com a medalha ol mpica passa a cobrar r 50 mil r 40 mil
2713738 depende do carisma do atleta de como ele vai trabalhar a imagem dele depois
2713739 n s temos exemplos de atletas que ganharam medalhas de ouro e sumiram
2713740 de forma espont nea o atleta j ter uma grande valoriza o da imagem perante o mundo corporativo mas se tiver uma gest o eficiente de imagem pode capitalizar muito com a conquista
2713741 se voc pega um judoca que durante o ano s vezes tem uma bolsa atleta do governo de r 2 5 mil ele pode vir a ter um patroc nio de r 25 mil por m s ele vai multiplicar por dez o rendimento anual
2713742 a capitaliza o maior nos primeiros oito ou dez meses
2713743 o forte do produto s o os seis primeiros meses no m ximo um ano
2713744 dif cil ter uma m dia exata mas que um atleta capitaliza com uma medalha ainda mais ser for uma de ouro isso ineg vel pois as marcas querem associar sua imagem de um atleta vitorioso
2713745 impulsiona a carreira do atleta mas isso muito no curto prazo
2713746 tudo muito r pido no esporte a conquista ol mpica capitaliza a curto prazo sem d vida mas o atleta tem que enxergar que ele precisa se transformar num produto de marketing atrativo n o apenas em termos esportivos
2713747 isso ajuda sim pois uma motiva o a mais para premiar o que ele fez
2713748 cor o s mbolo da eleg ncia feminina na temporada
2713749 o branco uma cor sempre bem vinda no ver o mas nesta temporada ganha for a o look total aliado aos acess rios
2713750 quando iniciei o desenvolvimento da minha nova cole o pensei muito no branco e nas v rias tonalidades que se aproximam dele
2713751 assim surgiram algumas cores como o sunset color nude off white nevoa blanc casse todas derivadas do branco
2713752 o preto se tornou artif cio um pouco bvio na busca pela eleg ncia
2713753 o branco remete praia ao frescor celebra o sem deixar de ser uma cor cl ssica
2713754 o grande lance est em quebrar o branco total com detalhes metalizados usando acess rios de cores fortes como o rosa o pink uma faixa de cetim amarelo
2713755 o preto emagrece e o branco evidencia as curvas por isso h limita es
2713756 o branco pode ser conciliado com volumes para ter as propor es corretas respeitando as medidas de cada mulher
2713757 our government has requested the removal of all our forces but we are still waiting for the flight schedule
2713758 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2713759 already caused many innocent victims and forced a great number of civilians to leave their homes
2713760 it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence
2713761 i invite the international community and the countries with most influence in the current situation to make every effort to support and promote initiatives aimed at finding a peaceful and lasting solution
2713762 schipper u heeft nog niet eens uw hut gezien wacht eerst maar eventjes ik wil eerst kijken of het er allemaal wel is en het wel voor u op tafel staat
2713763 dat heeft er niets mee te maken zegt de schipper kalm en hij kijkt de verzorgster aan
2713764 een ster zal het anker en het toplicht zijn voor de licht zoeker die zijn leven heelt in eenheid met zichzelf en zijn schepper
2713765 nee toon is er brand in de tent je lult als een adhd patient
2713766 gelukkig niet want als dat wel zo is dan kun je hier in deze ouwe kroeg geen kant op
2713767 zeg dat wel toon men is volendam bijna weer vergeten
2713768 hoe kon je dat nu doen meisje die getalenteerde jongens van
2713769 en dat mochten ze van jou niet eens in ontvangst nemen zonder dat ze dat door jou van te voren verteld was eigenlijk geef je hiermee dus aan dat je voorstander van het jeugdalcoholisme bent of niet soms want dat worden natuurlijk je toekomstige klanten niet soms of heb je misschien problemen met jezelf dat je dat op die jongens af reageert zeg het maar gewoon aan ome toon
2713770 nu snap ik anetje waarom je die ene artiest niet mag hij drinkt geen alcohol en daar kun je dus niets aan verdienen of heb je een hekel aan hem maakt zijn zang en spel misschien emoties in je los die je liever niet toelaat of is het omdat hij ook gratis net als die andere hoog opgeleide muzikanten eraan meewerkt om het op jou terras szomers gezellig te maken zo trekken ze klanten voor jullie en op die manier brengt hij meteen het groeiende probleem van het jeugdalcoholisme bij de volwassen drinkers onder de aandacht en dan betalen die rijnboekaniers toch ook nog mooi effe hun eigen drankje wel zelf terwijl ze mensen meenemen die wel jou zakken vullen ja toch dat ze zich zolang door jou in de maling hebben laten nemen het siert in ieder geval hun incasseringsvermogen en goedheid
2713771 eigenlijk heb je ook daarin wel gelijk toon nu moet ik achteraf gezien lollypop ook wel gelijk geven dat ze hier als barstar opgestapt is daar was ik ook al niet aardig tegen ik kan soms mensen heel erg kwetsen en respectloos behandelen maar ja dat zit nu eenmaal in mijn aard en ik hou niet van straatschoffies en soms vindt ik het wel leuk
2713772 want dan kan ik eindelijk eens laten zien dat ik de bazin ben
2713773 ik kan natuurlijk ook vijfentwintigduizend euro aan de stichting www toongewoon nl doneren dan kunnen ze verder aan hun ideaal werken zal god het me dan wel vergeven toon in de hoop dat ze er dan verder geen publiciteit aan geven want daar is die andere zoetwaterzeerover ook weer heel erg goed in heb ik hier aan de bar gehoord
2713774 goed idee doe dat maar want die schout bij nacht en ontij is een oorlogsveteraan daar kun je beter niet mee spotten hij drinkt geen alcohol houdt alles in de gaten en schrijft gewoon leuke dingen over deze kroeg maar oh wee als je hem over de rooie jaagt dan wordt het echt oorlog met hem vorig jaar had hij nog een mooi lied over deze kroeg geschreven weet je t weer ik ben benieuwd hoe dit jaar zijn lied klinkt en als hij slim is zet hij het lied op internet hyves bijvoorbeeld daar hebben ze toch al duizenden fans en vrienden
2713775 ja aletje eigenlijk voorzie je nu al in hun succes
2713776 das een donders goed idee van je meid maak dat bedrag maar naar hun stichting over en je kunt het van de belasting aftrekken dan houden ze hier vast en zeker in jouw kroeg hun stichting vergaderingen
2713777 jopie heb jij een zakdoek bij je want het wc papier is weer eens op en de plee ziet er niet uit enne droog haar traantjes dan maar even ze gaat in ieder geval de klanten beloven dat ze ze met meer respect gaat behandelen in plaats van alleen hun portemonee
2713778 our bilateral relations are strong and we enjoy one of the most complementary trade relationships in the world mr rudd said
2713779 this is the type of person i want to lead my account
2713780 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions
2713781 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions
2713782 this medal is good for georgia especially during times like this
2713783 i am very nervous today its very difficult for my people
2713784 its very difficult for us as georgians because of everything thats going on at home it was nice that natalia paderina came up to me after and gave me a handshake
2713785 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2713786 laura and i were also saddened by the attack on an american family and their chinese tour guide today in beijing
2713787 the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2713788 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible were banding together as a team to lift up the bachmans and mccutcheons we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2713789 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2713790 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2713791 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2713792 we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goose bumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2713793 appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics
2713794 no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2713795 its far too early to suggest that this has anything to do with the olympics
2713796 i am stupid and easily manipulated please lead me on
2713797 het is tijd voor broederschap we zitten in dezelfde trein in hetzelfde schuitje en daarom is er geen andere optie om samen een krachtig signaal af te geven dat wij dit niet langer pikken

2713822 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly

2713833 pci is hard and our stuff can only help a little
2713834 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2713835 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2713836 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2713837 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2713838 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2713839 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2713840 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2713841 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2713842 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2713843 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2713844 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2713845 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2713846 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2713847 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2713848 the old british empire and the former french colonial empire have now ceased to exist but the damage which they wreaked in their greed and arrogance lives on
2713849 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2713850 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2713851 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2713852 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2713853 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2713854 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2713855 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2713856 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2713857 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2713858 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2713859 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2713860 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2713861 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2713862 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2713863 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2713864 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2713865 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2713866 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2713867 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2713868 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2713869 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2713870 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2713871 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2713872 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2713873 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2713874 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2713875 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2713876 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2713877 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2713878 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2713879 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2713880 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2713881 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2713882 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2713883 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2713884 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2713885 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2713886 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2713887 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2713888 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2713889 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2713890 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2713891 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2713892 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2713893 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2713894 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2713895 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2713896 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2713897 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2713898 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2713899 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal rights and interests of other people
2713900 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2713901 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2713902 its really the military component that is at the forefront now not so much the diplomatic effort
2713903 leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and therell be no consequences
2713904 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2713905 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare
2713906 yeah i didnt think anyone would ever know about it i didnt
2713907 ive come to the personal conclusion that i actually want the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences
2713908 for example the wind industry it was nothing in the 1970s today one third of all terrestrial wind turbines in the world come from denmark
2713909 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
2713910 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2713911 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
2713912 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months
2713913 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win
2713914 it simply does not have the built in domestic constituency of defense programs
2713915 as an example the f 22 aircraft is produced by companies in 44 states thats 88 senators
2713916 military force usually has the opposite effect from what is intended
2713917 we need to believe in the power of american diplomacy and we should not believe a military conflict with iran is inevitable
2713918 our first impulse should be a serious and patient and persistent diplomatic effort too often in our national debate we focus on the military option and give short shrift to the diplomatic option

2713927 maintaining balance between my personal faith and the many pressures that one experiences in the political arena is the biggest challenge i face
2713928 i have to make sure that i stay fresh with my personal walk with god at the same time i dont use the law or my position to impose faith i certainly feel the freedom to share my faith and use it as a point of influence but i have to stop just short of ever coercing people into a point of view because i have a position of authority
2713929 building a safety net of health and education under children first comes to mind there have been a number of things in our administration that have been a landmark in this area
2713930 the covenant marriage act was passed in 2001 there are a number of reasons for the covenant marriage let me give you a couple of specific examples the university of utah did a study in which they found that in arkansas alone the cost of divorce in state and federal dollars was 537 million dollars thats the cost in our state in one year but if you add up all the associated costs for divorce it a huge amount of money money that can be used far better on building roads and paying teacher salaries or scholarships for college kids instead were paying for the break up of marriages and families and all the costs associated with it
2713931 i think that it is important to do that i regret that it has to be important it should be that the definition of marriage is an understood given based on 5 000 years of recorded human history judges who have been willing in essence to overthrow the definition of marriage have forced states like arkansas to amend their constitutions in this way the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman as life partners becomes clear and unequivocal
2713932 it is appropriate that we define things when society gets cloudy thats why we have laws
2713933 love the lord you god with all your heart mind and soul
2713934 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all
2713935 so spatzi du solltest jetzt ins bett es ist doch schon sp t und du mu t morgen in den kindergarten

2713939 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2713940 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2713941 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2713942 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2713943 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2713944 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2713945 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2713946 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2713947 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2713948 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2713949 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2713950 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2713951 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2713952 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2713953 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2713954 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2713955 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2713956 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2713957 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2713958 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2713959 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2713960 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2713961 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2713962 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2713963 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2713964 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2713965 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2713966 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2713967 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2713968 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2713969 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2713970 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2713971 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2713972 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2713973 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2713974 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2713975 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2713976 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2713977 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2713978 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2713979 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2713980 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2713981 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2713982 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2713983 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2713984 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2713985 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2713986 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2713987 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2713988 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2713989 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2713990 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2713991 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2713992 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2713993 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2713994 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2713995 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2713996 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2713997 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2713998 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2713999 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2714000 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2714001 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2714002 who are open to doing something on the production side
2714003 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2714004 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2714005 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2714006 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2714007 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2714008 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2714009 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2714010 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2714011 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2714012 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2714013 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2714014 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2714015 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2714016 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2714017 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2714018 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2714019 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2714020 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2714021 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2714088 on his second voyage cook used the k1 chronometer made by larcum kendall which was the shape of a large pocket watch 13 cm 5 inches in diameter it was a copy of the h4 clock made by john harrison which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea
2714089 from their tiny kingdom lying off the northern shores of europe the anglo saxon people went out over the world taking their laws their method of government and their language with them they built their colonies in north america setting out their farms in the wide plains and green valleys of the new world they peopled australia and new zealand they went into africa and asia governing many different people to whom they taught their language and their law they planted parliaments in many lands believing that representational government and government by consultation and consent were unarguably and self evidently the best some of those parliaments have thrived and some have changed into institutions far different from that at westminster for three hundred years or more they dominated the oceans of the globe and for a brief hundred and fifty years they dominated the world itself as rome had dreamed of a world of free citizens with people of many lands sharing a common law and a common loyalty so did they dream and briefly believed the vision was reality the fashion now is to deride the dream and mock the dreamers of it yet the conception was not idle nor completely unfulfilled through it millions of folk around the world who are not kin to the anglo saxon people have democracy as their ideal and the rule of law as their acknowledged aim the anglo saxon people in their own kingdom their blood and traditions enriched by their neighbours the scots the welsh and the irish have given much to the world perhaps more than the world now cares to acknowledge the same folk enriched by the adventurous and the poor by the exiled defenders of lost causes by the dispossesed and the persecuted who thronged to them from all the countries of europe have built a younger and vigorous land in the new world greece had great gifts to offer but left to the romans the task of disseminating those gifts throughout the civilised world the anglo saxon folk have been their own messengers rome built the long roads along which hellenistic thought travelled to asia minor north africa spain and the yorkshire moors the anglo saxons built their own ships and their own roads by which were transmitted their ideas of government by consent of freedom to worship god in any way a man pleases and of a body of law which binds all men including kings and lawmakers for they have possessed through succeeding ages not only these basic ideas on how society should be organised but also a great restlessness the knowledge that the sea is a highway and not a barrier and the belief that a man may make a home wherever a ship can carry him a man can exercise his skills anywhere can rear sheep or raise cattle even though midsummers day blazes in december can fell a tropic thorn tree as well as a northern oak and can drive a plough in a vast field many thousand miles westward of his former and smaller farm where did the anglo saxon people obtain these qualities their impatience with authority their obstinacy in defeat their insistence upon old and inalienable rights their urge to build new homesteads and new countries overseas are all these things inherited and reinforced by a process of natural selection what were the different ethnic components that made up the whole people and what were the main events that bought together the many different folk who went to their making

2714097 j rg haider und ewald stadler haben sich ausgeredet wir ziehen wieder gemeinsam an einem strang und haben ein ziel nie wieder rot schwarz
2714098 berger l sst kindersch nder einfach davonkommen nichts tun verhandlungen abbrechen und dann mit einem unfertigen halbherzigen paket winken das ist nicht mehr als eine durchsichtige sp show auf dem r cken der sicherheit die zeigt dass der justizministerin der schutz unserer kinder offenbar egal ist
2714099 was muss passieren bis berger endlich aufwacht auf welcher seite steht die ministerin berhaupt bisher l sst sich nicht erkennen dass ihr der gewaltschutz der sterreicherinnen und sterreicher auch nur im entferntesten am herzen liegt
2714100 die vp will eine deutliche erh hung der strafen f r sexualstraft ter und eine klare handhabe zum schutz der bev lkerung
2714101 dieses schein paket von berger liefert einen nachhaltigen eindruck davon was die sp unter verantwortungsvoller arbeit f r sterreich versteht nicht mehr als show die liste der vers umnisse bergers beim diesem paket ist lang
2714102 seit eineinhalb jahren macht die vp druck seit eineinhalb jahren ist die sp ministerin unt tig und jetzt kurz vor der wahl will berger ein unfertiges unverhandeltes paket einbringen das am ziel vorbeigeht zahnlos und damit weit vom ziel entfernt ist verantwortungsvolle arbeit f r die sicherheit in sterreich sieht anders aus bei kindersch ndern muss die volle h rte des gesetzes gelten dieses kuschelpaket wird es mit der vp nicht geben

2714107 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2714108 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2714109 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2714110 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2714111 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2714112 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2714113 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2714114 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2714115 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2714116 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2714117 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2714118 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2714119 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2714120 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2714121 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2714122 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2714123 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2714124 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2714125 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2714126 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2714127 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2714128 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

2714139 you know when i look at what sen hillary clinton is going through when i see that instinct of hers to fight on behalf of those who need a champion she reminds me a little of me
2714140 hes never known anything else here in hawaii the proportion of women working outside the home has always been high
2714141 he carries our stories stories of women and our struggles with him every day
2714142 theyre not pretentious his grandmothers lived in the same two bedroom apartment for 40 years they never drove fancy cars they chose to put their resources into education and travel their success was based on intellect and hard work grandparents who sacrificed its the american story
2714143 anybody with the first name of stanley which is what we all called her had to have a little bit of moxie
2714144 one had the feeling that she just wasnt as silly as the rest of the high school girls
2714145 she was a thinker and a questioner definitely a questioner
2714146 i think that because of her personality and her intellect that she was able to look at the wider broader world not just our little world that we were in it really showed in what she pursued in her education and her life work she chose to better the lives of women and children before the rest of us got on that bandwagon
2714147 in those days in 20 plus states their relationship would have put them in jail
2714148 she was a remarkable woman it was a statement of the kind of person that she was prepared to be
2714149 she was my first boss we were afraid of her because she was so gruff but she was a very warm person after you got to know her and you proved that you could do the job
2714150 the work ethic she gave me was if you want to get ahead you work hard and you work wise
2714151 i cannot remember ever being with her when she didnt talk about him
2714152 all of her friends knew about barry we gathered that he was very sharp very interesting and was going to be doing exceptional things there was never any question about that
2714153 barry found his feet in the streets of chicago it was urban but it was the same thing get out there to talk to people listen to their needs and try to put together something that will work like ann he was thinking how do you help the folks who need it
2714154 sen hillary clinton told a gathering of supporters last week that shes looking for a strategy for her delegates to have their voices heard and respected at the democratic national convention and did not rule out the possibility of having her name placed into nomination at the convention alongside sen barack obamas

2714196 while the focus of tb control is on prompt case detection and effective treatment better housing conditions and reduced levels of crowding also have a role in controlling the spread of this disease
2714197 unlike some previous studies we were able to control for the effects of known risk factors notably poverty and migration from high incidence countries linking to census data also allowed us to include a relatively large number of cases
2714198 the finding that tb rates are associated with crowded living conditions fits with what we know about the transmission of this bacteria via small airborne droplets
2714199 household crowding increases opportunities for active cases to infect other household members particularly children
2714200 even though new zealand is managing tb well within our own borders there is no cause for complacency in the face of this global epidemic

2714237 this project is linked to the decision that al sayyid muqtada al sadr issued over a month ago when he divided the al mahdi army into two parts the first includes thousands and millions of al mahdi army elements who have been banned from carrying arms and who have been ordered to engage in religious cultural and social programs and the second includes those who will be chosen by leader muqtada al sadr to form jihad brigades and fight against the occupation forces
2714238 such brigades are yet to be formed and we are waiting for the outcome of the negotiations over an agreement between iraq and the united states
2714239 the al mumahhidun project will deal with the first part of the al mahdi army that is those who will engage in religious seminary related and cultural awareness programs
2714240 the al mahdi army will be transformed into a non political cultural and social organization
2714241 this supervision will allow the sadrist trend to nominate lecturers and figures who will contribute to the implementation of the al mumahhidun project on the religious level as for the cultural level there is a cultural commission that is in charge of determining curricula and nonreligious cultural programs provided for those participating in this project
2714242 al sayyid kazim al hairi the al sadr trend religious authority will supervise the kind of curricula that will be offered
2714243 we have witnessed the emergence of educational programs that suit the occupation stage and the ideas associated with it such as the division of iraq into northern central and southern regions including the kirkuk problem which is affecting us today some giant institutions have started to implement these educational programs in a systematic way
2714244 as for our educational programs they will be directed toward adhering to iraqs unity and the need not to divide it
2714245 moreover pro occupation institutions encourage secularism they work toward portraying religion as being responsible for the murders that have taken place and accuse it of encouraging sectarian fighting whereas the truth is that no sectarian fighting has taken place in iraq instead these are terrorist crimes committed by terrorist groups al qaeda and our sunni brothers confronted these groups when the truth about them was exposed
2714246 we want to direct the al mumahhidun toward the unity of the iraqi people regardless of any sectarian religious or nationalistic considerations
2714247 all iraqis are equal what we care about is the strong unity of all shades groups and formations of the iraqi people
2714248 there are no plans to form a religious islamic state we adhere to a nationalistic state that guarantees the rights of all formations and religious and ethnic shades of the iraqi people
2714249 this has made us adopt a certain position toward the kirkuk problem we want to guarantee the rights of minorities particularly kildans and assyrians away from the interests and struggles of major powers
2714250 these programs will be implemented by cultural institutions belonging to the sadrist trend such as the higher cultural commission and the baqiyyatallah cultural centers
2714251 over 120 centers are spread all over iraq for more than a year now
2714252 these centers will represent the basis from which the al mumahhidun project will be launched
2714253 the al mumahhidun project will revive the literacy campaign that we started in 2006 and as a result of which we managed to help more than 1 000 iraqis become literate
2714254 the program will improve the educational level of those who had to quit their education for political economic or social reasons and will include programs that care for the children of martyrs
2714255 there are private schools belonging to martyr office that are registered at the ministry of education abdallah al radi schools these schools have been open for five years in al najaf and al sadr city more branches will be opened in the other iraqi governorates
2714256 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine

2714258 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging

2714266 mijn kwalificatie voor de spelen tijdens het wk vorig jaar was heel bijzonder
2714267 zowel voor mij als in het algemeen want alhoewel ik het op het moment zelf niet wist bleek ik daarmee de eerste mannelijke turner uit nederland sinds 1928 die zich voor de spelen heeft geplaatst
2714268 het gebeurde tijdens de rekstokfinale nadat nemov die had afgerond werd hij volgens het publiek te slecht beoordeeld door de jury een enorm protest stak op en de wedstrijd werd gestaakt beelden staan hier het meest opmerkelijke was dat de jury daarna met een hoger oordeel kwam en zich dus duidelijk had laten be nvloeden het werd een enorme rel in de turnsport waarna een aantal van die juryleden werd geschorst en terecht want het publiek protesteert wel vaker omdat het minder kennis heeft dan de juryleden
2714269 het publiek kan daarom een onderdeel heel anders beoordelen dan een professional die kan zien dat er toch wat slordigheden in de oefening zaten de jury mag zich nooit laten be nvloeden en mag al helemaal niet een beoordeling veranderen
2714270 maar zulke extreme ervaringen heb ik nooit gehad op het laatste wk heb ik wel meegemaakt dat anderen mijn oefening hoger aansloegen dan de jury mijn collegas vonden dat ik op de derde plaats had moeten eindigen en niet op de vierde
2714271 scherbo won in 1992 goud met zijn team op de meerkamp en op vier van de zes toestellen dat is een unieke prestatie die zijn enorme klasse laat zien hij is de grote turner van zijn tijd nu is zo iets onmogelijk omdat het niveau zoveel hoger is er zijn niet meer van dit soort allrounders omdat er zoveel specialisten op de toestellen zijn gekomen dat vind ik overigens geen probleem want door die specialisten is op elk gebied het niveau enorm gegroeid er is een duidelijk verschil tussen de meerkamp en de toestellen waardoor er meer klasse is
2714272 vanaf toen heb ik hem extra gevolgd want hij was voor mij een voorbeeld zo goed wil ik ook worden dacht ik toen alhoewel ik mijn eigen kwaliteiten toen nog niet kende
2714273 das ist so hnlich wie wenn ein gro er baum gef llt wird

2714275 i only accepted to do it because i had nothing to do when i come from work instillation was easy pretty fast as well and it has more programs than it did before the only thing missing is quicken i need quicken to manage my business otherwise it really improved a lot
2714276 i thought linux didnt change at all i thought that they just added few features and programs but i was wrong it has everything i need such as mozilla thunderbird mozilla firefox xchat openoffice and many programs but even though i decided to use ubuntu as my main os i must have windows in my computer even if i barely use it
2714277 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale in these conditions our forces conducted redeployment
2714278 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2714279 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2714280 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2714281 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia

2714285 but were only four races into this this is a very long event were not even halfway through ill take it one day and one race at a time and just keep on moving
2714286 he had a fantastic opportunity to protest me and probably get me disqualified so i had to take a penalty turn which cost me distance
2714287 its the olympics and you try and you do anything you can to get an advantage on your opponent and most of the fleet try and give me a hard time when they can
2714288 hes sailing really well hes been in the class for three years and continually improving we will have to see if we can give him a hard time in the next couple of days
2714289 should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
2714290 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time said robert helman who was covered in cuts and bruises
2714291 my windows just cracked and they blew out oliveira said
2714292 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2714293 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down he said

2714301 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2714302 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2714303 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2714304 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2714305 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2714352 paul is not an advocate of what modern persons call tent making ministry if by that one means that church planters or missionaries should expect to have to work on the side or raise their own support whilst doing ministry
2714353 what this means is that atheism has become a cultural designation rather than a theological statement some are likely declaring themselves atheists as a statement of hostility to organized religion rather than to god this might help explain polls showing rising numbers of atheists

2714511 his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him and we hid as it were our faces from him
2714512 every eye shall see him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him
2714513 and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged
2714514 for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have showed toward his name
2714515 blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people to remember his holy covenant the oath which he sware to our father abraham
2714516 i remember thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when thou wentest after me in the wilderness
2714517 and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
2714518 if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it
2714519 in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted
2714520 for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done
2714521 be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you
2714522 i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also
2714523 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day
2714524 these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life
2714525 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
2714526 know that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit
2714527 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him
2714528 brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men
2714529 in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart
2714530 the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened
2714531 we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers
2714532 he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and brake them and they did all eat and were filled
2714533 we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you
2714534 i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ
2714535 first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all
2714536 and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god
2714537 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
2714538 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us full of grace and truth
2714539 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and empty and darkness was on the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved on the face of the waters
2714540 and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless
2714541 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come
2714542 go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage
2714543 therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god
2714544 and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lords and he will give you into our hands
2714545 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
2714546 some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the lord our god
2714547 there is no king saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy
2714548 upon this rock of faith in christ as divine savior i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
2714549 woe unto him that saith to the wood awake to the dumb stone arise it shall teach behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in the midst of it
2714550 their idols are silver and gold the work of mens hands they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see not they that make them are like unto them so is every one that trusteth in them
2714551 the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven
2714552 the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
2714553 for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god
2714554 see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven
2714555 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed
2714556 always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh
2714557 that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus
2714558 though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory
2714559 if our earthly house i e body of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens
2714560 a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better
2714561 at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints
2714562 them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him and the dead in christ shall rise first
2714563 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
2714564 should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance
2714565 that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god for ever
2714566 the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
2714567 his bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of jacob
2714568 he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the eye shall he not see
2714569 god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time
2714570 i cant get a feature of this iphone app work the result is im going to settle on an inferior approach app wont be as good fucking nda
2714571 the fucking nda is here to stay it has certainly crushed my enthusiasm for the platform big time
2714572 re the fucking nda its pretty clear that this is being done for competitive reasons at the cost of a lot of developer productivity
2714573 it started out as a joke on twitter with the iphone community
2714574 i figured i would get about 10 000 visitors a day and it would go away in about a week the site has been linked to and commented on twitter ever since
2714575 there is no legal way for developers to talk about what they are developing
2714576 no way to post tutorials no way to give code away its hard to interact with other developers and to write code without reinventing the wheel normally you could post a coding question on twitter and get an answer within minutes
2714577 it has something to do with keeping competitors from looking into it and finding out what apple did
2714578 with the nda were unable to talk with one another
2714579 we want the developer community to be a lot like the open source developing community where you can help and talk to one another about the best way to do these things
2714580 and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
2714581 broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat
2714582 ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell
2714583 into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
2714584 but the fearful and unbelieving and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
2714585 he that is unjust will be unjust still and he which is filthy will be filthy still
2714586 and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
2714587 whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god
2714588 wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations
2714589 an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you

2714628 civil servants who took generous early retirement deals from the dvla in swansea are being re engaged as consultants at up to 800 a day we can reveal today
2714629 i would like to make you aware of an issue that is being discussed among the staff of dvla as a scandal
2714630 over the last two years dvla has been offering a voluntary early retirement scheme under which staff over the age of 50 with adequate service could retire with a lump sum of three years pay their pensions topped up to the maximum and three months pay
2714631 this was to massage the head count of dvla down to comply with government targets i understand 50 members of staff ultimately left under this scheme
2714632 to date 20 of these staff have been brought back as consultants with daily pay at between 600 and 800 occasionally to do their previous jobs and in some cases to carry out little more than administrative tasks
2714633 a significant number of staff consider this a huge waste of taxpayers money and an affront to their hard work if these skills were so vital to the dvla why were they granted permission to retire early while the head count is now minutely lower these staff are at a cost of at least 10 times more than previously
2714634 of course were incredibly pleased delighted would probably be a better adjective that nintendo approached us but its not an exclusive relationship i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there

2714683 she just played better than me on the day i tried to hang in there but she was too consistent and too experienced
2714684 i gave her some easy points but she never gave me any it was tough to recover after a really tough match on saturday but overall i am happy with my performance
2714685 we let the chinese get away from us and we were racing the australians and the dutch but that was right up there with our best rows of the season
2714686 our training has been going well but this gives us a big confidence boost which was something we needed
2714687 racing conditions were perfect not too humid and i know we can move on on thursday i cant wait
2714688 we were very well prepared and trained and had a good solid race
2714689 it was a very tight race with strong competition all four crews were in a line and we were just the ones that lost out
2714690 we have another chance in the repechage its not ideal but we have to cope with it and our aim is to peak in the final
2714691 son dont take too much time away theyll figure out they didnt need you
2714692 they our forces have been withdrawn completely because of the heavy casualties georgia has suffered
2714693 units of the georgian armed forces have started withdrawing from tskhinvali
2714694 the withdrawal has been spotted by the peacekeeping forces intelligence the georgian side has indeed started removing its units
2714695 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people
2714696 we have received proposals for some sort of contact from the georgian side but we see yet again that they fail to grasp the meaning of what happened in the early 1990s when abkhazia and south ossetia broke away and they do not understand or do not want to understand what is going on now
2714697 the crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
2714698 ukraine reserves the right to bar warships and vessels which could take part in the action from returning to ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2714699 on saturday in a statement that hinted how the conflict could widen still further russia took a swipe at ukraine accusing it of
2714700 the humanitarian situation is horrifying we have no cameras and cannot document what we can see but the morgues are busy receiving streams of dead bodies
2714701 the situation is tense but somewhat quieter the city is not being shelled we hear faraway artillery salvoes sometimes by all accounts georgian troops are indeed leaving south ossetia
2714702 it definitely felt good and i was definitely happy when it went in
2714703 i definitely wanted that shot marijonas made a great play and found me wide open
2714704 i felt that we could have won it i took a shot and missed linas came down and hit a big one sometimes it goes your way sometimes it goes their way
2714705 emotionally this loss is important because it puts a lot of pressure on you for the next game and the following ones were going to have to play through it
2714706 we know the kind of teams that spain greece germany lithuania russia the u s of course have its going to be very difficult everybody has a shot i dont believe that any of the eight top teams doesnt have a shot

2714710 what happened last season will only make us more determined
2714711 i had a few good seasons before i went to chelsea and i managed to improve every year but moving to england was the next logical step for me in my career

2714714 the ovation the fans gave me was just overwhelming absolutely amazing but what a fantastic way to start the season we started like a train and i dont think burnley knew what hit them
2714715 let me tell you my priority is sheffield wednesday but if we can finish the season at the top of the table and burnley finish second that would be perfect from my point of view
2714716 but pre season is the time to straighten out problems
2714717 the realy important work begins now though and i am sure that the team will sort out the little details that sometimes leads to goals being let in

2714726 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2714727 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2714728 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2714729 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2714730 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2714731 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2714732 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2714733 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2714734 rat meat has huge potential to be developed into a popular dish which if extensively commercialized will tackle almost 50 per cent of the food crisis in the country

2714736 vraag anders maar aan pa caveman hoe het was voor lubbers regeerde
2714737 opsluiting is leuk maar het moet natuurlijk niet te lang achter elkaar duren
2714738 jij hebt makkelijk praten caveman jij kan al om 3 uur naar huis toe
2714739 ik ben bezig met het systeem van binnen uit uit te hollen
2714740 het systeem welk systeem het telco systeem van ons of een ander systeem
2714741 een bijbaan maar dat levert toch alleen maar nog meer geld op dat kost je klauwen met belasting joh
2714742 natuurlijk niet het kost me amper wat ik heb het gewoon goed aangepakt
2714743 weet je nog die maandag een paar maanden geleden dat ik in de file stond en zo laat op het werk was
2714744 die keer dat ik het idee had dat ik in de rij stond voor een conferentie van de stichting van vrijwillige euthenasiepatienten
2714745 op de weg terug stond ik weer in de file en toen kreeg ik een perfect idee ik heb me aangemeld bij die stichting
2714746 uhh csc kerel je gaat geen enge dingen doen he je moet nog een paar jaartjes mee hoor
2714747 ja dat is ook mijn bedoeling ik ben daarom ook maar bij het enige stabiele onderdeel van de stichting gegaan en het enige dat constant is is natuurlijk het bestuur ik ben penningmeester geworden en de zaken lopen goed joh het systeem holt nu echt snel uit en alles wat ik doe is visitekaartjes uitdelen
2714748 uhh nu ben ik je even kwijt geraakt joh leg uit wat doe je nu precies en hoe kan je op deze manier het belastingsysteem uithollen en wat moet je ooit met visitekaartjes doen
2714749 ik heb een paar duizend visitekaartjes laten maken met de volgende tekst erop als jij het hoax gen hebt ben jij het einde
2714750 ja echt een hoax gen ik leg uit als je een kansloze gast tegen komt of nog beter een te zware vrouw vrouw met een legging aan dan geef spreek ik ze even aan ik leg rustig mijn punten uit dat ik een wetenschapper ben die bezig is met onderzoek naar de dna van de mensheid dat elk mens natuurlijk dna heeft en dan gooi ik wat leuke termen erin over hoax genen en dat je aan bepaalde mensen zo kan zien dat zij ze bezitten zonder gebruik te maken van sequencers en andere lastige zaken
2714751 tja je moet toch wat doen om je verhaal geloofwaardig te maken he
2714752 hierna ga ik door dat mensen met die genen een belasting vormen op de genenpool en dat ze beter contact op kunnen nemen met de stichting waar ik voor werk
2714753 ja natuurlijk doen ze dat als ze dat doen dan krijgen ze een informatie pakket waar een gemiddelde persoon eerst afspraken van zou maken met een psycholoog als je het alleen goed inkleed dan worden ze vanzelf lid van je stichting
2714754 ja maar hoe hol je nu het belastingsysteem uit van binnen uit want dat snap ik ngo niet helemaal
2714755 kerel gebruik je hersenen eens mensen betalen allemaal belasting toch als ze weg vallen eventueel door toedoen van de stichting dan kunnen ze geen belasting meer betalen dus de belastinginkomsten dalen hiernaast ben ik nog goed bezig ook ik spreek alleen mensen tussen de 20 en de 40 aan uitzonderingen daar gelaten dus de pensioenfondsen blijven ook nog eens in stand voor mensen zoals jij en ik die niet met namaakgenen opgescheept zitten en ik help op deze manier ook nog eens mee de overbevolking van de planeet op te heffen
2714756 maar wat verdien jij er dan mee want anders danmoet jij alsnog belasting betalen
2714757 joh alles wat ik verdien investeer ik in visitekaartjes en informatie pakketten ow wacht even ik zie iemand lopen
2714758 hallo mag ik even wat van uw tijd stelen ik ben een geneticus die bezig is met een onderzoek naar de genen van de mensheid
2714759 hgc je lijkt er wel met je hoofd niet bij te zitten wil je ergens over praten
2714760 het proces is niet goed aan het gaan ik moet er voor zorgen dat wij een klant gerichte organisatie worden maar het gaat niet goed mensen accepteren hun tickets niet en mensen escaleren de problemen niet snel genoeg en dat terwijl het gewoon allemaal net zo hoort te gaan als met vrouwen het grootste nadeel is dat ik er op afgerekend wordt door het management
2714761 management ooit geleerd dat je niet mag vloeken man heb het dan over het m woord ofzo
2714762 onderbreek me niet maar ja zoals met vrouwen de gemiddelde huisvrouw heeft een zeer liefhebbende man deze is natuurlijk teder en doet alles voor de vrouw als ze echter wat mee willen dan komen ze bij mij dan hebben ze dus duidelijk een probleem dat staat gelijk aan het aanmaken van een helpdesk ticket iemand heeft het heel goed maar toch mist die persoon iets dan melden ze een incidentje aan bij de helpdesk dat incident moet beoordeeld worden zoals je weet zijn er diverse klassificaties klasse a incidenten zijn niet zo belangrijk die kan je rustig doorschuiven naar mensen die minder weten klasse b moeten binnen een paar uur opgelost worden en voor klasse c moet je alles laten vallen wat je doet het zelfde geld met vrouwen je zit lekker in een disco een drankje te drinken en er komt een vrouw langs die kan je onderverdelen in 3 categorieen als ze een ongelovelijke rotkop heeft kan je ze doorschuiven naar de man naast je dat is een niet urgent probleem en kan door anderen opgelost worden als ze er best oke uitziet is het een klasse b incident is het echter een geweldig mooie vrouw en moet je meteen met haar mee naar een donkere parkeerplaats is het een klasse c incident
2714763 sorry ik ben al jaren getrouwd ik zou niet meer weten hoe dat gaat
2714764 als je een klasse c incident hebt dat interessant is en je hebt het een keer opgelost dan moet je zorgen dat mensen dat soort incidenten snel weer melden als een incident meerdere keren voor komt dan wordt het namelijk een standaard change de klasse a changes moet je snel weer afschuiven op minderen de klasse c changes moeten zo snel mogelijk opgelost worden voor sommige klasse c changes moet je zelfs een zwart boekje aan leggen als je het goed aanpakt kan je dan niet zonder werk komen te zitten zo een zekerheid op werk heet dan ook een zekerheidje het beste zekerheidje kan je midden in de nacht bellen en zeggen over een uurtje sta je daar en dan gaan we hard aan de slag
2714765 ah dus je hebt een zwart boekje en een soort verzekeringsbedrijf
2714766 nu alleen nog het escalatieproces dat is belangrijk voor jullie let dus even goed op als er een standaard change of een incident niet snel genoeg opgelost kan worden dan moeten jullie dat gaan escaleren stel je voor dat er een vrouw langs komt dat zo leuk is dat ze eigenlijk meteen opglost moet worden een klasse c incident maar je bent al druk bezig en hebt er geen tijd voor dan moet je het door zetten naar de tweede lijns helpdesk he
2714767 vanaf nu moeten jullie daar eerst voor langs komen bij de coordinator van de afdeling die het proces in de gaten houdt ik wordt afgerekend op bepaalde doelen 80 van de incidenten en calls moeten binnen de gestelde tijd afgewerkt worden als jullie het zlef niet op kunnen lossen moeten jullie naar mij komen om dat te melden als jullie een mooie vrouw langs zien komen en jullie redden het niet om dat zelf op te lossen dan stuur je die maar naar mij toe dan kijk ik wel wat ik er mee doe desnoods los ik het zelf wel op
2714768 je bent wel wakker vandaag joh en dat op een maandag morgen je hebt altijd jagers of verzamelaars ik doe beide ik jaag eerst en daarna ga ik verzamelen
2714769 en heb je nog een theorie over de hoeveelheid zekerheidjes een mens hoort te hebben
2714770 ja hoor je moet altijd 7 zekerheidjes hebben 1 voor elke dag
2714771 ik zou er dan nog een paar in reserve houden als ik jou was dan heb je in elk geval bij ziekte en uitval altijd nog een reserve
2714772 is een heel goed punt ik ga meteen even een paar oude zekerheidjes bellen dat ze snel klaar moeten gaan staan
2714773 weet je wat helemaal erg is ik heb vandaag mijn schoonouders op visite ik kan je wel zeggen dat dat goed is voor je overuren je blijft spontaan een paar uur langer hier zitten
2714774 pa caveman vertelde ooit een verhaal dat hij eens gehoord had dat iemand zijn schoonmoeder uit het raam wilde springen hij is er meteen heen gegaan
2714775 was die gek dan zo gehecht aan zijn schoonmoeder dat is lastig voor te stellen hoor
2714776 nee maar het raam klemde en hij ging het even smeren
2714777 how could i have been so uncurious if i held a match to my heart would i be able to see its workings would i know my body the way i know a city with its internal civilization of chemical messengers electrical storms cellular cities in which past present and future are contained would i walk the thousand miles of arterial roadways branching paths of communication and coiled tubing for waste and nutrients would i know where the passion to live and love comes from it is no wonder we neglect the natural world outside ourselves when we do not have the interest to know the one within
2714778 je oom marconist was altijd vol sterke verhalen weet je nog ik heb een verhaal dat zo sterk is dat het echt gebeurd is
2714779 ik was bij oom marconist aan het logeren toen ik nog een kleine pa caveman was en was daar met pe lekker in de ringvaart aan het zwemmen gegaan pe had een brilletje op zijn neus staan en bij het duiken ging het verkeerd pe raakte zijn brilletje kwijt natuurlijk paniek want een bril kostte toen nog heel veel geld
2714780 naar huis gaan en tante albastine het verhaal vertellen was geen goed idee een oude oostenrijkse struise meid zou kleine pe alle hoeken van de kamer laten zien wij moesten dus wat anders verzinnen zowel oom schrijver als pe als kleine pa caveman gingen dus maar duiken naar het brilletje na een middag vruchteloze duikpogingen gedaan te hebben moesten we het wel vertellen aan oom marconist en tante albastine we hebben toen maar oom marconist er bij gehaald en hem het verhaal verteld wat denk je dat er toen gebeurde
2714781 oom marconist riep ons vervolgens dicht bij hem en hij zei het volgende als je iets heel graag terug wilt vinden moet je de hulp van de heilige antonius inroepen we moeten straks in koor de volgende zin zeggen heilige antonius beste vriend zorg dat ik mijn bril weer vind daarna moeten we kijken wat er gebeurt snapt iedereen het een keertje op proef
2714782 het pannetje werd in het water gegooid en wat denk je het brilletje van pe zat in het pannetje geen modder alleen maar water en het brilletje
2714783 heilige antonius beste vrind zorg dat ik mijn sleutels vind

2714805 the interpretation of the upper back dial as a calendar dial is not new but the authors have for the first time been able to recover all month names from the few heavily damaged remaining fragments of the 235 original labels
2714806 historians of astronomy had until now doubted that this scheme had been actually used in civil life but the evidence from the antikythera mechanism now proves them wrong
2714807 one has to find a way to divide time into logical units of days and months that follow accurately the movements of the heavenly bodies
2714808 an ideal calendar should work without requiring astronomers to intervene annually to align the calendar year with the tropical year which determines the seasons
2714809 new details uncovered on the operation of the antikythera mechanism indicate that it may have been common for greek civil calendars to follow the highly accurate 19 year metonic cycle by about 100 b c

2714850 doveva succedere perch dal momento in cui fai ascoltare unanteprima dellalbum quello fa il giro della rete prima che si venda regolarmente su itunes ma gi da tempo la vendita degli album aveva cessato di essere una fonte di guadagno stabile per gli artisti la ragione che i contratti delle major discografiche con le star non venivano pi stipulati a favore di queste ultime cosa che sempre stata un po vera ma di recente si era inasprita
2714851 si son trovate a cercare il metodo pi efficace per arrotondare quindi i concerti nei cui guadagni la casa di produzione non coinvolta
2714852 con il vecchio modello il contratto capestro dellartista con la casa discografica si arrivava al paradosso di band con album primi in classifica che non si vedevano entrare un centesimo in tasca e band che senza fare album facevano migliaia di dollari

2714866 dialah bulan yang permulaannya rahmat pertengahannya ampunan dan akhirnya pembebasan dari neraka barangsiapa meringankan beban dari budak sahaya termasuk di sini para pembantu rumah niscaya allah mengampuni dosanya dan memerdekakannya dari neraka
2714867 oleh karena itu banyakkanlah yang empat perkara di bulan ramadhan dua perkara untuk mendatangkan keridhaan tuhanmu dan dua perkara lagi kamu sangat menghajatinya

2714897 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish lettering and a cartoonish invitation to a delight or a scam in this case theres spongebob squarepants saying it dont gitmo better
2714898 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
2714899 never even said theres a link between al qaeda and iraq
2714900 obama cant point to a single instance in which sean hannity or talk radio
2714901 3 4 increase in single copy newsstand sales for the first half of 2008
2714902 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
2714903 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
2714904 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2714905 the activities of many organizations of the civil rights era
2714906 dr kings type of resistance to the u s version of apartheid could surely be considered homegrown terrorism
2714907 supreme arbiters of which ideas parties and candidates are permitted to effectively compete in the public arena
2714908 our politics has gotten so ah nasty thats the word i was looking for
2714909 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right so im happy to have a battle of words because ive got facts on my side
2714910 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
2714911 we have sensed a lack of enthusiasm from the obama camp
2714912 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
2714913 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
2714914 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument
2714915 have you seen the paris hilton campaign video responding john mccain
2714916 will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
2714917 there may be no corporation in america that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of americans more than wal mart
2714918 write to every member of congress declaring that any democrat receiving or keeping wal mart money can kiss any labor donations or labor support good bye
2714919 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
2714920 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
2714921 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
2714922 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
2714923 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2714924 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers
2714925 will defend their corporate right to speak but not mine nor that of any other independent journalist
2714926 there are many advantages of being printed by the sun
2714927 its big modern presses allow us to print six sections instead of four to print many more pages to have more color to print more quickly to do more zoning and to have better inserting

2714936 i have thought for years that the tram would never go ahead it was simply too expensive and too ambitious a project
2714937 all the time it remained a possibility it caused great anxiety to residents and businesses who saw their quality of life or livelihood at risk and prevented other solutions being looked at as all the energy was put into pro or anti tram campaigns
2714938 the whole sorry tale of the west london tram has been one of arrogance and a waste of money from the start
2714939 he admitted recently that this year will see total spending on the proposed tram scheme jump to 38million from 29million last year
2714940 mr livingstone is looking for a way out of the mess hes got himself into over the tram if he gets crossrail he can say hes pulled a rabbit out of the hat
2714941 if crossrail doesnt go ahead and the west london tram is brought back off the shelf then he can say he was forced into it by the prime minister gordon brown
2714942 a positive decision on crossrail will mean that substantially improved bus services become a practical alternative to a tram along the uxbridge road to meet the need for more public transport boost the local economy and to deal with rising congestion in the area
2714943 i am pleased that we have reached an agreement with ealing council to work together along these lines to deliver the best solution for people in this part of west london
2714944 the claim that crossrail as it is contained in the present crossrail bill in the uk house of commons is the right answer to the transport needs of london is a lie crossrail has never been the answer most serious students of economics have rejected the plug that crossrail is the panacea which ken livingstone has been claiming it to be crossrail is ill thought out it is wasteful already as a typical ken livingstone indulging g stunt at extra cost to ordinary people in london the craze that livingstone is undergoing for crossrail will explode in his face when it is shown up for the con that it is livingstone is not behaving rationally on this what a comment on a man who has made a career at the expense of the people of london by claiming to be rational the waste of money livingstone typifies must be stopped ordinary people of and in london cant wait to be able to have our say on platforms that the bureaucratized office of mayor is automatically granted
2714945 he has been in politics a while and he has made it his trade to make deals so many deals has he been involved in making that he has now lost track of which deals are his and which deals are enforced on him by his punters he is almost lost if not quote lost
2714946 potrika and bangla post been publishing the anodyne items about

2714967 since there is a limit on the number of students i can accept the concept of virtual teaching has helped me i now tell outstation students to opt for a virtual teaching session
2714968 the concept has found acceptance in the region in three months alone we have witnessed 100 per cent growth in the users all you need is a pc and a broadband connection and you can start your teaching session
2714969 the reach of virtual classrooms is phenomenal i can now sit anywhere in the world and conduct classes we do not have a physical institute teaching learning is only through the computer
2714970 people around the world are interested in upgrading their knowledge and virtual classrooms serves a perfect platform
2714971 as this is gaining acceptance we have decided to launch a premium service with a payment module for the sessions and advanced features wherein we will be featuring specialised teachers in each field
2714972 even though the idea is still in an incipient stage we in japan have already started poring over the indian elementary mathematic syllabi and plan to take concrete steps ahead in the matter
2714973 india has brought out iitians who are respected technocrats and sought after all over the world their foundation of mathematics is laid in the way they were taught during elementary schooling
2714974 mathematics is primarily a subject having its own unique numerical language just the basic knowledge of japanese is enough for teaching purposes at the primary level
2714975 it will not only help iron out the psychological barrier but also the language barrier if trade between the two countries has to flourish
2714976 i do not have more details on the issue but then it shows the kind of influence the indian educational system has in our country
2714977 since the 1980s and 90s there has been a sharp dip in mathematics education in japanese schools
2714978 after all india has right now the best it professionals
2714979 in recent years the japanese have made india synonymous with a one liner oh your country had discovered the concept of zero isnt it that is very true and a good sign of the high level academic excellence of our own teachers despite severe handicaps
2714980 however many others are keen to explore joint ventures in areas like city planning real estate rail network port development and infrastructure development specially in the delhi mumbai industrial corridor primary discussions have been conducted but the fact remains that the japanese certainly are among the best town planners in the world
2714981 vertically cross wise is the best because it is quicker than any other method when the numbers are near 10 or 100 etc then base is good but vertically and cross wise has its hand on everything
2714982 using vertically and crosswise we can do wonders in multiplying itz easy but other methods r too easy n wont help in most of d situations
2714983 wow kids loved it teachers loved it we want more
2714984 this event was a great success our students loved it and were quite addicted
2714985 it was a super experience for all the children involved the anticipation and tension in the school when two pupils were competing against each other was electrifying
2714986 the world maths day celebration in the school was a grand success the children enjoyed the quiz at their fullest it was an exciting event
2714987 i have never seen my children so keen to do mental maths sums what a brilliant event
2714988 weve used vedic mathematics to decrease the time taken to execute programming commands on a computer
2714989 an efficient binary mul tiplication algorithm based on vedic mathematics
2714990 weve used vedic maths to devise a dividend and a divisor using constants and variables to arrive upon quotients and remainders that further elucidate the algorithm for quicker computing
2714991 vedic mathematics calculations for certain programming com mands are less complex and dont require tables of numbers used
2714992 we want to come up with algorithms based on vedic mathematics for dedicated chips
2714993 fantastic interesting presentation really helpful tips to make calculatons easier
2714994 being a student of math i tremendously enjoyed your session your depth of the subject knowledge was indeed admirable and from what i had heard from others everyone absolutely appreciated your patience in dissipating the information at a level that even a 10 year old would understand after almost four hours of your time no one seemed to get bored or tired on behalf of the community i personally would like to thank you for your time and invite you now for another session the next time you visit your children finally if you could do me a favor i would like to get an autographed copy of your book it was an oversight on my part when you were here but you are not far away and i would like to get one if possible wish you the best on your journey back to mother india and please keep in touch
2714995 the survey shows how essential it is that the business community gets involved in tackling the problem
2714996 through the programme we aim to find a long tem solution spearheading resources of specially trained teachers to help the seven year olds who have the greatest difficulties with maths
2714997 this gives hindu parents a choice parents from other religions have a choice so its fair that the hindu parents too have an option
2714998 for me it is important that students eat only vegetarian food in the school and learn more about our culture in a western country the child will interact with the locals anyway so its important that he learns about our culture in someway or the other
2714999 the sutras of vedic mathematics are the software for the cosmic computer that runs this universe
2715000 is the mathematics of the absolute self referral field of pure consciousness where everything is simultaneous where everything is simultaneously administered on the level of perfect order
2715001 vedic mathematics is the structuring dynamics of natural law it spontaneously designs the source course and goal of natural law the orderly theme of evolution
2715002 the internet is one of the reasons why it has become so mainstream
2715003 students from all over the country are using it to help them in entrance examinations like the cat gmat sat
2715004 we see loads of books dvds online classes and even you tube videos on this subject
2715005 the vedic maths course is completely different from the iggsc board that they riddhi has in utpal sanghvi school
2715006 students are eager to learn vedic maths today as it is a simple way to solve mathematical problems
2715007 i am glad that people are slowly taking interest because given the state of education reforms in our country it would take at least 200 years before this system is implemented in the classroom we are still teaching children stuff which was relevant to the industrial age when people were needed to work in factories
2715008 i just never think about it that much i just do whatever do happy stuff
2715009 its fun if i didnt have it id probably sit around my house and do nothing
2715010 i just have a passion for being on stage and getting to perform for everyone
2715011 last year southeast ohio packed and shipped 13 821 boxes
2715012 this year we look forward to collecting well over 15 000 boxes
2715013 as a result doe has eliminated the project specific proposals for the siting construction and operation of a nuclear fuel recycling center an advanced recycling center and an advanced fuel cycle research facility
2715014 were not at the stage right now to pick a site
2715015 its all code language for saying that this isnt going to happen
2715016 the biggest issue is that gnep had lost a lot of its impetus within congress
2715017 the congresswomans position has been that she will do what the local community wants her to do if they want her to push for the consideration of this project then she will
2715018 congress has not provided much funding for this project so she has been focusing much of her attention on making sure the cleaning continues
2715019 there was a sense of uncertainty about it for some time
2715020 the governor did support the communitys efforts to attract this project but there were certain conditions that the community felt were necessary for the recycling plant they were seeking a commitment that this site would not become a nuclear dumping ground
2715021 the governor thinks that this location and the highly skilled work force in the area are great assets to the state
2715022 this administration is not going to figure out anything and all of this is going to be left to the next administration so all options are open
2715023 the prosecution chose to file three more charges against me one day before my scheduled trial
2715024 he will have an opportunity to defend himself at his own trial
2715025 the grand jury is not the place to defend yourself that is why a trial has been scheduled so he can defend himself against these charges
2715026 to protect the public from future offenses and adequately punish oros for the offenses but not for appealing any prior decision of the court
2715027 we had the event well covered and they had a great response they were really prepared
2715028 i just have a passion for being on stage and getting to perform for everyone

2715033 i said honey when youre in college you need to buy books and theyll still have a gameboy

2715038 cows i love them i know how to walk them theyre really nice to me
2715039 i love it because cows whenever they lay down you can hug them cows are cuddly
2715040 kids around here they need money so what else is there to do
2715041 the kids dont have parents watching them and they feel like they dont have any hope
2715042 its been historically a community thats been very hard for us to build inroads in
2715043 all i see is 4 year olds walking around holding hands with 7 year olds
2715044 theres nothing for me to do around here every corner is a drug corner
2715045 kids should try to stay away from that do something positive sell bottles of water or something anything
2715046 they walk around with their bellies pushing a stroller and they think its cute
2715047 we have to get in our cars so the kids can have everything their heart desires
2715048 i believe drug traffickers find fertile ground for their trade where you have depressed areas because poor people are desperate
2715049 theyre looking to put food on the table and unfortunately i believe thats whats happened in the whitman park neighborhood
2715050 city officials dont take advantage of positive organizations like ours
2715051 we operate out of a small storefront and we make miracles work
2715052 you wonder why the children dont have anywhere to go its political people down there in city hall who dont have vision
2715053 my understanding is that my client believes she is in compliance with the agreement
2715054 i think wed love to see it be zero but puppies are like babies and at times can get sick
2715055 thats why we have a puppy lemon law and thats why we support it
2715056 clearly there is no follow up and the consent decree is meaningless
2715057 we tried to put them out of business in 1997 but the court ruled against us
2715058 if there are violations of the consent petition we will file a contempt petition and ask the court to provide sanctions and if we have the grounds to shut them down we will ask the court to do so
2715059 the only thing that is acceptable to our family is that you have the kennel shut down
2715060 out of an abundance of caution on the chance that anyone could get sick
2715061 through this legislation the department of health will have an early warning when a hospital becomes fiscally unstable and will be able to intervene before the fiscal instability gives way to fiscal insolvency and yet another health care facility in the garden state has to close its doors forever
2715062 just something so ordinary about it so no nonsense and no pretense about it
2715063 i want you whatll it take for you to surrender i gave you a taste oh how youve grown this great trial this self denial its a trial to leave you clean cause i like it dark and low you know

2715169 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2715170 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2715171 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2715172 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2715173 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2715174 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2715175 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2715176 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2715257 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2715258 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2715259 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2715260 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2715261 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2715262 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2715263 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2715264 should talk to the american people and talk to the world
2715265 i would be very direct with president putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct

2715373 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2715374 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory

2715382 i concealed my other stuff behind the tent and put on a cap and stood in the midst of the western climbers i saw chinese troops shooting at the tibetans all were running as fast as they could in the snow and no body tried to fight back
2715383 it was so tense and confusing that i just thought of staying alive and escaping i couldnt think of anything else or help the others
2715384 i think the chinese fired for about 15 minutes i felt bullets whizzing past my ears in fact i felt about five bullets pass by me and luckily they missed me i was so frightened that i crawled in the snow using my hands and feet the snow was about knee deep

2715405 i liken them to favorite children you never get tired of trotting out your kids when they do well at something youre really proud of it
2715406 there are a lot of people who were fans when they were little kids theyve grown up and are bringing their kids and women are bringing their husbands
2715407 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2715408 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2715409 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2715410 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts

2715413 the russian side has not hit any settlements we have no right to attack civilian positions
2715414 we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side

2715416 er wollte in einem gro en land leben und vielleicht ber hmt werden wie es aussieht ist er das jetzt
2715417 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2715418 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2715419 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2715420 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2715421 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home

2715428 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
2715429 were not wearing apparel that identified them as members of the u s delegation at the time of the attack
2715430 its far too early to suggest that this has anything to do with the olympics taking place
2715431 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2715432 im really shocked to hear there has been an attack here
2715433 here in beijing is very safe i have been walking outside at 3 a m you never see anything like this maybe this is related with the olympics i didnt expect anything like this it is shocking
2715434 i doubt they would have said anything at all if it didnt involve foreigners
2715435 such things are very unusual not just in this area but all of beijing i am shocked i am very shocked this is tragic
2715436 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2715437 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2715438 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2715439 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2715440 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
2715441 at this point i think it is reasonable to say that tomorrow probably will come and go without that happening
2715442 we need to have a strong verification regime before we can take action on removing the north koreans from the state sponsors of terrorism list

2715447 the bachmans were wonderful volleyball fans bachman mccutcheon was a wonderful volleyball player
2715448 they were great followers and great supporters i think the only way we can honor them at this juncture the only thing we can do is go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball
2715449 it is a game and we should be playing it and loving it and enjoying this the way they did

2715456 you guys there is no reason you should not have these finished
2715457 now if you dont turn them in you are not getting a grade
2715458 so how many went to the visiting artist lecture on thursday
2715459 so what did you think i would love to hear your feedback
2715460 it was really great to see how he uses his art to bring awareness to the viewer
2715461 i knew him when he was a student and was forced to make pure abstract painting and then i just opened up the door for him and how im so great and i was so contemporary and wonderful at this stuffy conservative college and they only talked about composition and not in anyway about content and that gave him something to fight against and you dont really have anything to fight against at this school because our faculty are just so great and open and understanding and when i was at this school i accidentally outed this guy who was painting drag queens because i asked him are these drag queens or prostitute youre gay right in class and i guess no one knew and i sparked this great controversy and isnt controversy just so great for art and what are you knitting there
2715462 i thought so its just so tiny i mean you must have some really small calves
2715463 well ill have to look this artist up because ive never heard of him
2715464 hes kind of interesting ive never seen his work before
2715465 his work has become a fairly popular icon that many larger corporations rip off ive even seen it used in commercials and a similar style used for different publications not to mention the features in art magazines like juxtapose
2715466 well there is a lot of work out there like this its not like hes the first one to use the painting technique where you think it looks like one thing but is really another its called tromp loeil
2715467 well im just saying that hes not the only one who has done work like this
2715468 well im just saying that he is so popular and his work has been taken out of context and onto tv which you said you watched a ridiculous amount of this weekend and im surprised you had never seen his work before especially since it is in just about every standard issue contemporary art history text
2715469 there are two reasons why there is silence about work because it is fully resolved and the artist is doing what they have proposed to do or because the work has completely missed its mark and the artist has as well what do you think it is why are you all so silent
2715470 well her work is amazing weve heard her speak on it there is nothing she has not thought of and we are all just anticipating the completed work we do not know of anything that could help
2715471 well i guess we have finished for the class now next week ill want you to all have the next part of the survey finished there will be parts that you will have to actually make as well things you will have to physically do like one is to reinvent the rainbow
2715472 you know i really think that sometimes in an art school there is too much focus on art we all know that you are inspired and look at other artists we all know the history of it what about whats going on out there what about life life is such a greater subject than art will ever be
2715473 the first in the family to finish high school and college

2715561 all of my followers will enter paradise except those who refuse
2715562 he who obeys me enters paradise and he who disobeys me has refused
2715563 tabarruj by displaying beautification is showing off to strangers and this is disliked
2715564 i give my acknowledgement that you must not set partners to worship besides allaah that you do not steal commit fornication or adultery that you do not kill your child that you do not commit any falsehood before your hands and between your legs that you do not wail and that you do not make tabarruj like that of jahiliyyah pre islamic era
2715565 there shall be in the later part of my nation women who are dressed but are in fact naked on their heads are humps like those of camels curse them for they are surely cursed
2715566 of the people of hell there are two types whom i have never seen the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox and they flog people with them the second one the women who would be naked in spite of their being dressed who are seduced to wrong paths and seduce others with their hair high like humps these women would not get into paradise and they would not perceive its odour although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance
2715567 the parable of a woman who moves with a slow sweeping motion trailing her beautified clothes performing not for her husband is like darkness of the day of judgement she has or comes with no light
2715568 its meaning is correct because the enjoyment in disobedience is in fact torture and suffering the meaning is that this type of woman will come on the day of resurrection black in darkness as if she physically originated from darkness in contrast what happens to be difficult and painful in performance of obedient acts is a true enjoyment because of the reward awaiting those who are obedient to allaah and his messenger sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam
2715569 the best of your women is the affectionate the fertile in productivity the propitious favourable the consultative if they fear allaah the most evil of your women are the mutabarrijat those who do at tabarruj display their beauty the mutakhayelat who strut swagger and they are the hypocrites those who enter al jannah the paradise are like the cough crow
2715570 any woman who takes of her clothes in other than her husbands home has broken the shield between her and allaah
2715571 the saying of the prophet sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam any woman who takes of her clothes in other than her husbands home means showing off her beauty to strangers by taking off her shield of clothes she has broken the shield between her and allaah subhaanahu wa taaala
2715572 and when they commit a faahisha evil deed going round the kabah in naked state every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse etc they say we found our fathers doing it and allaah has commanded us of it say nay allaah never commands of faahisha do you say of allaah what you know not
2715573 shaytaan satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit fahshaa evil deeds illegal sexual intercourse sins etc whereas allaah promises you forgiveness from himself and bounty and allaah is all sufficient for his creatures needs all knower
2715574 verily those who like that the crime of illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe they will have a painful torment in this world and in the hereafter and allaah knows and you know not
2715575 o children of adam we have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves screen your private parts etc and as an adornment and the raiment of righteousness that is better
2715576 i have not left after me any chance of turmoil more harmful to men than the harm done to them because of women
2715577 watch out for this worldly life safeguard yourself from its temptation guard yourself from the allurement of women verily the first trial for the people of israel was caused by women
2715578 moreover the lord said because the daughters of zion are proud and walk with heads held high and seductive eyes and go along with mincing steps and tinkle the bangles on their feet therefore the lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of zion with scabs and the lord will make their foreheads bare
2715579 in that day the lord will take away the beauty of their anklets headbands crescent ornaments dangling earrings bracelets veils headdresses ankle chains sashes perfume boxes amulets finger rings nose rings festal robes outer tunics cloaks money purses hand mirrors undergarments turbans and veils
2715580 you will tread the same path as was trodden by those before you inch by inch and step by step so that if they enter the hole of the lizard you will follow them into it also
2715581 and whoever contradicts and opposes the messenger muhammad after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers way we shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in hell what an evil destination
2715582 and stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance
2715583 he allows them as lawful at taiyibaat i e all good and lawful as regards things deeds beliefs persons foods etc and prohibits them as unlawful i e all evil and unlawful as regards things deeds beliefs persons foods etc
2715584 sin did not spread in any particular nation until they openly conducted their sins and as a result plague and other illnesses that were not present amongst their predecessors because present amongst them
2715585 and when we decide to destroy a town population we first send a definite order to obey allaah and be righteous to those among them or we first increase in number those of its population who are given the good things of this life then they transgress therein and thus the word of torment is justified against it them then we destroy it with complete destruction
2715586 when people see wrong or evil and they dont change it then it is eminent that the punishment of allaah will fall upon them

2715602 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2715603 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2715604 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2715605 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2715606 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2715607 we picked some white heather from the roadside on the way up which i had with me in the car and ill be taking it to the next round the merrick stages as well
2715608 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2715612 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2715613 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2715614 the goal is to combine artificial intelligence with the latest advanced graphics and video game type technology to enable us to create historical archives of people beyond what can be achieved using traditional technologies such as text audio and video footage
2715615 the technology we are developing isnt going to magically map memories and personalities
2715616 there is a lot of work to be done but one can envision given sufficient computing power and information hat one can produce highly realistic characters
2715617 it encourages people to think about different ways in which they can communicate and interact with computers for example right now many computers have built in web cams most of them are turned off unless they are being used for videoconferencing but imagine if the camera were active all the time and the computer was watching and listening to you as you work just like an assistant or a secretary it could use that information to provide you with assistance if it sees that you are frustrated human to human communication has evolved and matured over several millennia but humans have really only learned to communicate with computers in the last 50 years
2715618 in our efforts to capture the past by digitizing historical artifacts using some of the most advanced imaging technology available today weve forgotten to turn that imaging technology inwards and try and capture the original creators of those historical artifacts

2715649 black diamonds are starting to feel the pinch of the credit meltdown
2715650 there has been a rapid increase since february and march
2715651 we have to move fast and make space for new vehicles
2715652 i started defaulting after my child unexpectedly fell ill and i had to fork out extra money for his medical costs things went downhill after that
2715653 the information we receive indicates that people with home loans from r2 million to r5 million were the worst affected
2715654 these people have accumulated a string of expensive assets and are now finding it hard to maintain their lifestyles
2715655 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger they need to succeed
2715656 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
2715657 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2715658 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the european cup
2715659 it doesnt matter that manchester united beat us in the last match they are different games they need different approaches
2715660 weve had good preparation for the pre season and now we really want to win this first match at wembley
2715661 they are a very good side but i believed we would win the fa cup if i didnt believe it i would not play football you cannot just give up
2715662 i have great memories of that day scoring the winner against chelsea im really looking forward to sunday

2715664 the message was that dont say i dont want to serve when it suited you because on other occasions you give an impression that you accept deployment it was a matter of reminding them of party discipline which i think is fair
2715665 that is why there has not been any minister announcing his or her retirement
2715666 the advice was to all cadres of the movement who are in government that they can be retained or redeployed they shouldnt make announcements that are not in line with the ancs policies all cadres are eligible for the party nomination list
2715667 the anc is quite right in saying they have the authority to deploy members to various positions of cabinet as far as i am aware theres not a single branch of the anc throughout the country that has proposed me to be on the nec list my position remains the same that i will not be available for cabinet positions

2715676 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions
2715677 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions
2715678 all praises are due to allah we praise him seek his help and ask for his forgiveness we seek refuge in allah from the evil in our souls and from our sinful deeds whoever allah guides no one can mislead whoever allah leads astray no one can guide i bear witness that there is no one worthy of worship except allah i also bear witness that muhammad is his servant and messenger

2715681 we have verified information that the russians are planning to attack zugdidi in several hours
2715682 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2715683 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2715684 this is definitely necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea
2715685 a sea blockade of georgia will also help avert an escalation of military activity in abkhazia
2715686 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them

2715694 you have a fine way of setting aside the commands of god in order to observe a your own
2715695 it was quite a composed row and we know that the germans are unbeaten in the olympic games in the womens quad so we knew how they would be
2715696 we have to be happy to come back from being three goals down against one of the best teams in the world
2715697 this is a recurring theme with us we take a 3 4 goal lead then ease up before breaking the opponent
2715698 but its quite something we could bring this back for a tie and i think well grow stronger by each game
2715699 i think the main thing was defensively we played pretty well
2715700 we had a couple of lapses where we kind of let them get back into the game but we had four quarters of good defenses and thats what its going to take to beat some of these better teams
2715701 i was back at 1030 if somebody says you cant go to the opening ceremony because you will get tired it doesnt make sense
2715702 i slept for six hours before my race that is fair enough
2715703 this is my first olympics performance wise i am not expecting much because i am inexperienced and have to learn so many things from the top guys
2715704 so i thought maybe i should enjoy this olympics and maybe i can miss the opening ceremony of the london olympics in 2012

2715708 i dont want to bother them too much but i want to get as many photos as possible and meet them all it is a once in a lifetime experience

2715717 if this unethical behaviour by microsoft was not sufficiently despicable they did the unthinkable by involving politics in what should have been a technical evaluation of the standard by writing to the head of the malaysian standards organization and getting its business partners to engage in a negative letter writing campaign to indicate lack of support of odf in the malaysian market
2715718 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
2715719 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses

2715722 if im to give a grade for todays performance id give it 70 percent
2715723 because one of our major goals today qualifying two top gymnasts on uneven bars is in limbo right now our chances are no longer in our hands but depend entirely on how others perform later on in the day of course wed much prefer to qualify based on our own absolute ability and not on relative ability compared to others not have to depend on others underperforming but problems arose on bars
2715724 our performance in the first two events beam and floor was great
2715725 especially beam the first event was the one wed worried the most about but our gymnasts gave their maximum effort there we put in a lot of preparation on that event ever since first hearing about the bad draw of first subdivision beam first
2715726 especially since everything before the fall was superb and shed already nailed the difficult parts of the routine the part where she made the error was not a high difficulty component of her routine
2715727 in actual competition anything unexpected can happen youve completed the high difficulty parts of the routine then on the minor low difficulty details problems can occur i think it has to do with a lack of major competition experience
2715728 as a young gymnast deng linlin gave a superb complete performance today
2715729 she hit all three events we relied on her for and got the job done on two events floor and bars she was the lead off gymnast bars in particular were a major test for her because we didnt intend on putting up that many gymnasts for the event deng linlin nailing her bars first up was critical to us today deng linlins bars and li shanshans bars both wont be usable for team finals but for preliminaries because deng as the lead off gymnast hit her routine successfully we could do without li shanshan going up on bars as the fifth gymnast if deng didnt succeed on bars our later line up would be affected and li shanshan would have to do bars

2715930 that very evening we had arranged to see our architect who has been busy preparing some plans for redeveloping our building
2715931 it is quite extraordinary that on the day we were making steps towards redeveloping the site the oldest part of our building which would probably be the first part of any redevelopment caught fire
2715932 we may not hes got priorities and needs to take care of those things
2715933 obviously hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2715934 you know what ive got this happening here right now but we need to complete what we started out here

2715947 ich erhoffe mir dass mein trainerstab und ich dass wir unsere handschrift kenntlich machen k nnen

2715959 ai confini della terra nella continuit di una tradizione vitale
2715960 e ormai prossimo il momento di lasciare questa bella terra dove mi sono sentito come a casa sia per la familiarit dei luoghi che per lospitalit della gente
2715961 sono grato al signore che mi ha concesso questa sosta ristoratrice per il fisico e per lo spirito
2715962 ho potuto riposare nel modo che meglio si addice a un ministro di dio dedicandomi alla preghiera alla lettura e alla meditazione senza lassillo delle quotidiane urgenze pastorali
2715963 this is what i have dreamed of since i was 11 years old
2715964 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2715965 i came over the line and there was so much i was just so happy and there were so many emotions that were coming out all at once
2715966 i made so much noise because i guess thats just the person i am
2715967 i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy
2715968 i dont think it has sunk in yet i still feel like the normal nicole from before the race but its just so exciting emma pooley who played a crucial pacemaking role in cookes gold medal bid came 23rd while the third member of the british team sharon laws finished in 35th we all knew that we were good riders but the best chance that we had was to ride as a team
2715969 emma was going for her own bid for glory but it meant that i could ride defensively and also save myself i think it put the other teams on the back foot
2715970 emma and sharon did an awesome job in supporting nicole in her race for gold
2715971 what you cant perhaps quite sense at home is just the torrential rain that was falling on beijing and despite those incredibly tough weather conditions she won so its a wonderful victory and a huge lift for team gb
2715972 this is a great start to the beijing olympics for team gb and i have no doubt this medal will fire up the rest of the team to do their best in the next two weeks
2715973 well done to nicole cooke she has set us on our way
2715974 normally im good in the rain but the problem was that it was really cold
2715975 i was due to attend greyfriars police station today to answer bail regarding my arrest on suspicion of stirring up racial hatred th

2715979 was a motivator for us to move more quickly in putting the new system in place
2715980 i think students will find it easier to use at their houses
2715981 should not be used as financial account numbers and in cases where it is used that way today a plan should be developed to adopt an alternative approach as soon as possible
2715982 this is rectifying if you will or recognizing a situation that probably should have changed a long time ago
2715983 after teaching for eight years a professor is usually reviewed for tenure or not
2715984 but ali has been teaching with so many responsibilities for so long
2715985 after all these years theyve decided to put me up for full professorship
2715986 the last time our two departments reviewed it the contract we said this is crazy
2715987 he has written more taught with more effectiveness than most of the people in our departments and the basis that he is staying here needs to change
2715988 for the first time in the creation of this chair harvard recognizes the importance of studying islam outside the middle east
2715989 in these and other leadership roles he has emerged over the course of his distinguished career as one of the most thoughtful insightful and eloquent exponents of the power of public health to change lives for the better
2715990 he has remained closely engaged with the academy including the hsph and has played a vital role at the crossroads of academic research and practice
2715991 for me its all grounded in my firm belief that science and scholarship not economic interest or short term political gain that will make the world a better place
2715992 i believe in dialogue in listening so that i can understand better the challenges and needs of faculty and students
2715993 i think the thing that is probably unique about him more than anyone else is that he has served successfully in public health global health and as an administrator
2715994 in each he has had a vision that has transformed the world
2715995 with the economy falling i suppose it will get a lot of interest
2715996 i think probably the biggest lesson was the importance of having around one table a team that understands all of those sometimes competing but important to integrate dictates
2715997 it was a very important process to take those lessons and bring them with me here
2715998 im a big believer in loyalty and the clintons gave me a tremendous and life changing opportunity in the early 90s
2715999 with the proven energy savings and the continual increases in energy costs were able to reallocate the savings to full time professors and keeping our tuition affordable to students
2716000 bcc will be looked on as an innovator because we have become known for starting this in this area and having it work out for both the students and the staff
2716001 if you dont know what your employees are doing you shouldnt be managing and obviously he wasnt managing
2716002 i hire capable competent people to do their work its virtually impossible to know what decisions each of those individuals are making on a daily basis
2716003 i think he did what he felt was the right thing
2716004 the office seems to have lost its way with limited oversight of employees and a breakdown in the checks and balances needed to ensure a fair and equitable appraisal process
2716005 i dont see how anyone can have any faith in the office right now its going to take a lot of work to restore the publics trust in that office
2716006 the inappropriate activity that took place in the property appraisers office was allowed to occur and ford did not take any responsible action to correct it on his own
2716007 this office and every property appraisers office in this state adjusts values in properties when its determined the taxpayer has a valid point and the value is wrong
2716008 if theres six theres likely to be 60 it depends on how far prosecutors want to look
2716009 they should pursue not only public officials but those who benefited
2716010 we are always looking for top locations that make us more convenient to our customers
2716011 for 10 million they could buy the real estate and build a new store from the ground up
2716012 we understand that people are feeling the crunch of the economy and we are always trying to find ways to save customers money so what you will see is weve lowered prices on items that customers use the most
2716013 we dont claim to have the biggest stores or the lowest prices our position in the market is very simple high quality and great service
2716014 while its traditionally true that food is the last place consumers cut back they can and sometimes do have to cut back when times get tough
2716015 wal mart right now seems to be positioned pretty well as consumers trade down and look around for value
2716016 with the economy so bad we need all the help we can get especially with more than one
2716017 very limited i dont think i would have bought anything until after school started
2716018 our goal is to provide the basics for students who are most in need so that theyre not the kid who came to school with absolutely nothing
2716019 and we have some parents who are so thrilled because theyve never been able to afford going to the zoo
2716020 i just know when hearts come together as one for an intention it does make a difference in the world and thats why im here
2716021 it cuts across all common space and creates healing and thats all we can ask for is healing in that situation
2716022 i want to let you know that if youre a drug dealer in here you just kill like the murderers killing the community its not the white man thats killing you its the foolish negroes just like you
2716023 i have a son that looks up to you all to do the right things
2716024 please please please dont let these funerals be in vain

2716029 we have to see what the people want and that doesnt happen until november
2716030 if the amendment passes you have to take a course of action but lets not prejudge the people in their wisdom
2716031 fifteen years ago florida voters who were a little confused tended to vote no
2716032 nowadays it seems floridians are very likely to say yes
2716033 we took the call seriously and diverted patients from the emergency room which is self contained
2716034 we had evac transport patients to other hospitals we did have a couple people show up with chest pains and we screened them and got them in quickly
2716035 you dont pay your professional staff at a rate you would pay the average resident you pay them for the expertise of dealing with aging and deteriorating infrastructure
2716036 if this is truly a representative government there should not be a superior class of people with a much higher standard of living than all the people paying their salaries
2716037 some specializations are scarce enough to require higher salaries however under best practices any organization unit needs to take a look at its fraction of the budget devoted to salary because if theyre devoting more than a commensurate amount they need to take a fresh look

2716041 miss hucks had been a person of exceptional finesse and that makes it all the more tragic what happened to her on the beach
2716042 she always had makeup and lipstick she was very ladylike
2716043 it haunted her mother for years all you had to do was look at her to tell something was missing
2716044 i dont know of anything more cold blooded or premeditated

2716058 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2716059 maybe thats why it hurts so much it hit so close
2716060 we will have to seek how to deal with the amarnath land issue we will definitely make efforts that it is resolved in a manner in which it does not hurt the sentiments of people of jammu as well as people of kashmir
2716061 we will compensate the near and dear ones of those who have been killed
2716062 we will prepare a comprehensive and solid chargesheet that musharraf will not be able to fight it it is very necessary that he resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start

2716065 police sealed my house at nigeen as well as mirwaiz manzil at rajouri kadal where a meeting of the coordination committee was going on regarding muzaffarabad challo programme
2716066 the pdp has decided to join the march to muzaffarabad on monday the call for which has been given by fruit growers association
2716067 the march should be seen as the assertion of kashmirs inalienable right to trade and travel without restrictions
2716068 we will have to seek how to deal with the amarnath land issue we will definitely make efforts that it is resolved in a manner which does not hurt the sentiments of people of jammu as well as people of kashmir
2716069 the prime minister has also said that it should continue as in the past
2716070 there should be no communalisation of the situation there have been some incidents but we will tackle these
2716071 media can also make mistakes we request you to see what is covered is fact and done in a manner that it does not hurt sentiments of people
2716072 flushing occurs because the vasomotor system the part of the brain that controls temperature in the body dilates your vessels veins and arteries to give the blood a bigger surface area and therefore cool it down
2716073 its called vasodilation and thats why you go red theres a bigger blood flow around the body
2716074 you flush if youre embarrassed as neurotransmitters in your brain signal this emotion and that causes the central nervous system to produce chemicals which make the vessels dilate
2716075 the hormone oestrogen regulates the hypothalamus which is the heat stabilisation centre in the brain so when your oestrogen is low it can cause hot flushes

2716104 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2716105 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2716106 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2716107 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2716108 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2716109 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2716110 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2716111 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2716155 and you can put away the gun im sure it wont hurt me
2716156 there is a limit to the amount of weird stuff a woman can handle in a night dont you think ive already reached mine
2716157 who or what are you why are you here why didnt you just come through the window like any respectable monster am i going crazy why tonight
2716158 i am called by many names you may call me vitrolo i am a vampire as if you didnt know im here to warn you i cant enter a home unless invited to come in and im not a monster you are not going crazy it took us a very long time to find you
2716159 you are the ugliest vampire ive ever seen i wont call you anything i cant spell exactly what kind of danger you are a monster i am going crazy if im actually having this conversation and who is us
2716160 call me anything you wish then if i told you what kind of danger you wouldnt believe me anyway i come from my mistress laoiwana i can tell you how to spell it if you dont know she kind of insists we call her by it being four thousand years old has its perks
2716161 and you are a monster just for your information i should know ive written enough about your kind
2716162 a very nasty person is trying to get to you she wants your heart in as many little pieces as possible since all of us know and like you we decided to give you a heads up warning but dont come crying oh vitrolo no i believe now when it does happen if you laugh at this warning
2716163 but i am not going to take this warning seriously until you tell me who it is thats after me and why and how the hell you all know about me
2716164 okay youve warned me i turned it down you can go now
2716165 then tomorrow i go and invest in some nice wooden stakes holy water and about fifty gallons of acid
2716166 not even a goodbye i was only joking about the holy water im not sure i could even touch the stuff safely
2716167 i am your friend but do you see how easy it would be for someone to attack you and harm you
2716168 remember how easy it would be and remember us call my name and ill be here im not the dangerous one lucky for you
2716169 okay guys i dont know what you are doing here but i really just need some rest perhaps you could come back tomorrow ill set up an appointment just call my secretary
2716170 youve got this all wrong even if i could which i cant i wouldnt know how i wouldnt know how to begin
2716171 i really dont know what you are talking about i cant do it
2716172 the queen of fae is refused by no one woman i will have what i want or i will rip your heart out while you watch
2716173 if you do not agree to write the story now
2716174 i will take you back to my world where alicia
2716175 will make you wish i had only ripped your heart out
2716176 we cant have your kind coming in and ruining this world too
2716177 wrong aphasia i cant kill you in this world i can make you wish you were dead i could make you eat my flesh and watch you gag as you consume dead rotting meat night after night
2716178 i will have her even if i have to kill you first
2716179 exactly who was that and what is this all about
2716180 that was aphasia queen of the fae people she wants you
2716181 im slow fang face but not that slow i figured that out already but who is she and why does she want me
2716182 shes from another world one that bridges ours she wants in we want to keep her out
2716183 the written word is very powerful it brings life to things that were not there before it strengthens belief in things that cannot be seen it confirms the things that can be seen like gods all fantasy creatures need to be believed in on some level of written language to exist if they arent then they cease to be
2716184 so let her get someone else to believe in her
2716185 besides ive read books on faeries before ive never read a book about those kinds of faeries
2716186 once in a while about every hundred years or so there comes someone with a gift to create something from nothing by way of written words you have that talent if you were to write a story with those faeries they would be able to come into this world and multiply freely
2716187 so i can just write about anything and it will happen
2716188 you can create things not shape time or circumstance for instance if you write about something that already exists in this world such as vampires or werewolves all you would do is strengthen us but if you were to write about something completely new such as a five legged cat that can read minds it would come to be it would be the only one of its kind though and it would perish soon after unless millions read your story and believed in it with you
2716189 if you were to write about something that did exist on another world that mirrors ours all you would do is create a portal from that world to here that is what aphasia wants you to do
2716190 so im the only one who can do this why now why not when i first started writing
2716191 it took us years of searching for you and we knew what to look for
2716192 aphasia had to search too and she wasnt as sure of what to look for we knew the signs and yet still only barely beat her to you
2716193 what happens if i just go ahead and write this stupid story wont that get her off my back
2716194 the name i had in life so i take in this half life
2716195 easy guys i was just joking about the stupid story no way could i do that i was born in this world i dont want to see it ruined
2716196 he doesnt understand why we must stop aphasia at all cost but i have seen through my mistress what damage she will wreak your world will be consumed by her before she seeks another home hatred anger and bitterness are her only gifts torture fear and pain are her only allies
2716197 but my mistress was created as was every true master vampire there are those writers that are strong enough to allow us to make others but none that can create as you do
2716198 but there are faeries in this world good ones completely unlike the fae queen
2716199 yes faeries that were created a long time ago by another such as you are but that creator made them good not evil like the fae queen wanted this time i think she will be much more careful with her demands
2716200 what do i have to do write you a healthy arm
2716201 killing humans only happens in the movies or if we get to careless i can only take what i need i can even make it very pleasant for you
2716202 no tricks except for what i am what i really am
2716203 he didnt i could feel it you could feel it too wolf the whole room was vibrating with her energy
2716204 only once in a thousand years does a vampire of my strength meet a mortal whom he cannot control the touch with
2716205 do not offer me that again unless you want to be a vampire forever
2716206 how did she get to be an author of vampire and werewolf stories and not know about garlic or the touch someday ive got to read your work
2716207 the touch is what they use to make you enjoy being an appetizer
2716208 instead of me controlling you you managed to overwhelm me
2716209 if it werent for morden youd be one of us now a vampire with your ability forever
2716210 probably late you slept a long time i thought you were dead
2716211 of course the naked part i dont even know your names
2716212 the naked part means very little to us i assumed you would be more comfortable so after morden left i undressed you and my name is sylvi
2716213 one bite from a vampire and a glance at our um gifted leader could not make you a tramp
2716214 you are either already a tramp or you are not
2716215 im guessing one maybe two two men could not make you a tramp so there you go you are not one so finish dressing and get something to eat you look like vitrolos plaything already
2716216 vitrolo cant stand the light so hes hiding in a cave somewhere while we stand guard
2716217 just didnt want him barging in and interrupting us talking
2716218 last night was a night of many firsts for me in a thousand years it seems
2716219 i have fought her twice before and yet she has never sank a wound so deep as last night she is stronger now which means you must be close to writing of her i must stop you before that happens
2716220 what if something happens and i have to write about her
2716221 then each of my vampires will risk their lives as undead to kill you
2716222 you know i liked you better when you were all fun and games
2716223 i will tell you a joke then before i kill you
2716224 are you sure you do not wish to become a vampire rachel
2716225 ahh i see well if you ever get tired of running with morden look me up i will be happy to have you ill save a place for you
2716226 they like us cant come in without permission from you i dont want you to speak or move your head no matter what okay
2716227 my people and i will scout out around and see you stay here with her and guard her with your death
2716228 raaachel i know you are in there come out come out come out and plaaay theres someone out here who wants to play but he cant at the moment hes all tied up
2716229 oh dont you worry you know what i want and i know what you want
2716230 i knew you would see things my way dear sweet rachel no one refuses me for long you know
2716231 i will kill her before you can get what you want
2716232 my darling come to me i will protect you from those horrible monsters you have nothing to fear from us as long as i get what i want
2716233 of course after you finish your nice little story about me
2716234 release him or it never gets written if you harm him ill find a way to kill myself before i ever write another word
2716235 write the story or not only does he die but i make sure you live a long life in my dungeons
2716236 release him and i promise i will write your story about you and your evil friends
2716237 im sorry but ive got to do it for him
2716238 oh yes of course you do we understand dont we girls
2716239 finish it now and i will release all of them for you
2716240 my dad always said youre going to play in the big leagues some day
2716241 i pooh poohed that i would be like aw dad please dont say that source www sportsline comcc hopes third time is charm in title game corpus christi callerlake charles la for the third straight year the corpus christi hammerheads read more
2716242 this is what i have dreamed of since i was 11 years old
2716243 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2716244 i came over the line and there was so much i was just so happy and there were so many emotions that were coming out all at once
2716245 i made so much noise because i guess thats just the person i am
2716246 i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy
2716247 i dont think it has sunk in yet i still feel like the normal nicole from before the race but its just so exciting emma pooley who played a crucial pacemaking role in cookes gold medal bid came 23rd while the third member of the british team sharon laws finished in 35th we all knew that we were good riders but the best chance that we had was to ride as a team
2716248 emma was going for her own bid for glory but it meant that i could ride defensively and also save myself i think it put the other teams on the back foot
2716249 emma and sharon did an awesome job in supporting nicole in her race for gold
2716250 what you cant perhaps quite sense at home is just the torrential rain that was falling on beijing and despite those incredibly tough weather conditions she won so its a wonderful victory and a huge lift for team gb
2716251 this is a great start to the beijing olympics for team gb and i have no doubt this medal will fire up the rest of the team to do their best in the next two weeks
2716252 well done to nicole cooke she has set us on our way
2716253 normally im good in the rain but the problem was that it was really cold

2716267 weve pretty much given up on the idea of issuing any kind of statement at this point
2716268 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2716269 from a legal point of view russias actions in south ossetia are totally legitimate
2716270 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal rights and interests of other people

2716309 we have a lot of colleges and universities in pittsburgh
2716310 we might not be coming across a ton of macs right now but were steadily seeing more and we needed to be proactive
2716311 its not like we get a mac and say oh well guess we cant do anything with this one
2716312 we will get into the computer it just might take us longer id like to see us be more efficient about it every time we get a mac we have to go looking for help
2716313 its easier to articulate something if youve actually used it
2716314 if a defense attorney brings a mac computer into court and tells me to go to the my documents folder and i cant do it what does that make me look like as an investigator its important to stay on top of all technology especially if its becoming more popular and mac computers are

2716337 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2716338 the point here is that the primary tumour was treated
2716339 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2716340 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true sceptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2716341 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you

2716366 ellos nos defendieron muy bien nos obligaron a tomar tiros desde posiciones inc modas y f jate que apenas tiramos para un 23 por ciento desde tres puntos
2716367 desde antes de venir a beijing lo hab a dicho lituania es un buen equipo que tiene muchas posibilidades de quedarse con una medalla
2716368 hoy no fue mi d a nada me sali bien
2716369 encore un grand merci pour cette espace gratuit qui ma permis d largir mon champs de contact et de mamener de nouveaux contrats certains de mes morceaux vont tre jou s en espagne en floride dautres seront diffus s dans un court m trage au qu bec
2716370 creo que fue superior a mi rival que no hizo nada de boxeo se limit a agarrarme y no dejar que pele ramos
2716371 no perd el combate simplemente mi rival se dedic a agarrarme todo el tiempo
2716372 no se gana descalificando a la otra sino porque objetivamente es la mejor
2716373 sabemos que conseguir unos juegos no es descalificando al adversario lo vamos a conseguir no porque lo hagan mal los dem s que no lo van a hacer ni porque argumentemos elementos negativos sino porque objetivamente es la mejor
2716374 hay dos formas de llegar una mirando a la meta que es lo que hacemos nosotros o mirando a un lado y a otro al adversario con lo que se pierden unas mil simas que son muy importantes y que te pueden hacer perder la carrera
2716375 podemos aprender mucho de estos juegos y hay diferentes elementos que vamos a incorporarlos a nuestra candidatura como una villa ol mpica mucho m s amable un concepto de ecolog a m s sostenible y mayor inversi n en tecnolog a
2716376 madrid tiene factores climatol gicos muy favorables y los resultados de este informe los vamos a incorporar al dossier de candidatura para que los miembros del coi sepan que si apuestan por madrid el clima va a ser un c mplice activo del xito de los juegos
2716377 los xitos del deporte espa ol son muy buenos para nosotros porque llegan a la familia deportiva internacional y en una clave de mensaje muy positivo
2716378 soy voluntarista y por lo tanto optimista con respecto a la actuaci n de espa a en pek n donde se pueden superar cotas hist ricas de medallas como fue barcelona
2716379 salimos al campo muy nerviosos y todo nos sali mal el servicio la recepci n el bloqueo no conseguimos apenas jugar en los dos primeros sets y de ah nuestra derrota
2716380 pr cticamente hab amos perdido el partido y entonces los jugadores se soltaron y empezaron a mostrar nuestras virtudes la consigna era jugar con tranquilidad y disfrutar del momento y de la alegr a que es estar disputando unos juegos ol mpicos pero no pudimos con los nervios
2716381 podemos meternos en los cruces jap n china y nosotros estamos al mismo nivel y los tres un poco por debajo del resto italia rusia y bulgaria eso quiere decir que uno de los tres que he citado primero se va a meter en los cruces y espero que seamos nosotros
2716382 esta derrota tan ajustada ante la actual campeona de la liga mundial nos va a dar moral para intentar conseguir nuestro objetivo
2716383 salimos fuera de ritmo era la primera vez que ve amos el pabell n porque ni siquiera hab amos entrenado aqu y todo nos vino un poco grande tardamos dos sets en centrarnos y en darnos cuenta de que pod amos jugar al voleibol fue una pena
2716384 ha sido una verdadera pena hemos ganado a estados unidos en otras ocasiones y nos conocemos bien pero hoy no hemos sido nosotros mismos hemos demostrado en el tercer y cuarto set que sabemos y podemos jugar un buen voleibol pero tenemos que centrarnos m s y dejar los nervios en el vestuario
2716385 de todas formas esto no ha hecho sino comenzar y quedan partidos por delante venezuela no ha dicho su ltima palabra y seguimos vivos de cara a nuestro objetivo que es llegar a la segunda ronda
2716386 sabemos que podemos jugar a un alto nivel y lo vamos a demostrar en pek n
2716387 todos nos dan como m ximos favoritos para ganar la medalla de oro en los juegos de pek n pero nosotros venimos de no jugar demasiado bien en la liga mundial y la presi n que tiene el equipo es muy grande espero que no nos pase factura
2716388 egipto es un equipo que siempre lucha mucho aunque es verdad que no es de los m s fuertes la competici n nos ha permitido esta vez tener una salida m s c moda e ir acelerando progresivamente de momento todo va bien pero el camino es largo
2716389 nosotros no podemos pensar igual que la gente tenemos tanta presi n que si hici ramos eso no podr amos controlarla la idea es la misma de siempre pensar en nuestro pr ximo rival sin levantar la mirada m s all no podemos pensar en la final y en la medalla de oro porque todav a no nos hemos clasificado antes habr que disputar la semifinal y antes el choque de cuartos si es que nos clasificamos
2716390 no podemos pensar en cosas que no son reales est claro que nuestra ambici n es llegar lo m s alto posible pero el podio ol mpico es muy caro
2716391 la liga mundial es pasado brasil no pudo ganarla por sexta vez consecutiva y ahora s lo estamos pensando en los juegos ol mpicos que son lo suficientemente importantes c mo para que nos centremos en ellos
2716392 conocemos esta circunstancia y nadie m s interesado que nosotros en hacer algo grande en pek n lo hemos ganado todo en los ltimos a os y creo que nos lo merecemos pero tendremos que recorrer un largo camino y sufrir mucho para conseguirlo queremos el oro y so amos con el oro pero ahora toca trabajar y sufrir ya llegar nuestra recompensa

2716400 you have to follow the money and ask why is sheldon adelson partnering with rudy giuliani
2716401 if rudy giuliani wants to be the crimefighting candidate why is he partnering with a large and growing gambling empire
2716402 wir waren im zweiten satz schon 14 9 vorn hatten den punkt auf 15 9 und dann sind sie nochmal herangekommen da kann es noch schiefgehen aber zum gl ck waren die nerven stark und wir haben es bis zum schluss durchgezogen
2716403 wir haben gewusst dass wir sie schlagen k nnen aber sie sind doch zweimal europameisterinnen geworden sie sind ein erfolgreiches team es war eine nervensache und die taktik war entscheidend wir hatten die bessere
2716404 wir haben nix zu verlieren gegen sie haben wir heuer schon viermal verloren deswegen sind wir sehr motiviert vielleicht schaffen wir es wenn wir so spielen wie jetzt haben wir auf alle f lle eine chance wir werden unser bestes geben
2716405 die chinesen sind in dieser form eine der vier gold favoriten gegen die kann man auch verlieren
2716406 auch die reaktionen uns gegen ber waren durchaus positiv wir waren nicht nerv s es hat uns den einstieg ins turnier erleichtert dass wir gegen china spielen und wenig druck haben
2716407 riesenspa ich war positiv berrascht die fans waren sehr fair und haben uns auch angefeuert
2716408 february 5 has become a de facto national primary day
2716409 this gives massachusetts voters the first chance in years to participate in some significant way in the selection process for nominees in both parties
2716410 gulfport miss saw a 213 percent increase in suicides from 24 to 75 in the first two years after casinos opened in the city such numbers are replicated elsewhere
2716411 should not expect any long term growth effects from legalizing casino gambling
2716412 tactics like this reinforce my belief that i did the right thing
2716413 i think the democratic party which has been in many parts of the country traditionally the party which catholics have supported has been extremely insensitive to the churchs position on the gospel of life in particular and on other moral issues
2716414 raising revenue off the addiction of its citizens is both a bad bet and bad government
2716415 at a time when cities and towns are looking for money this is not the time to bring in gambling
2716416 we need to focus on industries that dont drain the economy
2716417 if i had to tick a box i would say i was pro choice i would vote for a womans right to chose without hesitation because without legal abortions poor women die
2716418 completely opposed to abortion i see it as murder the taking of anothers life
2716419 the really important thing is that we have been able to help this young lady to get on with her life by facilitating her decision not to be a mother at this time
2716420 but the irony of that moment is that you are seeing a snuff movie they have chopped up a human being a baby
2716421 all that i can say is that i wish my days were blessed with more words that could leave me feeling like i feel right now after reading that
2716422 a group of machete wielding militiamen attacked a girls school in the middle of the night the teenagers were rousted from their beds about 2 00 am and forced to line up in the dining hall they were ordered to separate themselves hutu from tutsi so that only the tutsi would die
2716423 we cannot separate ourselves you see because we are not hutu we are not tutsi we are rwandan
2716424 but what a legacy they leave we are not hutu we are not tutsi we are rwandan in that simple sentiment that young girl bespoke a graciousness upon which depends the salvation of the world
2716425 i am saddened that he has greatly disillusioned his political base
2716426 we selected this new softswitch as the platform for launching our new enhanced services because of its scalability flexibility and price to performance advantages
2716427 this new platform addresses the unique requirements of rapidly growing service providers such as i2telecom by empowering us to offer the full range of unified communications services that enterprise and consumer customers increasingly demand in its present configuration the new switch will expand our revenue capacity to over 60 million annually and we can readily scale in size as needed additionally this new platform will enable us to significantly differentiate our company from the legacy communications service providers in our market more details will be announced as they become available
2716428 this is the level of protesting that is going at reproductive health centers in massachusetts
2716429 this is the type of protesting that this law is designed to prevent
2716430 women in the commonwealth have the right to medical care free of violence harassment or intimidation
2716431 the senates decision today to widen the buffer zone around reproductive clinics will protect patients from the abuse that so many have encountered as they seek care
2716432 were not talking here about denying people the right to have freedom of speech
2716433 what were talking about is allowing people to access healthcare
2716434 sustainable development practices to foster economic stability for both urban and rural cities and towns
2716435 a sustainable revenue source to finance state government that support a healthy economy
2716436 would not promote tax equity responsible budgeting sustainable development practices or a sustainable revenue source and likely would damage small businesses and agriculture in western massachusetts
2716437 represents a missed opportunity to advocate for a more equitable tax system
2716438 it was a lively and informative discussion committee members came to the meeting well informed on the subject most members had read the very informative materials prepared by the league of women voters massachusetts concerning the economic and social effects of casino gambling
2716439 it is great to see this level of knowledge and passion concerning such an important issue at the grass roots of the democratic party
2716440 only one committee member expressed support for governor deval patricks casino proposal most committee members were passionately opposed to the governors plan
2716441 amherst voted 84 percent for deval patrick in a three way democratic primary and again by 84 percent in the general election
2716442 adtc members helped lead the effort for deval patrick in western massachusetts
2716443 the governor has done many wonderful things since hes been in office i continue to support him however it is unfortunate to see the governor so out of step with his core supporters on this very important issue
2716444 deep tensions between civil and religious understandings of that institution
2716445 the religious orthodoxy of some sects concerning who may marry
2716446 by sanctioning only marriages between a man and a woman the state relegates the beliefs and practices of these religions denominations and clergy to second class status
2716447 free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference
2716448 we the people in order to form a more perfect union
2716449 people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters
2716450 the past isnt dead and buried in fact it isnt even past
2716451 far greater than what the typical erie county taxpayer has available to them
2716452 she has researched some of the negotiated settlements between the department of justice and other counties
2716453 and what was imposed on other counties was a level of care far far in excess of what you would call a good level practice
2716454 as a litigator she said to me that as soon as you invite someone in to roam the halls and interview anyone on whats a fishing expedition you are subject to all kinds of things coming out that you have no control over
2716455 being unable to afford constitutional rights is not an excuse for not allowing constitutional rights
2716456 many people at the holding center have been convicted of no crime convicted felons have a right to adequate medical treatment and certainly people who have been arrested and cant afford bail should be allowed adequate medical care
2716457 what goes on at the holding center should be a source of shame to anyone in erie county
2716458 several reports of inmate suicide and excessive use of force by facility staff
2716459 the department of justice rejected this out of hand and said we will not permit you to have someone from the county record what it is we are asking
2716460 which is indicative to me they are looking to find things that are not issues and make issues about them by talking with prisoners who quite frankly lack credibility because they are in prison
2716461 the strongest steel comes from the hottest fire and while this is like dancing on the sun were making significant improvements in our business
2716462 they couldnt have picked a worse time to get into the automobile business domestically
2716463 the strongest steel comes from the hottest fire and while this is like dancing on the sun were making significant improvements in our business
2716464 the longterm viability of the companys business model could be undermined
2716465 the impatient money has become even more impatient and cerberus is an impatient money company how long can they tolerate negative cash flow
2716466 i wish i could be more optimistic but i dont see any daylight here
2716467 i doubt seriously as an outsider that they were planning a quick spin here
2716468 well be back with more bikini volleyball after this message

2716471 i was back at 1030 if somebody says you cant go to the opening ceremony because you will get tired it doesnt make sense
2716472 i slept for six hours before my race that is fair enough
2716473 this is my first olympics performance wise i am not expecting much because i am inexperienced and have to learn so many things from the top guys
2716474 so i thought maybe i should enjoy this olympics and maybe i can miss the opening ceremony of the london olympics in 2012

2716478 cadre comments the new atheists based on antipathy to those different
2716479 a line of young poplars linked the episcopal courtyard with the school on the south against the earth wall was the one row of trees they had found growing there when they first came old old tamarisks with twisted trunks they had been so neglected left to fight for life in such hard sun baked burro trodden ground that their trunks had the hardness of cypress they looked indeed like very old posts well seasoned and polished by time miraculously endowed with the power to burst into delicate foliage and flowers to cover themselves with long brooms of lavender pink blossom
2716480 based on a preliminary investigation there are a number of unresolved issues because of the unresolved issues the officer is remaining on duty
2716481 my understanding is that several facts of the allegations have absolutely positively been proven false
2716482 based on everything i know credibility is clearly a problem
2716483 this is the guy to have do your templates hes professional quick and creative he worked with me until the template looked exactly how i wanted to look bottom line is he does great work i will be using him in the future

2716485 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions
2716486 for example anything over three years old should automatically be deleted i would carefully consider it as an option
2716487 i think from bretts point of view the chance for him to get here was to be someone that he never was and that was to put up a huge fuss and a huge stink and thats just not brett favre
2716488 i think he always wanted the best for his teammates and the locker room over there and therefore he was willing to let ted and the guys over there do what they could do

2716494 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2716495 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2716496 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on nonuse of force with south ossetians
2716497 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2716498 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2716499 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2716500 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2716501 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2716502 first of all we need to remove 1 000 guys from here within 96 hours after that the rest of the guys
2716503 the unplanned redeployment of georgian forces will have some impact in the near term however as with any change in force structure we will make adjustments to ensure sustainment of coalition operations
2716504 we do not anticipate their departure will result in a significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
2716505 they want to go home as soon as possible and help
2716506 we have the same situation in our home as here though the territory is different we have no desert
2716507 het seniorenlokaal de preker werd dagelijks bezocht door een veertigtal vaste klanten die dreigen nu te vereenzamen op hun appartementje zeker in dit seizoen omdat het te koud is om in de tuin te zitten hier wonen erg veel mensen met een laag inkomen en die kunnen het zich niet veroorloven dagelijks een caf of een taverne te bezoeken er moet voor deze mensen echt dringend een oplossing komen
2716508 you do the best you can and its not always pretty

2716510 i think china probably thought this was good because we showed some weakness
2716511 but this brought us together even more and made us even stronger just wait and see what we can do now

2716513 there has been a lot of comment today regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2716514 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2716515 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2716516 but if you dont watch the show you wouldnt know shes also a loving mother of three

2716520 go outside and stand on the mountain before the lord the lord will be passing by
2716521 when i began investigating and documenting the history of prabhupadas books in 2003 it seemed more important than ever
2716522 the bbt was increasingly under fire from within iskcon for their editorial changes defending themselves from criticisms which had little or nothing to do with reality
2716523 it will also include resources such as handwritten corrections and references that prabhupada used such as sridhara swamis srimad bhagavatam commentaries and dr radhakrishnans gita
2716524 devotees working on srila prabhupadas books will be able to compare everything and understand how the editions we have now developed over the years
2716525 these are accompanied by infor mation on how to understand editorial changes who made them when they were made and how accurate or inaccurate they were
2716526 there were gorgeous orchards and gardens all around and the whole city was encircled by cannons so that no enemy could enter very easily
2716527 despite the recent attacks on the editors for making changes
2716528 its a fact that the bbts highest priority is always to bring the books closer to what prabhupada originally meant
2716529 and often without background history and information to help you understand what prabhupada wanted to say its hard to reflect the mood intended in a different language a translator shouldnt have to guess if he doesnt understand it that means the reader has no chance
2716530 prabhupadas works have such value for iskcon and the bbt and are already the topic of major heated discussions
2716531 those who remember how they were put together wont be here for much longer some like hayagriva have already left us and thats why this project must be done immediately
2716532 for a person devoid of devotional service birth in a great family or nation knowledge of revealed scripture performance of austerities and penances and chanting of vedic mantras are all like ornaments on a dead body such ornaments simply serve the concocted pleasures of the general populace
2716533 well why dont you take her and break train her and then bring her back about a week later that would be such a huge help for me since you are so much better at that than me
2716534 you can take her and break her and give her back then
2716535 we have not heard of this from the religion of these later days meaning christianity if this quran were true the christians would have told us about it
2716536 allah says that the actual reason with those people for their denial is not any defect in the message of islam but their own arrogance jealousy and insistence on following the blind
2716537 in discussing this passage the scholars of tafsir quran commentary mention a story which is mostly based upon israiliyat israelite narrations nothing has been reported about this from the infallible prophet that we could accept as true
2716538 and david thought in other words he became certain that we had indeed tried him that we had caused him to fall into a trial that is a test through his love for that woman so he sought forgiveness of his lord and fell down bowing in other words prostrate and repented
2716539 did you not hear that sulayman peace be upon him had a horse that had wings
2716540 the messenger of allah smiled so broadly that i could see his molars
2716541 because he had married a woman solely out of his desire for her
2716542 a boiling fluid and a fluid dark murky intensely cold
2716543 i am better than he thou createdst me from fire and him thou createdst from clay

2716548 a person working in the bank reported it we have several teams looking for her we have to be certain
2716549 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2716550 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2716551 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2716552 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2716553 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2716554 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2716555 we havent fully recovered from a natural disaster and now were again being battered by a man made calamity
2716556 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2716557 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2716558 a call to action saving lives through nuclear weapons control and disarmament
2716559 it felt like someone had opened the door of a furnace behind you
2716560 weve got to get rid of these nuclear weapons before something terrible happens
2716561 both sides of the camp are talking about the need to reduce nuclear weapons
2716562 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2716563 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2716564 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2716565 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2716566 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2716567 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2716568 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2716569 my views developed in the course of time but i have always believed in what i did and never acted against it
2716570 the soviet government had let the genie out of the bottle and however hard they tried later they couldnt put it back in
2716571 russia can neither be grasped by the mind nor measured by any common yardstick no attitude to her other than one of blind faith is admissible
2716572 broke russias back the red terror unleashed by its leaders their willingness to drown russia in blood is the first and foremost proof of it
2716573 the bitter russian experience which i have been studying and describing all my life will be for us a lesson that keeps us from new disastrous breakdowns

2716676 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment
2716677 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation and it is a situation which is dangerous not because the security researcher exposes the vulnerability but because the person who made the product made the vulnerability then this should be core speech
2716678 knowingly causes the transmission of a program information code or command to a computer or computer system
2716679 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code or similar types of information to a computer
2716680 it does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans nevertheless the court believed that the act of giving a presentation to a group of humans was covered by the computer fraud computer intrusion statute we believe this is wrong
2716681 basically what the court is suggesting here is that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law
2716682 as far as i know this is completely unprecedented and it has a tremendous chilling effect on sharing this sort of research and we intend to fight it with everything weve got
2716683 we didnt find that to be a very pleasing way to start a nice dialogue with them

2716685 please understand that rhetoric aside the intention was to provide an interesting and useful talk but not one that would enable people to defraud the massachusetts bay transit system
2716686 there can be no dialogue with the georgian leadership they are criminals
2716687 in the past trying to use notebook parts in desktops jacked up the price of these systems to make them unattractive financially
2716688 now you can move to a smaller form factor and on top of that you can play the green card because these things use a lot less power and energy
2716689 i think that apple will probably continue to grow share for a while
2716690 you will see much nicer looking pcs and more targeted efforts at creating a better experience for people
2716691 at the same time the onus is on us to go one step above and tell end users that the windows operating system is not as heavy as you might think
2716692 saying we agree with you a mobile platform has a lot of value but if you consider a new form factor you will still see that you need not only a mobile platform but a non mobile one
2716693 give us another year and a half or two years and you might see even better stuff coming down the pike
2716694 ive been in the industry for 11 years and never have i seen such a fast pace of change that ive seen in the last year and a half

2716712 i look at the awful photos and think how much better they could be
2716713 you dont always need an expensive new camera to take better photos learning properly how to use the one youve got is often all it takes
2716714 in the current climate its the more farsighted agencies that are realising the importance of training in all aspects of their business survival and photography is one area many just never bothered about in the good times
2716715 as a professional property photographer fewer agents can justify my fees for ordinary domestic properties but they can benefit from my expertise whats more when the upturn comes who are they going to think of to photograph their top end properties
2716716 oh and i always point out that my training will usually improve their holiday snaps as well

2716733 the top of the ancient walls which were touched by the collapse of the roof were damaged
2716734 also i was assured that this new structure would last three hundred years resist 10 richter scale earthquakes and 60 inches 130cm of snow but it couldnt even support its own weight
2716735 i am annoyed for the last three years i havent been able to work on the site i have not even been given full access to the site the contractors have told me that i can enter at my own risk but they cant guarantee the structures stability obviously it would be irresponsible for me to take other archaeologists in there
2716736 it is one of the most important sites in the world closed because of poor planning i feel bad because its as though we cannot handle a site of such importance its bad for business yes but it is also bad for the island in many other ways
2716737 but now the ministry is powerless in the face of bureaucracy not only internal but also external the eu central archaeological council and government have the power to veto and interfere no one is happy that it is closed but what are we to do
2716738 it will take generations and generations for us just to investigate the roofed area alone
2716739 but the sites we have excavated have been luxurious which makes it likely that there remain other areas outside the roofed one that were not luxurious in truth we do not know

2716745 in spite of mackinnons fervent declarations no reputable study has concluded that pornography is a significant cause of sexual crime many of them conclude on the contrary that the causes of violent personality lie mainly in childhood before exposure to pornography can have had any effect and that desire for pornography is a symptom rather than a cause of deviance

2716837 in 2004 adults who reported low back pain lasting more than 24 hours during the past three months reported worse health status using a number of different measures than people who did not report recent low back pain regardless of age
2716838 overall 28 of adults with low back pain said they had a limitation of activity caused by a chronic condition compared with 10 of adults who did not report low back pain adults with recent low back pain were about three times as likely to report fair or poor health status and more than four times as likely to experience serious psychological distress as people without low back pain

2716842 the aim of the experiment is to investigate differences in peoples ability to use their spatial memory in physical and virtual systems and to see what effects occur as richer levels of a third dimension are available
2716843 results show that the subjects performance deteriorated in both the physical and virtual systems as their freedom to locate items in the third dimension increased subjective measures reinforce the performance measures indicating that users found interfaces with higher dimensions more cluttered and less efficient

2716854 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2716855 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2716856 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2716857 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2716858 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2716859 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2716860 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2716861 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2716917 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2716918 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

2716922 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2716946 thanks to stable mortgage rates and an increase in consumer confidence the resale markets performance in july is outstanding
2716947 a small decrease is excellent news especially considering that there was an all time record set in july 2007 when sales increased by 25 as well montreal continues to shine compared to other major cities such as calgary and vancouver whose july sales decreased by 12 and 44 respectively
2716948 montreal continues to be a good real estate investment as evidenced by the gradual progressive increase in its resale prices

2716959 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2716960 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2716961 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2716962 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2716963 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2716964 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2716965 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2716966 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2716967 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2716968 in order to consider withdrawal of our forces we must make sure that there is no chance of genocide there
2716969 there is a straightforward way to stop fighting to stop killing for georgians to withdraw and then to have an agreement on non use of force signed and then we can talk on other verity things including on military and political arrangements
2716970 certain georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia
2716971 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2716972 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2716973 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2716974 maybe it will be quiet in the future im an optimist
2716975 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2716976 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2716977 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2716978 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2716979 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2716980 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2716981 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2716982 georgias actions are criminal whereas russias actions are absolutely legitimate
2716983 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are obviously a crime it is a crime against its own people first and foremost
2716984 a deadly blow has been struck on the territorial integrity of georgia itself which implies huge damage to its state structure
2716985 the aggression has resulted in numerous victims including those among civilians and has virtually led to a humanitarian catastrophe
2716986 time will pass and the people of georgia will give their objective estimations to the actions of the incumbent administration
2716987 it is based on an attempt of the georgian administration to get other countries involved in its bloody affairs
2716988 in accordance with international agreements including the agreement of 1999 russia does not only execute peacemaking functions but is obliged in case one party breaks the cease fire agreement to defend the other party which is exactly what we are doing in case with south ossetia
2716989 we perfectly realize what world we live in today we will strive for fair and peaceful solutions of all conflicting situations which we inherited from the past

2716996 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2716997 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us
2716998 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2716999 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2717000 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2717001 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2717002 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2717003 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2717004 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2717005 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2717006 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe

2717072 if youre a browns fan you knew this would happen you knew youd get your hopes up you knew youd be teased you knew the 10 6 browns season was too good that something would go wrong
2717073 because if youre a browns fan you were born to be broken hearted
2717074 youre only allowed to be a browns fan if something goes wrong then wear it like a badge that you were there when it all went wrong
2717075 you should know better you should know the browns never get a break unless it results in a fracture followed by a staph infection
2717076 did anyone of us actually think the colts would win this game and send the browns to the playoffs
2717077 tennessee took the opening kickoff marched 79 yards on 11 plays for a touchdown
2717078 then kerry collins took over for tennessee and youd have sworn he once played without a face mask back before otto graham took snaps for the browns but youre a browns fan and you knew what was coming
2717079 a good season ends like that watching tv cheering for a bunch of guys in indianapolis uniforms whose names you didnt know your team is only the third one since 1992 with a 10 6 record to miss the playoffs ten wins usually is an invitation but not for the browns and down deep you knew it would happen
2717080 as colts backup quarterback jim sorgi struggled did you ask
2717081 jim sorgi has the best job in america he gets to backup a dominant starter who never misses a game so he never has to play plus he gets paid a couple hundred thousand a year that would be awesome
2717082 hey if romeo isnt going to play quinn today why dont you trade him to indy for jim sorgi after the game tonight see if the colts will give us brady back
2717083 theres been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry

2717086 we havent had any recent contact with real madrid has there been any attempt to heal the rift yeah that will be right
2717087 they put a bid in i dont know if it was fax or letter or whatever just one it was sometime in the summer
2717088 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days
2717089 it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance

2717110 georgian forces have temporarily left tskhinvali as part of a tactical manoeuvre they are in positions on the outskirts of tskhinvali
2717111 there have been eyewitness reports that georgian troop columns have been moving out of tskhinvali and moving back into georgian territory
2717112 five people have been injured in what appears to be a russian air raid
2717113 when you speak to people here they have no idea why this place would be targeted while there are military parts housed here it is not a military base some say that perhaps there may have been confusion on the russian side
2717114 our navy sailors have been assigned the task of preventing arms and other military supplies from reaching georgia by sea
2717115 these reports do not correspond with reality a coastal blockade would mean war with georgia we are not in a state of war with georgia
2717116 ukraine reserves the right to bar warships and vessels which could take part in the action conflict with georgia from returning to ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved

2717121 russian planes have not stopped bombing the kodori gorge since yesterday and now they are also bombing zugdidi
2717122 georgian forces have temporarily left tskhinvali as part of a tactical manoeuvre they are in positions on the outskirts of tskhinvali
2717123 the current situation on the ground is very fluid and very volatile
2717124 theres so much uncertainty and the worsening situation on the ground could threaten the entire peace process
2717125 we will not agree to any re negotiation we dont know how the government would re start the talks if the deal is declared unconstitutional
2717126 we have given up our secessionist position and were very committed to the peace process
2717127 i hope the central government could show the same sincerity and commitment were getting frustrated and we cant forever be taken for a ride
2717128 in the past exceptions we have made called before the council you are again resolved this issue must be
2717129 seriously it was her idea to have sex in the training room she wanted it i wanted it were almost consenting adults wheres the problem
2717130 almost old enough and yet not actually old enough under the law mind you
2717131 uh huh so were close enough to being adults that you can send us out to die on missions for the good of the republic but not old enough to sleep together without getting in trouble
2717132 and i thought bush came up with some ridiculous stuff
2717133 your age and the laws of the republic are only a secondary problem in this matter attachment is forbidden your relationship violates the jedi code and we have already spoken to you once about the matter yet you and padawan dorset continue to grow closer if you dont deal with the situation soon we will be forced to take care of it for you
2717134 youre threatening to kick me out moi you know youre stuck with me even if the patients in the nearest local mental hospital have better emotional control i was incarnated directly as one of your padawans
2717135 forget your emo little chosen one ladies and gentleman and assorted weird alien beings im a gift from the force
2717136 aware of your origin we are saddled with your presence the jedi order is yet with padawan dorset inappropriate your behavior is stop it you must required in the order her presence is not
2717137 so what youre threatening to kick hiskari out if we continue to see each other
2717138 wait i know of at least two dozen padawans ive caught getting horizontal with each other why arent they being called in to get bitched at
2717139 to be a jedi does not mean you have to be celibate it is merely attachment thats forbidden
2717140 so i can have sex with other padawans i just cant date them thats the message here
2717141 that is fucking awesome no pun intended oh my god im going to have to make a to do list
2717142 do you know how many amazingly hot padawans are running around the temple guys and girls with the exercise program youve got us all on you could probably run the galaxys best modeling agency out of this temple if id known dating was taboo but sleeping around was okay there are so many beds id be trying out

2717144 we have made exceptions in the past for your lightsaber crystal and your attire

2717146 cool well i should probably get back you guys pulled me out of a lightsaber training session an actual one not a lightsaber training session with hiskari this was fun we should to it again sometime
2717147 hiskari dorset is my padawan at least with the present situation padawan chases oddness is contained to just one other
2717148 ive seen her looking at your padawan tod master koth and master tis mini me chadaara ko as well if we had to choose would you rather see chase with padawan dorset or hopping from padawan to padawan and infecting others with her bizarre ideals and vocabulary

2717178 so i thought maybe i should enjoy this olympics and maybe i can miss the opening ceremony of the london olympics in 2012
2717179 high death toll which includes civilians and peace keepers and the rising number of refugees
2717180 when holding the presidency of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe osce in 2006 belgium closely followed the situation in south ossetia belgium also took up its responsibility when holding the presidency of the un security council before august 2008
2717181 it is of the utmost importance that the different parties involved in this conflict refrain from new violent acts
2717182 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2717183 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2717184 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2717185 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2717186 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private

2717188 talent is highly valued but students and job applicants are still not treated like consumers of a service employers on the other hand dont have any option of identifying people who really want to work with them and nurturing them
2717189 the difference is that those link individuals we want to connect employers and potential employees
2717190 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
2717191 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes

2717193 ich finde es erstaunlich dass unter allen gro en industriestaaten der welt von den usa bis china japan und russland die deutschen die einzigen sind die glauben sie k nnten ohne kernkraft auskommen wir haben praktisch unseren kohlebergbau aufgegeben wir haben so gut wie kein l in unserem boden auch nicht vor unseren k sten deshalb liegt es nahe dass deutschland einen teil seiner energie aus kernkraft bezieht nat rlich hat kernkraft ihre risiken es gibt aber keine energie und nichts auf der welt ohne risiken nicht einmal die liebe
2717194 die gro e mehrheit aller staaten der welt aller parlamente und regierungen der welt ist zu dem ergebnis gekommen dass dieses risiko ethisch vertretbar sei ich wundere mich dar ber dass allein deutschland zu einem anderen ergebnis kommen m chte

2717199 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
2717200 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
2717201 iraqs debt to kuwait is an old debt it has to be paid or iraq has to pay its interest these are the rights of the kuwaiti people
2717202 the economic situation in iraq is witnessing a big improvement this year and iraq will have a large surplus in the budget
2717203 thanks to a concerned citizen who provided the information on a potential vbied it was able to be secured without loss or injury to any civilians
2717204 our forces captured jassem al khafadji who says he has kidnapped and assassinated 11 men and five women
2717205 he then led us to the place where he had buried them
2717206 we must truly stand on our own two feet we made a promise to the iraqi people that we are going to undertake all the tasks of our role by the middle or end of 2009
2717207 its time to end the war in iraq responsibly by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2717208 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2717209 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2717210 we could have rebuilt american schools and roads and bridges we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs
2717211 turkey has manoeuvred to create an anti kurdish iraqi parliament
2717212 it is behind the adoption of article 24 of the electoral law as it is trying by all means to reduce the gains made by the kurds after the fall of saddam hussein

2717226 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2717227 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2717228 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2717229 one mistake many anglers make is the same one they make with hexagenia mayflies using imitations that are far too big if you hold a grasshopper up to a hook gauge you see that even the biggest are usually no 2 4 in length and most are about 4 8 you dont have to exaggerate the size to get fish interested in hoppers the insect equivalent of a submarine sandwich

2717236 i was told the whale sharks skin was rough so i took a scraper along with me and scratched its back it slowed down the next day it returned and i did the same thing it obviously enjoyed it by day three it was there waiting to have its back scratched
2717237 but the demon shark still remained a mystery to me
2717238 we also had about 500 giraffe zebra impala warthog but particularly special were the leopards
2717239 i attended the oldest school in the country kings canterbury because of the right contacts i was accepted into the inner circle the colonial yobbo amid the toffs
2717240 the raf and british troops the kenya police and the general service units were the main forces against the mau mau however the pseudo gangs were very effective of european origin but kenya bred
2717241 we would give them a nice soft leaf to use after they had been to the toilet but under it would be a stinging nettle
2717242 i even played rugby against idi amin he was a popular second row forward in the kings african rifles
2717243 i found that they knew everything there was to know about the biology of sharks but were sadly lacking about shark behaviour and i wanted to know more about these animals that people had such a phobia about
2717244 kathy kay a campaigner of note attached to the wildlife and environment society of sa said they often used me because i was their stroppiest ngo speaker
2717245 if you believe in forever then life is just a one night stand
2717246 ive become convinced that the presidents party mounted a massive coordinated campaign to subvert the will of the people in 2004
2717247 it certainly does seem to have become a cottage industry
2717248 whether it was grand conspiracy how you view that probably depends on how you view the world generally
2717249 when you start out with that as the foundation and then you have the inevitable problems that you have with a record turnout then when mistakes occur people get frustrated and they tend to think that the motivations for why these things occurred were not innocent
2717250 in my estimation and in that of most independent observers ohioans were well served by their state and local elections officials in 2004
2717251 if everything goes well we can stand back and say they survived the change
2717252 if not a high degree of change and a close result once again could be problematic
2717253 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2717254 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2717255 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2717256 if you visualise being stronger running faster or winning you are priming your nervous system to do just that
2717257 studies have found that the method can enhance physical performance significantly sometimes by 20 percent or more
2717258 breathing deeply imagine your headache wash away as a stream of cool blue light or fluid runs through your head dispersing the pain and calming the whole area down
2717259 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2717260 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2717261 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
2717262 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines

2717266 ich erhoffe mir dass mein trainerstab und ich dass wir unsere handschrift kenntlich machen k nnen

2717270 vom fc bayern werden erfolge erwartet bei allen neuerungen die jetzt eingef hrt werden
2717271 wir m ssen nicht jedes jahr deutscher meister werden aber wir wollen jedes jahr in die champions league
2717272 um hohe ziele zu erreichen braucht es schon die rib rys und tonis und die kosten geld
2717273 zu erwarten der fc bayern k nne in der k nigsklasse eine besondere rolle spielen wird immer unrealistischer

2717275 i received a telephone call last night telling me i was the next to die
2717276 we will not give up we will not let the insecurity prevent us from helping somali people who are in urgent need of aid
2717277 it seems there is an anti aid worker campaign going on in the afgoye area it looks like the attackers want the aid workers expelled from the region for insecurity to reign
2717278 kariye was one of those who organised the protests over the increase in attacks on aid workers he may have become a target as a result
2717279 all parties to this conflict have an obligation under international law to protect civilians and to refrain from indiscriminate attacks
2717280 yet it seems at every turn the death toll of ordinary somalis is growing far too many of them are women children or aid workers who have no part in this conflict
2717281 the death of tens of civilians in bomb and mortar attacks in mogadishu in the past week the current massive displacement of civilians due to fighting in beletweyne and the latest killing of an aid worker underline the toll conflict is taking on civilian populations and the relief operation
2717282 all this is occurring in the context of a severely deteriorating humanitarian situation in which aid workers themselves subject to attacks in increasing numbers are more and more challenged to reach people with the assistance they require
2717283 the humanitarian situation has deteriorated steadily in the 18 months that i have been emergency relief coordinator
2717284 and has now reached unprecedented desperate levels even in the context of somalia over the last 18 years
2717285 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2717286 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is very necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start
2717287 the numbers are there that is written on the wall it is better that he should say goodbye and leave
2717288 were talking about total russian aggression by land air and sea
2717289 it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately
2717290 also in the name of a shared christian heritage refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict
2717291 together with our orthodox brethren we pray intensely for these intentions which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary mother of god and all christians
2717292 iraqis are combating terrorism with one hand and building a democratic state with the other and this is not an easy job
2717293 we have carried messages to all the countries we visited that iraq is in need of reconstruction in all fields including railways oil electricity bridges and housing

2717303 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2717304 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2717305 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2717306 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2717307 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2717308 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia

2717321 at this point i think it is reasonable to say that tomorrow probably will come and go without that happening
2717322 we need to have a strong verification regime before we can take action on removing the north koreans from the state sponsors of terrorism list

2717354 occasionally the olympic family has come in handy but even getting investors through it has been mainly happenstance
2717355 people tell you youre not going to make the olympic team
2717356 i think about those things every day when it comes to business
2717357 olympians have a sense of dedication and focus that is not typical youre talking several standard deviations away from the average once you shift that focus to something else that can be pretty forceful
2717358 some people get excited when they see im a former olympian
2717359 but anybody that looks at it as just a one week phenomenon has missed the real point
2717360 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2717361 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2717362 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2717363 there are a number of initiatives around the world to try to define what carbon neutral means and set some rules about what counts and what doesnt count
2717364 this is where you can play with the idea of carbon neutrality where you can draw those boundaries to be forgiving to your own claim
2717365 to make a claim that its the best or the greenest or the greatest is laced with all sorts of questions that are completely arguable
2717366 natural and pandemic disasters and a growing competititionf or resources
2717367 you build yourself up to go and give a big output of energy and when you dont have that output of energy at the end of the day theres still some energy moving throughout your system

2717369 it feels like our crew has this bubble around us of just pure confidence in each other and what weve come out here to accomplish

2717392 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
2717393 our plan went back more than 12 months in terms of what we were going to do today
2717394 sharon laws and emma pooley and i were all part of a team and we all knew we were good riders but the best chance we had was to ride together and try to win as a team
2717395 riding as a team was the best way to be successful
2717396 it wasnt just her the whole team got it spot on
2717397 i was just so happy and there were so many emotions that were coming out all at once that i probably wasnt composed enough to take my hands off the bars and do a salute that way
2717398 goldie knew what he wanted and the look has turned out to be just that
2717399 im wearing a pagdi but we didnt want it to have a complete indian look so we used leather texture the outfit is made of chiffon and we have used a waist coat too
2717400 i had to do action scenes and the hair kept coming in my way
2717401 but then that was the idea to make me look tough yet feminine
2717402 i wasnt on fire i was just three for three on three pointers
2717403 it was actually a simple shot its very special to beat argentina in our first game

2717415 n o consegui fazer a minha pega e o facto de ter perdido a passagem para meias finais pode ter pesado um bocadinho estarmos t o perto e depois acabarmos t o longe
2717416 ich denke wir sind einfach auf nummer sicher gegangen und sind konservativ gefahren selbst im verkehr haben wir nichts berst rzt das auto war fantastisch wir waren nicht so schnell wie wir zu sein dachten besonders im training und im qualifying der wagen war extrem schnell wir hatten eine gruppe von jungs hinter uns die m chtig druck gemacht haben vitor meira und marco andretti waren am ende sehr schnell
2717417 am ende war alles strategie es war verr ckt es gab keine m glichkeit ihn castroneves anm d red noch zu schnappen zwischen ihm und uns lag die halbe strecke ich wusste dass unser auto wohl etwas schneller als seines ist aber nicht mehr als um 30 km h es war nett den sieg so zu holen wie wir es geschafft haben

2717423 we did not expect such a big remain excavations are still being held under these walls we are planning to have more information about the age of the ruins
2717424 we have found a variety of houses that we did not expect we realized there were no theaters before roman and hellenistic period but we have found the hillside houses made of soils stone floors pillars potteries have been found and handed to the manisa museum it was very enriching to find the lydian houses as they proved the lydians to be a very rich society
2717425 as far as we understood even with the smallest golden coin three sheep could have been bought during the excavations a sikke was found near a skeleton of a soldier in those times people were keeping their sikkes in their mouths as there were no pockets whatsoever
2717426 these roads are as old as the silk road there is a roman street right under the road covering a lydian road our studies will carry on all these routes
2717427 it is as if we have just started the excavations there are still many places to investigate as many things are still ambiguous so we have a lot to do
2717428 what is known by prevailing custom has the strength of what is specifically stated as a contractual condition
2717429 a case study in the interaction between fiqh and civil codes by qadi faisal al mawlawi h
2717430 i was just focussed on my relief that this was happening at all with all the delays of the past four years
2717431 honestly there were times when i thought it would never happen
2717432 those scholars who study the history of science tend to focus on science beginning with copernicus and galileo and harvey and often go so far as to assert that no such thing existed before
2717433 the texts that survive tend to be the more popular texts i e those that were more often copied and textbooks not the research works or the advanced technical ones
2717434 both the greeks and the romans valued individual bravery in war
2717435 nothing like this instrument is preserved elsewhere nothing comparable to it is known from any ancient scientific text or literary allusion on the contrary from all that we know of science and technology in the hellenistic age we should have felt that such a device could not exist
2717436 requires us to completely rethink our attitudes toward ancient greek technology
2717437 it must surely rank as one of the greatest mechanical inventions of all time
2717438 a bit frightening to know that just before the fall of their great civilization the ancient greeks had come so close to our age not only in their thought but also in their scientific technology
2717439 classical scholarship is very literary and focusses on texts such as the writing of homer sophocles virgil or horace or it is old fashioned and historical and focusses on leaders and battles through the texts of herodotus and thucydides or it is anthropological archeological and focusses on population distributions and suchlike so when an archeological discovery about ancient technology arrives it does not fit because its new its scientific and its not a text plus there is only one such device and unique items tend to worry scholars and scientists who quite reasonably prefer patterns and larger collections of data
2717440 it is neither facile nor uninstructive to remark that the antikythera mechanism dropped and sank twice
2717441 slightly boring because we have seen so much of that stuff before except for one thing among all those art objects there was one thing so entirely different and strange that it is nearly impossible it was recovered from the sea in 1900 and is some kind of machine with gear trains very much like the inside of a modern wind up alarm clock
2717442 of all the things in the museum why does he pick out that particular item what is so special about it
2717443 it was a way of keeping track not of time as we think of it
2717444 but of the movement of the stars a deeper time
2717445 the greeks saw the babylonian formulas in terms of geometry they saw all these circles all spinning around each other in the sky and of course this fits in perfectly with the concept of gearworks the gears are making little orbits
2717446 which at each revolution reproduces the same motions of the sun the moon and the five planets that take place in the heavens every day and night
2717447 but in light of what we know about the mechanism
2717448 i am beginning to wonder whether this was a much more complicated clock than we think
2717449 i could see right away that prices reconstruction doesnt explain what we can see
2717450 the man who made the mechanism made no mistakes he went straight to what he wanted in the simplest way possible
2717451 i really hate confrontation and antagonism of any kind even competition
2717452 that he had it fixed in his mind that it would be his name preferably alone that would be attached to the solution
2717453 there is a long established unwritten law concerning the study of greek antiquities which is that when one researcher has access to the material any other researcher is denied access until the first has finished
2717454 in my case this understanding was swept aside through the machinations of the group
2717455 this completely vindicated prices idea of the metonic cycle of two hundred and thirty five lunar months on the upper back dial
2717456 we had discovered the users manual right inside the machine
2717457 one of the difficulties in reading the texts was that in ancient greek there were no spaces between the words and there are many alternative readings also in many cases the edges of the lines are missing so we dont know what is continuous text
2717458 i felt as though i were communicating with an ancient colleague through the mechanism
2717459 to stop me from lifting my knee in some chaps groin
2717460 i think they must relate to whatever that bit of metal was used for before
2717461 k nns det inte bra att veta att man r s omtyckt
2717462 the life of the human being is not maintained nor is sustained except in the context of two institutions
2717463 a cross disciplinary versus a specialist approach to knowledge and learning
2717464 the multidisciplinary approach to knowledge which is what the student needs early on to grasp islamic tradition must not be depreciated in value by the new current to focus on specialization
2717465 an islamist is someone who places her or his muslim identity at the centre of her or his political practice that is islamists are people who use the language of islamic metaphors to think through their political destinies those who see in islam their political future
2717466 it could be argued that imposing the end of the veil is not the same in principle as enforcing the wearing of the veil
2717467 when white women of the nineteenth century saw veiled women they understood it to be a sign of cultural backwardness and female subordination they did not make the same assumptions about their own clothes victorian corsets which for them did not signify female subordination because they did not signify cultural backwardness cultural backwardness that is a culture not modelled upon a european template manifested itself in female subordination by focusing attention on the veil the critics of the veil have often neglected far more serious issues
2717468 if the category of fundamentalism becomes simply a description of strongly held beliefs then it is clear that even the most radical democrats or postmodern bourgeois liberals have a fundamentalist core
2717469 to modernize the kemalists had to westernize but the very nature of westernization implied the necessity of orientalization since you can only westernize what is not western that is what is oriental thus to westernize you had first to orientalize one had to represent the oriental before one could postulate westernization as an antidote to reject the orient in the name of the west meant the articulation of the orient as the orient
2717470 if kemal ataturk can be presented as an icon marking the culmination of various projects of westernization then the figure of khomeini marks the end of kemalism
2717471 the battle between eurocentrism and the logic of islamism is really a conflict about genealogies a struggle about how to narrate the future world the western discourse is a product of a number of projects which narrate the world in terms of the continuity of the west the limit of europe comes when groups of people begin to articulate their position on the basis of the rejection of europes claims to copyright
2717472 no doubt islamist tide will ebb and flow over the coming years no doubt islamists will suffer disappointments and will advance and retreat but as long as there are muslims the promise and fear of islamism will remain for in the end for us muslims islam is another name for the hope of something better
2717473 an islamist is someone who places her or his muslim identity at the centre of her or his political practice that is islamists are people who use the language of islamic metaphors to think through their political destinies those who see in islam their political future

2717477 if it sounds too good to be true it generally is
2717478 aspps best practices for locating copyright owners of photographic and visual art
2717479 especially in light of the orphan works pending legislation it was our hope that these guidelines would be helpful in locating copyright holders and that they might eventually aid in the construction of the defined
2717480 the orphan works bill has the potential to erode the protection that copyright owners have fought for over many years
2717481 it puts the burden on the copyright owner to find the offending parties and either negotiate with them without the remedies currently available to bring about reasonable compensation or bring costly litigation in short for copyright owners the orphan works bill is a disaster
2717482 the original premise of this legislation was to protect libraries museums and other not for profit users in efforts to digitize archives of materials for which owners could not be located however as drafted the legislation goes much further it applies to any use of a copyrighted work in short it creates an incentive to steal first and pay later if caught policing infringing uses on the internet is already difficult this raises the bar and places the burden on copyright owners to locate infringers of their works at the same time threatening to wipe out 100 years of legal protection under u s law
2717483 the internet computer and consumer electronics industries utilize vast amounts of copyrighted works to attract customers to their websites from which they derive enormous profits from advertising and subscription fees these industries have long sought to eliminate copyright protection and to avoid paying for the content they use to lure consumers at the same time companies such as google and other computer related interests have provided more than million dollars to the library of congress of which the u s copyright office which initiated the orphan works legislation is a part
2717484 mondello is a whiz kid who used his smarts and savvy to rip off software makers and consumers
2717485 we are fortunate that he has been stopped but there are hundreds more like him running illegal operations on ebay and other sites the mondello case demonstrates that these pirates wont simply get a slap on the wrist when caught they very well may end up doing serious time in federal prison
2717486 were seeing that the problem is bigger than has been previously reported
2717487 were also seeing an increase across the board on the most common incidences of lying on resumes
2717488 one and a half million college students have been recently unleashed into the job market many of them are still looking for jobs
2717489 we want to get the word out to employers and job seekers
2717490 employers need to be especially vigilant during these periods job seekers must know that more employers than ever use rigorous background screening procedures to vet the information contained on their resume
2717491 we already have legislation the copyright new technologies amendment act 2008 that covers off the illegal distribution of digital sound and video recordings via the internet
2717492 further the act has only recently been passed with many of its newly amended and introduced provisions yet to take root and be fully tested
2717493 we strongly urge the government to adopt a wait and see approach with respect to the effectiveness of new zealands amended copyright act before committing to sweeping multilateral digital copyright enforcement measures as part of acta
2717494 even in a healthy ecosystem illegal software causes hidden costs and friction in the sales and deployment processes
2717495 at its worst rampant piracy in some economies is tearing down the opportunity for legitimate businesses to exist and thrive
2717496 the flip side of this is that within those hidden costs may lie hidden opportunities in helping these customers turn their licensing situation around
2717497 much of the misuse especially in developed countries is inadvertent a savvy vendor can realize an opportunity by helping customers to true up their licensing realizing that every dollar saved from software pirates can translate to over five times that amount for the channel

2717499 this code of best practices will protect an emerging creative zone online video from de facto censorship
2717500 creators online video providers and copyright holders will be able to know when copying is stealing and when its legal
2717501 the fair use doctrine is every bit as relevant in the digital domain as it has been for almost two centuries in the print environment
2717502 here we see again the strong connection between the fair use principle in copyright and the guarantee of freedom of speech in the constitution
2717503 for anyone who has wondered will i be sued for creating and posting this video online the code of best practices in fair use is an invaluable guide
2717504 bill c 61 attempts to provide balance but misses the boat for ordinary canadians and over 21 million library users

2717506 myspaces 110 million active users potentially represent a very large target for criminals of all kinds including identity thieves
2717507 our guide is designed to raise awareness of the identity theft risks that face myspace users and to provide some simple preventative measures that they can take to protect themselves
2717508 myspace users shouldnt publish anything on their profile page that they wouldnt divulge to a complete stranger
2717509 the benefit to using an escrow service is the safe environment for parties to complete a fair transaction
2717510 unfortunately these internet scammers develop believable stories about their cheap prices or previous track record so you will comply with their services
2717511 regulations throughout the world assign the responsibility for preventing fraud to management
2717512 but beyond regulatory requirements organizations that value ethical behavior as a core principle and actively manage their fraud risks ultimately will be more competitive and earn and preserve a more positive corporate reputation
2717513 preventing fraud requires a dedicated commitment from management this guide provides best practices tools and examples that organizations can use to help manage their fraud risks
2717514 in many cases boards of directors and management do not expect to have fraud in their organizations and articulate that loudly
2717515 but just saying we dont want fraud or we dont tolerate fraud does not ensure that fraud will not occur organizations must take a proactive stance to ensure that effective fraud prevention and detection techniques are properly used in response to key risks
2717516 restrictions on parallel importation have meant that over the past decade millions of dollars have been taken from the wallets of canadians particularly students
2717517 rather than see the cost of textbooks reduced by as much as 15 overnight this act will ensure that canadian students will with little accountability as to where this money goes continue to overpay millions of dollars more in the coming decade
2717518 for true academic success canadian students and the libraries that serve them need to be confident that they will not commit copyright violations as part of the ordinary course of research
2717519 instead of clarifying the legality of fair dealing this legislation obfuscates the situation even more
2717520 the copyright act even with the changes proposed by the government does not strike this balance it remains anti student
2717521 we are very pleased that the bill contains an exception for educational use of internet materials and a notice and notice regime for internet service providers but we do have serious concerns about the implications for higher education institutions of the provisions dealing with circumvention of technological measures and with statutory damages
2717522 professors and students at canadian universities are both creators and users of copyright works so canadian universities recognize the importance of balance between the desire of creators to receive fair remuneration for the use of their works and the public interest in being able to use information for purposes such as research and education
2717523 the bill attempts to strike a balance but in relation to higher education we will be recommending amendments in a couple of areas to ensure appropriate balance

2717529 the copyright alliance was formed with the singular purpose of serving as a collective voice and advocate on behalf of the 11 million americans whose livelihoods depend on the principle of copyright
2717530 i can think of no better way to mark this milestone than to launch an effort to bring more individual voices to the discussion
2717531 the copyright alliance is the only organization in the united states that acts on behalf of all artists and creators in all fields from the performing arts to the written word to software development to promote the importance of copyright and its economic cultural and educational implications for creators and their communities

2717534 this type of malware is causing serious losses for users around the world particularly considering the increased use of online banking services with the millions of online bank users there is a tremendous pool of potential victims for cyber crooks
2717535 if criminals managed to steal just 100 dollars from one percent of the current base of users we would be talking about a haul of tens of millions of dollars and this is a very conservative estimate the reality could be much worse

2717539 is the latest title in the popular rhythm game series and its focus on the veteran boston http news
2717540 if this bill passes it will radically restructure copyright protections currently guaranteed to creators by making it legal for anyone to use reproduce and change a creators painting illustration or photograph without permission fair or appropriate compensation or proper legal remedy
2717541 these bills are a recipe for legal chaos and have numerous large companies expecting to sweep up these orphaned visual materials for free or for minimal payments to the owners and creators
2717542 the bills will excuse thieves from any significant financial liability for such infringement and even allow them to make minor modifications and copyright the original artwork in their name this violates the exclusive rights guaranteed to the original creator under copyright law
2717543 the black fives owned trademarks being used without black fives permission that we know of so far are new york renaissance big r five and rens
2717544 we have a contractual obligation to our existing and potential licensees and sponsors to vigilantly protect our trademarks

2717549 copyright and the copyright act are important policy tools for the promotion of canadas culture and canadians creativity amendments to the copyright act are an important driver of economic growth and a tool to encourage innovation in canada particularly small business as professional photographers we understand first hand the importance of ensuring a modern copyright act that promotes both these objectives
2717550 the proposed updates to the copyright act work toward these objectives making photographers equals among their creative colleagues these amendments allow canadian small business photographers the opportunity to generate additional revenues for their commercial work at the same time they strike a balance by allowing consumers the use of commissioned personal photographs for private non commercial purposes
2717551 knowing microsoft is targeting resellers of illegal software in my area gives me one less thing to worry about
2717552 when the economy is struggling it is difficult to focus on adding value to your customers when other organizations are using unfair practices to gain an advantage especially when it comes to pricing of software
2717553 these legal actions are about protecting microsofts customers from falling victim to some dealers who operate a business model of peddling pirated and counterfeit software
2717554 some companies previously involved in these lawsuits have discontinued their illegal business practices others have not the cases announced today are indicative of the need to ensure that dealers cease their illegal activity so that customers can be sure that they purchase genuine fully licensed software

2717577 certainly losing a couple of players and a few that were sore we had to keep rotating and even getting mcnamara to see if he could give us three or four more minutes to give another player a rest
2717578 and to go on and really battle through that for a young player like that is outstanding
2717579 he didnt question it he was putting his hand up saying i can go out and have a go im about 80 per cent
2717580 that sort of spirit from the team is what you always want to see and i think theres been a couple of games this year where we havent seen it this is what we expect now and this is what should be the norm and what we aim for
2717581 its really just the players being able to look each other in the eye and say we did what we expect from each other
2717582 great things happen when you attack the footy and sometimes things open up for you
2717583 youve just got to have that desire and its great to see a player whos only got a few games left in him still wanting to do that for the team
2717584 i would have thought 12 wins would have to get you into the eight and we are sitting on eight at the moment with only three games to go so it does look extremely unlikely
2717585 we played some very average football in the first half

2717588 everything we feared when bp came to the area has come true
2717589 we have every right to dream heroic dreams we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams
2717590 if i can get you to do what i want then i do not have to force you
2717591 empires function by virtue of the prestige they radiate as well as by might and indeed collapse if they rely on force alone
2717592 the clashes outside the stadiums are likely to be more intense and spectacular than the sports competitions taking place on the inside
2717593 i just get a little bit angry when people use the olympics as their protesting forum it is so removed from politics so why do they use that
2717594 the challenge for an authoritarian regime hosting the world games far greater than it might have imagined
2717595 we the democratically elected leaders of our people hereby declare kosovo to be an independent and sovereign state this declaration reflects the will of our people and it is in full accordance with the recommendations of un special envoy martti ahtisarri
2717596 the global communitys so far tepid embrace of the new republic belgrades efforts to expand its hold over serb areas so as to advance a partition strategy and the failure of international bodies and pristina to coordinate a counter strategy suggest longer term dangers remain very real
2717597 i do not believe the israeli palestinian conflict is solvable
2717598 i simply do not see a resolution that comes out of a negotiating process whereby israelis and palestinians can say yes we will agree to a two state solution i think its too late
2717599 our world is hostage to a struggle between less than one five hundredth of its entire people
2717600 if youre jewish if youre christian and if youre muslim and that involves a large proportion of the worlds population part of your identification goes back to the holy land that shapes your consciousness about who you are where youve come from what your value systems are and what your belief systems are
2717601 what happens between israelis and palestinians shapes economic realities in the world given the fact that perhaps 90 per cent of the goods we consume in our daily life all have oil involved in them in some way it gives us if you like a prosaic interest in what happens between israelis and palestinians and in the middle east more broadly we ignore it at our peril
2717602 if you go back to the civil war in lebanon in the 70s and 80s it wasnt until the point where the lebanese themselves felt so disgusted with what they were doing to each other that there was any chance of them sitting down and making an agreement that would more or less work
2717603 i actually dont see that happening in the israeli palestinian conflict
2717604 its less easy to do for the palestinians but for 60 years the palestinians have lived in an uncertain often hostile environment i think theres not a point reached where palestinians say to themselves the level of violence in our society is so horrific that we have to make a deal because as they see it the deal making process is basically making more concessions to the israelis the terms of their final surrender
2717605 the israeli palestinian question lies at the heart of the arab world view how a lot of arab leaders and arab peoples judge the wider world is shaped by their judgment of its position on the israeli palestinians
2717606 resolving the israeli palestinian conflict wont fix the problem of international terrorism but it will help to drain the swamp its a grievance its a cause it feeds that wider instability in both the arab and indeed the non arab world
2717607 when i say the international community i dont mean just americans or europeans or the other member of the quartet the un and russia i mean the arab world too because the arab world has its own peace plan its part of the international community and they can cajole pressure and entice
2717608 america can exercise an enormous amount of clout and the protection and the support that america offers to israel is obviously of great comfort to israel but i dont buy into the argument that if the us only leaned on israel more i think it ought to lean on israel more in some respects it would fix the problem
2717609 israelis and palestinians have to own the solution they can be helped to that solution by others and the road map and the saudi and the arab league peace proposal is a critical element in that but the israelis and the palestinians are the enemies in this it doesnt really matter what the americans say and it doesnt really matter what the europeans say
2717610 if im the israeli and youre the palestinian weve got to have enough in what we sign on the table for me to want to make it work and you to want to make it work we have to own it
2717611 thats why you need to bring them to the negotiating table
2717612 for the us to say yes were with fatah all the way and pretend that hamas doesnt exist is just loopy
2717613 the level of popular antipathy toward the us is really profound
2717614 the leadership of the sunni arab world certainly wants the us to hang around the middle east
2717615 the picture you painted in herzls nightmare was fairly bleak do you see anything as having changed since you wrote your book
2717616 i think that one of the things that has to happen if there is to be any optimism is that the us has to stop taking a partisan role in palestinian politics
2717617 the palestinians say but hang on youre a jew anywhere in the world you can have a right of return to israel we cant have a right of return the answers no i know thats unfair
2717618 but life is unfair and international politics is unfair it involves painful compromises
2717619 determined refusal to take the issue of settlements as a complicating factor
2717620 youre sitting in the west bank youre in the valleys the settlements are on the hilltops every day you look up and theres a bit more of the west bank land that has been gobbled up to create to thicken to infill israeli settlements
2717621 yes we want these negotiations but do you mind if we just take a bit more of your land

2717660 dna can provide useful information but its by no means predestination
2717661 the key missing ingredient today is the ability to interpret the genetic information and go from that to recommendations about what to do
2717662 it isnt its people who are technophiles and inherently curious about themselves and about science
2717663 ten years from now the complete sequencing of the human genome will be routine
2717664 it will be information thats available to a physician like your blood pressure and your temperature

2717675 a homeowner who has spent at least 31 of their income on a mortgage has an existing high interest sub prime loan with lets say countrywide financial the loan may already be in default as is 48 of countrywides 30 billion sub prime portfolio the borrower can refinance with the new fha on a 30 year fixed rate loan at an interest rate significantly lower than any prime borrower on a conventional basis countrywide agrees to write down their mortgage to 90 of the current appraised value in exchange for a new loan guaranteed by fha the borrower presumably now has a loan that is affordable countrywide owns a loan that is fully valued on its balance sheet and the risk of default is assumed by taxpayers

2717680 our number one concern for 04 is driver turnover our number two concern is driver turnover our number three concern is drivers our number four concern is drivers
2717681 everyone has a driver problem its putting a lid on capacity
2717682 april had started off consistent with the first quarter and the second quarter will be just as strong
2717683 the minute the economy begins to heat up again and they can get rehired at the plant or the construction job theyll go back to that
2717684 our research indicates that much of whats been going on in the trucking industry in the past is more what we might call churning its not that there arent enough drivers but that drivers arent staying with any given fleet very long
2717685 the result is that fleets are constantly losing drivers and constantly spending resources to recruit and train new ones but whats really happening is that their previous drivers are simply going to other fleets and their new drivers are coming from other fleets
2717686 if there truly were a driver shortage we would have expected to see wages rising and tractors sitting idle and we really didnt see that
2717687 they have but not at a very high rate while truck drivers earned three times the wages of fast food workers in the late 1970s they now earn only twice what fast food workers earn
2717688 during the last recession several of the largest trucking companies reduced the entry wages of truck drivers this contrasts to most of the economy where wages dont fall during recessions there is even a famous economics book entitled why wages dont fall during recessions
2717689 trucking has seen smaller wage increases than most of the economy particularly the lower wage parts of the economy
2717690 its going to take money no matter how you cut it
2717691 we hold that the final rule is arbitrary and switching companies
2717692 the most popular social networks are reaching a critical mass which will result in the emergence of much more targeted social networks our target is the health and fitness industry
2717693 unlike many self serving health and fitness communities that preach one philosophy are too clinical or are just one big advertisement the direction of our growth will be determined by our members

2717696 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2717697 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2717698 we could have rebuilt american schools and roads and bridges we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs

2717719 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2717720 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2717721 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2717722 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2717723 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2717724 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2717725 she never trusted me even for the 2 mins we nevr had 10 min of constructed talk i will make sure she pays for that at the end
2717726 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2717727 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2717728 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2717729 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2717730 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2717731 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2717732 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2717733 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2717734 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2717735 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2717736 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2717737 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2717738 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2717739 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2717740 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2717741 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2717742 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2717743 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2717744 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2717745 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2717746 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2717747 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2717748 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2717749 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2717750 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2717751 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2717752 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2717753 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2717754 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2717755 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2717756 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2717757 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2717758 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2717759 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2717760 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2717761 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2717762 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2717763 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2717764 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2717765 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2717766 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2717767 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2717768 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2717769 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2717770 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2717771 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2717772 the team was adjusting to a new coach and a few injuries kept some of our very strong rowers out of action this year which is unfortunate since last years freshman boat was so strong
2717773 injuries definitely plagued our team this year it was a challenging season but it will help the program grow
2717774 we had a really good race for all of our boats in our second race against holy cross and smith
2717775 even though princeton wasnt there it was a great race
2717776 our two boats finished within ten seconds of each other ending up only behind stanford the second varsity eight beat the 2v eight of wisconsin and the first varsity got wisconsins first varsity it was definitely a great race and a lot of fun
2717777 our florida training week was kind of a turning point in the season
2717778 we got a lot of really great workouts in and in mixed lineups that is there was no first boat or second boat we were racing side by side and rowing with different people each day it was a great time that brought the team together
2717779 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2717780 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2717781 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2717782 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2717783 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2717784 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2717785 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2717786 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2717787 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2717788 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2717789 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2717790 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2717791 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2717792 thats not the type of thing he should be doing thats bulk lifting that they had him doing there
2717793 thats exactly what theyve been telling him that he needs to lift and be a powerlifter
2717794 losing a pound was normal to him but because of the bulk lifting stuff he had so many muscles so guess what didnt come off
2717795 its not him losing on the scale theres really more to it than that
2717796 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2717797 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2717798 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot

2717829 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2717830 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2717831 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2717832 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2717833 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2717834 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2717835 hahahahaa das is jetzt aber ganz sch n klischee hahahaha
2717836 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2717837 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2717838 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2717839 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2717840 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2717841 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2717842 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2717843 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2717844 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2717845 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2717846 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2717847 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2717848 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2717849 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2717850 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2717851 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2717852 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2717853 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2717854 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2717855 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2717856 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2717857 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2717858 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2717859 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2717860 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2717861 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2717862 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2717863 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2717864 man this place would be perfect if only the coffee didnt taste like crap
2717865 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2717866 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2717867 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2717868 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2717869 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2717870 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2717871 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2717872 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2717873 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2717874 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2717875 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2717876 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2717877 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2717878 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2717879 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2717880 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2717881 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2717882 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2717883 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2717884 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2717885 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2717886 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2717887 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2717888 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2717889 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2717890 who are open to doing something on the production side
2717891 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2717892 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2717893 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2717894 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2717895 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2717896 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2717897 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2717898 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2717899 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2717900 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2717901 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2717902 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2717903 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2717904 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2717905 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2717906 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2717907 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2717908 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2717909 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2717910 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2717911 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2717912 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2717913 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2717919 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2717920 i love this place i never want to leave here
2717921 ok im going to be straight up with you right from the start
2717922 oh i am sorry this is only for season ticket holders i hear your plight about your dad but i am sorry that i cannot help you
2717923 at amp t park home of the san francisco giants
2717924 i think ill start with a white wine and lets share some garlic fries
2717925 next time the waiter comes around order me an anchor steam and a chicken sandwich
2717926 lets pull out my laptop and connect to the stadiums free wireless
2717927 its like being at a bar with 40 000 other people
2717928 yeah but i bet she is a real push over
2717929 i would have hated to have been in the position scotty was in
2717930 but hes never once complained about it or worried about what any of us have achieved
2717931 joel to a large extent has taken it to another level but scott has always wanted to be his own person and his own player
2717932 scotty is probably more serious about his footy than i was
2717933 thats probably a benefit of being the last in the chain as he has seen a lot of footy and two brothers win premierships
2717934 i know i was focused but he has taken it to a new level people around the club have said his professionalism is the best theyve seen from a first year player for some time
2717935 a bit of touch or some ideas he wants to bounce off me
2717936 it is a real balance because initially you want to take him under your wing and say do this and do that
2717937 but ive also made sure ive distanced myself enough to let coaches give him the information he needs
2717938 i guess it has fast tracked him a little bit having me there but in a sense you also want him to find his own feet
2717939 with adam here i never had any doubts or fears about coming to the club in fact it was probably a relief more than anything
2717940 i always keep my eye on him to make sure hes doing the right thing
2717941 if i thought he was being thrown to the wolves i would definitely be a bit more hesitant but i knew he was ready
2717942 when we are all 30 and weve got all our stories and broken bones well be able to say joel yeah you may have won a brownlow medal but scotty and i got to play in a premiership together
2717943 one of the best burgers and definitely the best fries in the city
2717944 yeah they want to meet us somewhere and i said the zeitgeist
2717945 yeah but i think they will be afraid of the zeitgeist as 9

2717947 why in the hell does anyone need to know this about me
2717948 describe your childhood 1 my family was close tight knit with a strong sense of values 2 childhood was easy and free 3 i came from a strict yet loving environment 4 we did our own thing what are rules anyway 5 my family wasnt at all close emotions werent expressed and i often found myself alone relying on my imagination and playing war alot
2717949 that worries me given the fact that you have to verbally argue appeals on a daily basis maybe this is why your productivity levels arent where they should be
2717950 did you perhaps consider that although the questions were worded similarly that perhaps some situations applied to work and home and there are two different personalities in that job im more agressive at home because that is where i make the rules and here i go by the rules which doesnt allow a lot of wiggle room so im passive in that regard as not being able to be too inventive to get out of situations like that
2717951 but if i wasnt there when service was discontinued why do i have to be there to have it restored
2717952 you dont have to be there but this statement basically gives permission for us to turn back on without you being there its a legality hence the unlikely event just make sure the things i specified are taken care of and everything should be fine
2717953 yeah im here to find out if i have a personality
2717954 list in sequential order what appeals to you or your situation be honest there are no right or wrong answers on this test so just relax have fun and find out how you communicate and why

2717959 but when he saw the wind he was afraid and beginning to sink
2717960 when i got here people spoke very highly of barry
2717961 hitch coach ken hitchcock really liked him and it was obvious barry had gained credibility with the players
2717962 it was nothing to come home from school and find 20 kids in the house with brothers inviting their friends over to play

2717975 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2717976 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2717977 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis

2718055 el programa si mal no recuerdo era todo o casi todo beethoven no s exactamente que toc pero s recuerdo la sonata apassionata sa la recuerdo clarito porque escuch ndola esa noche fue cuando me enamor de gabriela montero que carlos duarte ni que ocho cuartos
2718056 al final del recital y despu s de unas rondas de aplausos llega gabriela y dice voy a hacer algo ahora que nunca hice antes en p blico voy a improvisar quiz s dijo que no hago hace mucho no s igual lo que dijo me impresion
2718057 como si ya no hubiese roto suficientes reglas esa noche se iba a poner a inventar cual si fuera un jazzista tripeando con un saxof n en un bar de new orleans all con su steinway y en plena sala r os reyna
2718058 se sent en el piano pas como un minuto en silencio y comenz a tocar

2718102 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2718103 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2718104 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

2718109 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2718110 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2718111 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2718112 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2718113 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2718114 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2718115 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2718116 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2718117 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2718118 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2718119 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2718120 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success

2718133 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2718134 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2718135 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2718136 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2718137 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2718138 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2718139 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2718140 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2718142 oh yes the cloud of betrayal was floating between us when you divorced jim and decided to go away to find yourself our great inseparable friendship could not hold you here i can understand that but i could not understand why were you so secretive the fact that you did not tell your best friend where you will be broke the powerful bond we had you know that you were the first person i invited to come to my cabin that is surely the sign of deep friendship i could not tell you what i felt and thought i am going to tell you now even though you are just my memory of you in this chair hmm than how can you have a conversation with me if i am not there this is the only way i can tell you the truth i was very excited jim drove me to your cabin in the backwoods of west virginia we drove as far as the car would go then we started walking through the wilderness on a narrow path that only one person could walk often sideways more than half an hour later we arrived both out of breath i had mosquito and some unknown bugs bites i do get hysterical about that all i wanted to do is to hug you and take a shower immediately what i saw took my breath away first time in our lives i had to be a hypocrite what is happening to you this is not a cabin this is a shack you even do not have a shower or a bathroom
2718143 gee i cannot believe that people heat their stoves with saw dust this is 21 i do not use electricity i have as many environment friendly things as possible
2718144 what happens when you need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night i wanted to leave immediately but could not hurt your feelings about your deep love for your miserable primitive life style
2718145 you certainly escaped from the hurly burly of civilized life

2718186 white northerners had a rather complacent and self satisfied attitude that anti black prejudice and anti black violence in particular was largely a southern problem and one of the really shocking things about the well publicized springfield race riot and its association with abraham lincoln was that the north had a race problem
2718187 they clearly wanted to mete out lethal justice there on the spot
2718188 went from one end to the other looting homes damaging homes and ultimately setting them on fire by the time they were through theyd displaced at least 40 families
2718189 largely working class rioters were expressing resentment over visible black success and influence in the community
2718190 from the perspective of many springfield residents who were white justice was not done in the end
2718191 liberals in the north were so outraged by the symbolism of this violence occurring in lincolns hometown that they got together called a series of meetings and announced their intent on lincolns birthday in 1909 to form a new organization whose prime initial goal would be to fight anti black violence

2718216 dmdc was evaluated by the scf in 1990 and considered acceptable for the cold sterilization of soft drinks and fruit juices at levels of addition up to 250 mg l 1 dmdc decomposes primarily to co2 and methanol the use of 200 mg dmdc l would add 98 mg l of methanol to wine which already contains an average of about 140 mg l from natural sources a healthy person metabolises 1500 mg methanol hr without any physiological problems and this should be compared to the amount of up to 240 mg l methanol in wine treated with dmdc up to 200 mg l metabolism of the amounts of methanol resulting from consumption of wine containing such levels is therefore well within the capacity of the human body thus consumption of even large quantities of wine would not pose any hazards from methanol conclusion the formation of methanol and other reaction products following the use of dmdc for the treatment of alcoholic beverages and wine is similar to that formed in non alcoholic beverages therefore the previous opinion on the use of dmdc for non alcoholic beverages 1 is equally applicable to wines treated with dmdc

2718385 i had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginning i didnt think we had done enough in the diplomatic area
2718386 i cannot support a failed foreign policy history teaches us that it is often easier to make war than peace this administration is just learning that lesson right now the president began this mission with very vague objectives and lots of unanswered questions a month later these questions are still unanswered there are no clarified rules of engagement there is no timetable there is no legitimate definition of victory there is no contingency plan for mission creep there is no clear funding program there is no agenda to bolster our over extended military there is no explanation defining what vital national interests are at stake there was no strategic plan for war when the president started this thing and there still is no plan today
2718387 no goal no objective not until we have those things and a compelling case is made then i say back out of it because innocent people are going to die for nothing thats why im against it

2718440 with a steadily increasing number of homes to choose from prospective buyers are remaining on the fence and are hesitant to commit many are waiting for the absolute bottoming out of the market but we as realtors know that this is not easily predicted
2718441 there are definitely some key factors contributing to the market slow down but buyers must realize that this is a good time to buy home pricing remains competitive in an effort to attract recently lowered interest rates may convince some of those hesitant buyers to move
2718442 defaults are on the rise in most parts of the country but it is not always the case of a homeowner losing his or her home
2718443 but its often the case of an investor gambling on a continued increase in home values and losing that gamble
2718444 california nevada arizona and florida were among the states with the fastest home price appreciation over the last five years this attracted both speculators and home builders a volatile combination that led to an over supply of homes that was beyond the capacity of the local populations to support
2718445 when this over supply became apparent and prices began to fall many of these investors simply walked away from their mortgages
2718446 despite the overall increase in the statewide median price prices declined in 11 regions last month falling 11 5 percent in the central valley region and 12 1 percent in sacramento
2718447 price softness is even more pronounced when we look at different segments of the market for example the statewide median price in the entry level price range of less than 500 000 fell 5 1 percent in august to 349 360 compared with 368 210 for the same period a year ago
2718448 the median price per square foot for a single family home is also on the decline falling 4 3 percent this year to 336 compared with last years record high of 351 per square foot
2718449 while low affordability tighter underwriting standards and expectations of lower prices continue to pose challenges for the market the decline in sales accelerated in august as a result of the so called credit or liquidity crunch that began in july
2718450 the credit crunch emerged as uncertainty about the extent of the subprime problem drove investors across the globe to turn off the tap of funds to lenders in mortgage and other credit market segments with credit drying up even qualified buyers were unable to receive funding for home purchases
2718451 we expect the impact of the credit crunch to play out over the next several months and that it will continue to negatively impact sales
2718452 however it is too early to say if home sales have already passed bottom
2718453 still major declines in home sales are likely to have occurred already and further declines if any are likely to be modest given the accumulating pent up demand

2718464 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2718465 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2718466 intela offers a variety of services for advertisers and publishers alike our clients span the globe across verticals that include travel entertainment finance education and more
2718467 we leverage more than a decade of experience uniting advertisers and publishers for optimal results
2718468 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2718469 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2718470 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2718471 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2718472 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2718518 when i heard that brian hyland was in town i tracked him down to the damansara westpoint club where he was performing and they told me that he was staying at the merlin now concorde kl
2718519 i called him at the hotel and asked for an interview for newscast a tape news magazine for the blind and he obliged and told me to meet him at the hotel the next day
2718520 never have i ever imagined that i would have the chance to perform a number on stage with brian
2718521 this is where the action is and if im ever going to make it to the big time ill have to be a success here first
2718522 my friend matthew josef sent me to rtm with a reference letter and i thought that it was for a regular job
2718523 i never even dreamed that he wanted me to take part in the contest
2718524 so i decided that my singing career deserved my wholehearted attention moreover keeping two jobs was very taxing and left me with almost no time for myself
2718525 no it was his distinctive voice that got him where he is
2718526 i was really grateful to patrick for taking the initiative during his radio deejaying days to play my songs says the 42 year old singer but it has been ages since he penned songs
2718527 alfred should compose more songs hes talented know what his excuse is lazy can you beat that

2718529 quote keep this between us albert is a very dis organised person unquote
2718530 i do this real moron thing its called thinking because i like to form my own opinions
2718531 while force refers to the act of compelling constraining or obliging someone to do something free will or voluntary action refers to acting without constraint or expectation of reward
2718532 society seems to be designed in such a way that even voluntary actions ends up in force
2718533 there is always a group of people in society who cannot be reasoned with thats where force becomes necessary
2718534 individual freedom is important but there has to be a balance between force and free will without force no order can be achieved
2718535 we tend to confuse academics with education academics is only a small portion of education
2718536 education per se today only imparts technical job skills it needs to be more holistic in nature it should impart information that would really be relevant to our future life
2718537 some people seek to educate their children differently through music through art through home schooling etc are these methods of education wrong
2718538 i dont know what education is it is such a vague term is education knowledge
2718539 to escape the mundane and the oh how boring life is
2718540 i can not imagine life without movies without stuffs like lage raho munnabhai bheja fry and there are many we are just addicted to movies
2718541 with all the negative connotations attached with the word escapism it is difficult to think if it can mean something good a virtue
2718542 its not important to even think why we are watching movies that we watch them because we want to watch them and they are quite a variety of them to be watched are reasons enough period
2718543 hindi cinema and its characters are more escapist or are treated like that by movie makers to be so devanand starring
2718544 modern devdas is the most apt example of escapism that is more or less regular fixture in hindi cinema we like and sympathise with the characters battered by the world characters that are surviving the life not living it
2718545 i would have never thought of preparing for the ias had it not been for the pressure of my friends who are preparing hard to get into ias its the parental pressure as well
2718546 we tend to make the sense of who we are from what we have achieved and accomplished compared to our peers and cohorts that underpins the peer pressure and in my case peer pressure has been a positive force because it has made me strive to be the best
2718547 i am now contemplating about going for mba something unthought of one month back i admit its peer pressure
2718548 we form peer some years before we enter into our teens time when we want ourselves to be wanted and accepted not among the family members but with people of our age who we go out to play
2718549 since the relationship with our parents and siblings is hierarchical and vertical and the relationship with our friends is egalitarian and horizontal we during our teen age through early twenties prefer friends circle to family
2718550 its the fear of exclusion that make us be loyal to our particular friends circle so if its trendy
2718551 those who are not accepted and wanted and marginalized by the friends tend to come together and its mostly this set of individuals who get into anti socail activities
2718552 i have never let my schooling interfere with my education

2718582 letztendlich m ssen die frauen sich eine bessere position im berufsleben erk mpfen
2718583 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2718584 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
2718585 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing
2718586 buckling down and pressing my secret to its fullest potential
2718587 well see just how long i can make it available before it saturates things
2718588 hes already so amazingly rich that whether he continues or discontinues its sale will neither make nor break the man but not grabbing it for yourself while its still available could prove disastrous for you as you may only have one chance and a very limited one at that to get this
2718589 we are launching music onebox to give users an easy and legal way to find the music theyre looking for and to give music labels and publishers a new channel to distribute promote and make money off of their valuable music content

2718595 i think this is very good timing to start thinking about this
2718596 they were just brought in and nothing was done to help them in terms of welfare afterwards
2718597 then people blame the foreigners for the problems even though its japan that invited them here and didnt do anything for them

2718600 despite the plethora of information available on specific methods and procedures that can allow you to achieve a solid income online so many people still struggle many never making any money online at all the reasons for this are many and varied but were going to look at just a few today 1 this is the biggest and least acknowledged of them all mental influences most people dont make the money they want because they have mental barriers that prevent them from acquiring it perhaps they think subconsciously that if they have more money theyll have to spend more money or that theyll have less time to spend with their families or theyll become greedy or that they wont know what to do with the money or they will get robbed or some other outlandish negative consequence will arise these negative belief barriers must be broken down before someone can have the things that they consciously want to be abundant in their life where you are is where you want to be so the saying goes if youve been trying a long time without making any decent money online the inside might be the first place to look 2 lack of a solid method while there are a lot of ebooks and courses available on how to achieve the outcome of online income many of them talk theory and fluff while only a few lay out a plan in exact step by step fashion either that or they give you instructions but leave out just one vital step that makes it so difficult to complete the process 3 competing with the big guys if youre getting started its almost impossible to make money by competing against people who are twenty times more experienced than you if you are just getting started and trying to sell internet marketing products as an affiliate as a product creator using seo using ppc whatever the method entering a market where everyone else is better than you is going to ensure you fail even entering other markets is futile dog training acne pregnancy they seem like niche markets but they are nothing of the sort people who succeed know how to effectively target niche markets and penetrate tiny but profitable crevices of the world wide web to find the easy money that may just be one of the best pieces of advice a new online marketer could receive the point is despite the loads of crap out there despite the million ebooks courses memberships and reports on how to make money online with so little success it can be done with a combination of the right mindset and the right approace anything including making a truck load of cash while working from home in your undies can become a reality

2718634 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done
2718635 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
2718636 saying you know lets take another look at this phantom guy
2718637 a lot of people are responding to superheroes obviously just look at comic con and phantom was one of the first costumed superheroes hes a little bit more hardcore than other superheroes in that he packs guns and has martial arts training to kill military style
2718638 we upgraded everything so that its a modern day phantom
2718639 in the tradition of the phantom its going to be a great adventure story its going to be action and car chases hes still got a purple costume but we upgraded it we made it tougher and hes got both rings and they mark you just like the original story but were updating everything to make it more modern
2718640 in our story we have a break in the lineage the 22nd phantom the one we all know and love his wife and his son died in an automobile accident so when he died there was no one to take over
2718641 but it turns out the son survived and has been raised by a foster family and has no idea who he is they find him through a fluke when hes arrested on a trespassing charge and he ends up getting his dna into codis the national dna database the people in bangalla who are still part of the jungle patrol which we call bpaa thap which literally translates to jungle patrol they find him and decide to bring him in and train him so its a whole new game for this kid so hes very conflicted as far as who he was and who he thinks he is
2718642 theyve evolved into this huge corporate entity after the death of the 22nd phantom which takes place 14 years before our story that gap without a phantom led to everything horrible thats happening today its the singh brotherhood behind it
2718643 their whole thing is that if they can keep people at war theyll make money theyre fomenting distrust between various nations and factions and just making sure that there are always bad things happening but our lead bad guy is raatib singh and hes a corporate animal
2718644 youll see something deeper to him that makes him much more twisted than your average corporate bad guy
2718645 like when somebody gets into an argument with him instead of doing something like spreading rumors about him sleeping with another guys wife hell shoot him in the face hes a really twisted character hes a psychopath
2718646 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done
2718647 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back

2718664 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2718665 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2718679 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2718680 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2718688 first they look at your history and lithuanian language state exam results then your english lithuanian history and computer science results from the secondary school however the key factor is the creative competition which consists of the essay of the chosen subject and the interview with the committee there are a few committees of either accredited journalists or media experts
2718689 i think the process of admission in lithuania is acceptable because with the essay they check your writing skills and grammar while the interview identifies students awareness and education in general orientation as well as logics in different aspects
2718690 they were making comments about my looks and were literally provoking me it seems like cynicism and insolence is what they expect from their future journalists doorstep peoples homes or search for scandalous stories they indirectly told me that i am just wasting my time all places have been sold already

2718763 question of the violation of human rights in the occupied arab territories including palestine
2718764 there must be some limit to the extent to which human rights may be violated in the name of counter terrorism
2718765 so remote from the interests of security that it assumes the character of punishment humiliation and conquest
2718766 idf documents indicate that most of the suicide terrorists and car bombs crossed the seam area into israel through the checkpoints

2718771 the settlements it seeks to protect the wall is manifestly intended to create facts on the ground
2718772 checkpoints closures and curfews are words that fail to capture the full enormity of what is happening today in the west bank and gaza
2718773 accounts of rudeness humiliation and brutality at the checkpoints are legion

2718775 a humanitarian crisis in the west bank and gaza it is not the result of a natural disaster instead it is a crisis imposed by a powerful state on its neighbour
2718776 international humanitarian law seeks to limit harm to civilians by requiring that all parties to a conflict respect the principles of distinction and proportionality
2718777 which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated
2718778 failure to attempt such arrests inevitably gives rise to suspicions that israel lacks evidence to place such persons on trial and therefore prefers to dispose of them arbitrarily

2718780 the bulldozer has become as much of a symbol of israeli occupation as the rifle and the tank
2718781 a government policy by which we are to advance and develop communities in judea and samaria in accordance with needs and natural growth
2718782 evidence strongly suggests that israel is determined to create facts on the ground amounting to de facto annexation
2718783 the time has come to condemn the wall as an unlawful act of annexation in the same way that israels annexation of east jerusalem and the golan heights has been condemned as unlawful
2718784 it is clear that the lord is hardening the hearts of israels enemies the lord hardened the heart of pharoah so that he would not let the people go
2718785 all will be well because the most high god is with us

2718806 do you forget that palestinian arabs receive more money thru foreign aid than any people group on the planet the people themselves often get little of it because of corrupt leadership

2718814 for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing and yet they would not hear
2718815 these figures show we can no longer cross our fingers and hope this is a blip we have now reached crisis point in the number of people at risk of repossession and alarm bells must be ringing in government
2718816 we believe these new figures paint a terrifying picture showing real people hard working families young first time buyers and even renters all living in the shadow of repossession and ultimately homelessness
2718817 at shelter we see many homeowners owing very small amounts of money whose lives are wrecked by some particularly sub prime lenders racing to repossess
2718818 we are particularly concerned by the reports new evidence that there is a huge disparity in lending and arrears management practices which leave many homeowners at risk of repossession in cases where a solution could have been found

2718820 ber den weiteren verlauf der hochzeitsnacht ist leider nichts bekannt
2718821 although the theme sounds incredibly sad i think that the film still has wide audience potential seriousness and sadness can indeed open the door to humour compassion and longing strong emotions on which some of the greatest films are based
2718822 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death
2718823 but along the way scores of others terrorists foreigners academic researchers biowarfare specialists and an elite group of army scientists working behind high fences and barbed wire drew the interest of the investigators
2718824 whoever you are from wherever you are how you are welcome
2718825 the thrust of this campaign was set months ago and is continuing forward theres no special plan to change that
2718826 were not here to watch what our competitors do were here to run our own race
2718827 were like latinos but we work with a swiss touch
2718828 madrid is a sure bet in all senses its a country that is open to all rights to all cultures
2718829 i wasnt on fire i was just three for three on three pointers
2718830 it was actually a simple shot its very special to beat argentina in our first game
2718831 its not an upset in the sense that we couldnt lose to them theyre a great team and we knew it
2718832 the first game of an olympics is always the most difficult
2718833 but pau gasol is improving so the expectation is high
2718834 a fortune teller told me if i changed my name i would go far so i changed it because i wanted to go to the olympics
2718835 last time i didnt make it and now i wanted to go in
2718836 to god almighty and that you dont give an inch of land that jevovah gave in covenant to abraham issac and jacob the land is yours given by the one who never changes his mind given by the one who lives forever
2718837 any man with his witts about him can see that the world is cold dead and unending
2718838 immense beauty and spiritualism found within our own personal connections to the world in wich we live
2718839 for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse
2718840 the existence and nature of god is discernible simply by looking around you at his creation
2718841 9 hence all faithful christians are forbidden to defend as the legitimate conclusions of science those opinions which are known to be contrary to the doctrine of faith particularly if they have been condemned by the church and furthermore they are absolutely bound to hold them to be errors which wear the deceptive appearance of truth
2718842 my hope is that god will use this to ignite a zeal for israel and things jewish among my gentile brethren
2718843 is a quote from some ancient religious scribe of sort the bible maybe but wich bible you site no source here who said this god jesus the pope
2718844 but for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death
2718845 that if you confess with your mouth jesus as lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
2718846 a fool does not delight in understanding but only in revealing his own mind
2718847 maybe then you will see why your hated all over the world
2718848 someone from your neighborhood launches a mortar from their rooftop at a crowded neighborhood nearby
2718849 the white minority discriminated against blacks simply for being black in israel the jewish majority sometimes limits the freedom of movement of arabs not because they are arabs but in an attempt to stop mass terror attacks against civilians
2718850 your contention that israel has been violating international law since 1967 by building settlements and putting up road blocks us incorrect
2718851 here is a proverb for those neighbors you take fire into your bosom you get burnt
2718852 germany was the initial biligerent a recognized state with a massive war industry backing it up
2718853 drive the jews into the sea on behalf of several middle eastern states they should be thankful israel does not deal with the source and attack tehren damascus and cairo
2718854 the whole world except u s and israel would beg to differ
2718855 i wonder what hamas militants would do to you and your family if you informed local israeli soldiers at a checkpoint
2718856 i think its pretty clear none of us has ever been in west bank or gaza
2718857 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof
2718858 yes it is as you say in the future you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of god and coming on the clouds of heaven
2718859 unfortunately those that are have been terrorized into silence by their murderous neighbors and have been ignored and left to their fate by westerners like you who prefer to defend the terrorists who make their lives miserable
2718860 the hanging of the two spies is an ordinary legal action of a court of the underground which has sentenced and will sentence the criminals who belong to the criminal nazi british army of occupation
2718861 its the solution that brings about peace not the other way around
2718862 as long as they reject jesus christ they are enemies of god its time to stop this insane zionist crap and start sharing the gospel of christ with people who are going to hell
2718863 the last of this generation shall not pass before the kingdom of god is on earth
2718864 call on him while he is near for today is the day of salvation no man is sure of tomorrow
2718865 its time for these scales to come off as we are coming to the days just before the return of messiah
2718866 the worst kind of antisemitism is to believe or teach that jews do not need to hear about the life giving gospel of jesus christ
2718867 its time to stop this insane zionist crap and start sharing the gospel of christ with people who are going to hell
2718868 how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed how will they believe in him whom they have not heard and how will they hear without a preacher
2718869 so faith comes from hearing and hearing by the word of christ
2718870 but i have to ask myself how someone whos seen what ordinary palestinians go through everyday in their struggle to survive in that diced up puzzle of a land that used to be the land they lived in for 2000 years
2718871 about the palestinian militants any use of force against civilian population is inexcusable random rockets serve no purpose other than terrorize the civilians theyre aimed at and push moderate israelis farther to the right they are just as wrong as the israeli response to it
2718872 can sit and judge a people for defending their right to live in it however wrong their methods are
2718873 thousands of wealthy arabs left in anticipation of a war thousands more responded to arab leaders calls to get out of the way of the advancing armies a handful were expelled but most simply fled to avoid being caught in the cross fire of a battle
2718874 in our political argument abroad we minimize the arab opposition to us let us not ignore the truth among ourselves politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves the country is theirs because they inhabit it whereas we want to come here and settle down and in their view we want to take away from them their country while we are still outside
2718875 is an active resistance by the palestinians to what they regard as a usurpation of their homeland by the jews behind the terrorism is a movement which though primitive is not devoid of idealism and self sacrifice
2718876 but yes i believe israel does have a right to exist
2718877 israel has steadfastly refused refugee right of return you cant deny that
2718878 there is no other name under heaven by which men are saved
2718879 do not fear abram i am a shield to you
2718880 now look toward the heavens and count the stars if you are able to count them
2718881 i am the lord who brought you out of ur of the chaldeans to give you this land to possess it
2718882 then he jesus opened their disciples minds to understand the scriptures
2718883 lord is it at this time you are restoring the kingdom to israel
2718884 it is not for you to know times or epochs which the father has fixed by his own authority
2718885 but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be my witnesses both in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth
2718886 i will pour out on the house of david and on the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication so that they will look on me whom they have pierced and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only son and they will weep bitterly over him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn
2718887 for i do not want you brethren to be uninformed of this mystery so that you will not be wise in your own estimation that a partial hardening has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles has come in
2718888 the deliverer will come from zion he will remove ungodliness from jacob
2718889 for the gifts and the calling of god are irrevocable
2718890 for i do not want you brethren to be uninformed of this mystery so that you will not be wise in your own estimation that a partial hardening has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles has come in
2718891 the deliverer will come from zion he will remove ungodliness from jacob
2718892 the bloodline jewish is so diluted that no one can claim to be a descendent of abraham
2718893 thus says the lord who gives the sun for light by day and the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar the lord of hosts is his name
2718894 then the offspring of israel also will cease from being a nation before me forever
2718895 so why are we to believe their is a separation between israel and the church gentiles when both jew and gentile are all united in christ by faith
2718896 this generation will in no wise pass away before all these things have occurred
2718897 we will go with you for we have heard that god is with you
2718898 is not all about israel as many of you readers might suggest but is all about christ and his gospel
2718899 they take so literal the word that they belive god will rescue them in the end all along not understanding that hundreds of these poor souls are dying each year outside of christ
2718900 controversial us academic held overnight at ben gurion airport for questioning denied entry due to security considerations

2718908 the l rd said unto abram lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art
2718909 unlike other christian evangelical organizations whose raison detre is to persuade jews to embrace the teachings of jesus and to convert cufi lauds the jewish faith and tradition and exhorts jews to return to g d and the timeless teachings of the torah
2718910 hear o israel the lord is our god the lord is one you shall love the lord your god with all of your heart soul mind and strength and you shall love your neighbor as yourself upon these two commandments pivot the torah law and the neevim prophets
2718911 its time for the church to wake up and realize the jewish people have no reason to believe us when we promote an idealism that says you no longer need to be jewish or keep the torah if you believe in yeshua
2718912 therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a sabbath day
2718913 one person regards one day above another another regards every day alike each person must be fully convinced in his own mind he who observes the day observes it for the lord and he who eats does so for the lord for he gives thanks to god and he who eats not for the lord he does not eat and gives thanks to god
2718914 our plan went back more than 12 months in terms of what we were going to do today
2718915 sharon laws and emma pooley and i were all part of a team and we all knew we were good riders but the best chance we had was to ride together and try to win as a team
2718916 riding as a team was the best way to be successful
2718917 it wasnt just her the whole team got it spot on
2718918 i was just so happy and there were so many emotions that were coming out all at once that i probably wasnt composed enough to take my hands off the bars and do a salute that way

2718920 with the knee you must watch poses that incorporate extreme bending or rotation especially when those movements are combined
2718921 the knee is basically two bones sitting on top of each other its good for mobility but not for strength or stability
2718922 it would keep all those bottles under control when i admitted i did not know how to go about it she said she had an architect friend who could do the design and a carpenter friend who worked at the bbc who could put it together in his spare time
2718923 climb the mountains and get their good tidings natures peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees the winds will blow their own freshness into you and the storms their energy while cares will drop off like autumn leaves
2718924 i think in the future we could pick one or two players to be stars
2718925 but right now its about the team however carli is exceptional on the ball she has all the tools she could be a star of the future

2719019 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
2719020 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
2719021 i have never needed to terminate an attorney and none of the attorneys i hired has left
2719022 qtel has not made any request to replace any directors atindosat
2719023 the board of directors isappointed by indosats board of commissioners not qtel
2719024 is consistent with the dominant cultural view of men as breadwinners such that those with greater family responsibilities put in more hours to earn more money
2719025 hey maybe if i make something to keep some water in and put it in some conspicuous place the birds will come and do those things in it too

2719027 right now we have offers from three teams for pablo lvarez but the decision does not come down to us
2719028 at times we looked like the home side and we had them on the rack
2719029 unfortunately a few seconds into the second half a refereeing decision to give them a penalty changed the face of the game
2719030 ive counted seven or eight good chances to score and either poor technique or poor decision to have another touch instead of putting it in the back of the net has cost us
2719031 ive been told the club want me but then when i talk about a new contract they arent interested so ive been left confused
2719032 i spoke to fulham about an extended contract and they werent willing to give me one until i came closer to the end of my current deal
2719033 ive got two years left and i felt it was a normal time to start talking about a new one two years isnt long in football terms
2719034 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2719035 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2719036 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2719037 wir haben uns von einem begeisterten kollegen best rkt im februar 2007 angemeldet und seither jeden monat hoffnungsvoll knapp sechs euro abbuchen lassen doch was sich als kontaktplattfom ausgab hat sich als private kontaktplattform zeitvernichtungsmaschine und panoptikum des lebens erwiesen von business fast keine spur wenn man nicht auf stellensuche ist
2719038 doch gesch fte haben wir nicht gemacht unsere eigenen anl ufe bei den in foren oder nach suchworten entdeckten mitgliedern verliefen im sande denn hier tummeln sich berwiegend freiberufler anw lte sachbearbeiter oder die unteren f hrungsebene der industrie die vermutlich personalberater oder konkurrenz k dern wollen auff llig sind auch die zahlreichen meist weiblichen coaches die von esoterik ber klangschalen massagen bis hin zu fern stlichen k rpertechniken alles anbieten was gestressten gesch ftsleuten seelische und k rperliche erleichterung bringen k nnte oft als kleiner zuverdienst

2719040 trotzdem findet sich auch sinnvolles hilfe beim umgang mit dem computer fundiertes von anw lten ber rechtsfragen im internet tipps zur vermarktung von b chern und vieles mehr doch wer sich die m he macht nur in einigen foren die wichtigsten themen mitzulesen braucht viel zeit
2719041 auch wenn es nur ein gef hl ist so scheint es als ob das niveau der diskussionen schleichend sinkt denn die neuen stellen fragen und bringen wenig ein die alten sind m de und haben keine lust mehr immer wieder dieselben fragen zu beantworten
2719042 as the situation becomes increasingly dire for the newspaper industry everyones looking for a groundbreaking new business model to save the day im sorry that the concept ive presented here isnt the answer but it is a part of the answer
2719043 iraqis are combating terrorism with one hand and building a democratic state with the other and this is not an easy job
2719044 we have carried messages to all the countries we visited that iraq is in need of reconstruction in all fields including railways oil electricity bridges and housing
2719045 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions
2719046 the world record at trials was a shock for me and i really came into olympics with a lot more confidence than the trials
2719047 it was a new race for me and i think you really had to go into it with a new mindset
2719048 its a small victory for my people but when it comes to sports well always remain friends
2719049 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia
2719050 georgia calls upon the international community to make it clear to russia that intrusion into and bombing of the territory of a sovereign state is unacceptable in the 21st century and that such acts cannot and will not be tolerated
2719051 descent thrusters clearing dirt from a smooth patch of either ice or rock
2719052 when the blue star kachina makes its appearance in the heavens the fifth world will emerge
2719053 that from it would spring the glorious envelope in which the spirit soul ka would take its abode
2719054 the story of the blue kachina is a very old story very old
2719055 it was told to me that first the blue kachina would start to be seen at the dances and would make his appearance known to the children in the plaza during the night dance
2719056 in the final days we will look up in our heavens and we will witness the return of the two brothers who helped create this world in the birthing time
2719057 this fact is evidenced in many petraglyphs that speak of the zodiac and within the mayan and egyptian pyramids
2719058 the return of the blue star katchina who is also known as nan ga sohu will be the alarm clock that tells us of the new day and new way of life a new world that is coming
2719059 not far behind the twins will come the purifier the red katchina who will bring the day of purification
2719060 the messages will be found written in the living stone through the sacred grains and even the waters
2719061 those who return to the ways given to us in the original teachings and live a natural way of life will not be touched by the coming of the purifier they will survive and build the new world only in the ancient teachings will the ability to understand the messages be found
2719062 it is important to understand that these messages will be found upon every living thing even within our bodies even within a drop of our blood
2719063 many will appear to have lost their souls in these final days
2719064 only those who return to the values of the old ways will be able to find peace of mind
2719065 as we get close to the time of arrival the purifier there will be those who walk as ghosts through the cities through canyons they will have constructed in their man made mountains
2719066 after the arrival of the twins they will begin to vanish before your eyes like so muck smoke
2719067 life will get very perverted and there will be little social order in these times many will ask for the mountains themselves to fall upon them just to end their misery
2719068 when the purifier comes we will see him first as a small red star which will come very close and sit in our heavens watching us watching us to see how well we have remembered the sacred teachings
2719069 this purifier will show us many miraculous signs in our heavens in this way we will know creator is not a dream even those who do not feel their connection to spirit will see the face of creator across the sky things unseen will be felt very strongly
2719070 many things will begin to occur that will not make sense for reality will be shifting back in and out of the dream state
2719071 we will receive many warnings allowing us to change our ways from below the earth as well as above
2719072 there will be many strange beasts upon the earth in those days some from the past and some that we have never seen
2719073 no thing living will go untouched here or in the heavens
2719074 note reality is a metaphor in which we quest to find answers to the greater truth of who we are and why we are here
2719075 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2719076 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2719077 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2719078 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2719079 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2719080 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2719081 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2719082 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2719083 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2719084 the blood shed in south ossetia will remain on the conscience of these people and their entourage we will not allow anyone to do harm to our peacekeepers and citizens of the russian federation
2719085 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
2719086 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2719087 theres something special about hearing your national anthem when your phone rings its an easy way to feel part of the olympics and you dont have to fly all the way to beijing

2719091 are you too deeply occupied to say if my verse is alive
2719092 high in the sky poised in the right place over everything that clustered below the most felicitous object in boston the gilded dome of the state house
2719093 two months after marching through boston half the regiment was dead at the dedication william james could almost hear the bronze negroes breathe their monument sticks like a fishbone in the citys throat
2719094 the coming out season for boston debutantes began with a sunday luncheon given by emily and roger at their joy street house a function very lavish of its kind but almost immediately eclipsed by the elaborate dinner which old mrs forbes gave on louisburg square
2719095 over the crest and then down joy street the steep descent increases once you walk past the infamous cross street of pinckney long ago designed effectively to separate the elite side of beacon hill from the north slope where the poor servants and tradespeople lived which before the civil war was one of the largest free black communities in america warm lights from smith court spill out into the dark street the old center of black boston
2719096 one of the commonest boy games of winter inherited directly from the eighteenth century was a game of war on boston common in old days the two hostile forces were called north enders and south enders in 1850 it was a battle of the latin school against all comers
2719097 almost the entire square between the backs of beacon river and mt
2719098 in the summer of 1960 bostons west end was bulldozed to rubble when the dust cleared there was charles river park the tall pale buildings had no ties to new england so to grab some local flavor they named the towers after hawthorne whittier emerson lowell and longfellow i like to imagine those old dead white guys rolling in their graves not to mention stogie smoking amy lowell
2719099 miss pride said there was no time today to acquaint me with bostons points of interest but she would show me the one thing which she had always felt was the jewel of the city she would not care about the destruction of everything else the first church or the gardens or kings chapel if only the granary burying ground were preserved
2719100 having awakened from imagining a futurist boston i reached washington street at the busiest point and there i stood and laughed aloud
2719101 the music hall now orpheum theater struck basil with a kind of roman vastness the doors which opened out of the upper balconies high aloft and which were constantly swinging to and fro with the passage of spectators and ushers reminded him of the vomitoria that he had read about in descriptions of the colosseum
2719102 this morning once within the old city hall progress had been slow there were more well wishers lining mayor skeffingtons path from the outer door he made a short speech thanking all those assembled for their anticipated support in the campaign to come
2719103 journalist jack c ferguson hurried down beacon hill past the courthouse and into scollay square where the lunchtime crowd was gathering lunch in scollay square two drinks in the domino lounge watching shirl the twirl and her tassels
2719104 some called it a chicken coop a mayan cistern or disneyland east but to mayor kevin whites aide colin diver the new city hall was a symbol of the bold imaginative boston they were trying to build as its base was rooted in the red brick of old boston so the upper reaches soared in shafts of gray precast concrete
2719105 to private investigator carlotta carlyle it looked like a huge hole in the ground a gaping horizontal wound bridged by decking stuffed with scaffolding trucks and mysterious machinery one guy was pushing a broom around the hard packed earth at the bottom of the massive trench the rest were milling aimlessly sitting on piles of iron bars at union wages they were an expensive bunch of bench warmers
2719106 my own first ride on a swan boat occurred at the age of three and is chiefly memorable for the fact that one of the live swans paddling around us bit my mothers finger when she offered it a peanut i remember the hole in the black kid glove and a drop of blood
2719107 just as they were getting ready to start on their way a strange enormous bird came by it was pushing a boat full of people and there was a man sitting on its back good morning quacked mr mallard being polite the big bird was too proud to answer
2719108 phyllis insisted they take a cab to the ritz alicia would have preferred to walk but didnt say so
2719109 it makes me think money doesnt have to be a problem
2719110 the back bay had been building for thirty years and more now and at last it had begun to look the way it was intended to look like the long elegant boulevards of baron hausmanns paris in that age of restless ruthless individualism every architect here bent his ego to the demands of the entire streetscape it would have been thought bad manners to attempt a design that did not fit
2719111 spenser could hear no conversation among the pursuit but they didnt need to talk we were at the verge of the harbor where the charles emptied into the atlantic through a series of locks the wet air was strong with the smell of the salt sea and the faint echo y sense of moving water
2719112 i dont know where you want me to go the kid said
2719113 curb salesmen shouted their wares their piled up produce blocking the sidewalks along with retail buyers inspecting the open crates faneuil hall was a droning hive in and out of which darted agile jobbers to inform the busy sellers at their rented stalls of merchandise en route by train or boat from every corner of the country and the farthest reaches of the earth
2719114 we had seen the best of it anyway visiting boston in the 1880s from south dakota we had tasted the ocean and found it really salt and listened to the sailors with bearded lips on the wharves where the ships rocked idly on the tide the tide yes that most inexplicable wonder we had watched it come in at the charles river bridge mysterious as the winds
2719115 we had all set our hearts upon getting up to town before night and going ashore but the tide was beginning to run strong against us and the pilot gave orders to cock bill the anchor and overhaul the chain in half an hour more we were lying snugly with all sails furled in boston harbor our long voyage ended
2719116 the trouble i want to tell you about began in 1968 when i was twelve
2719117 we play heavy metal because our lives are heavy metal
2719118 im nice friendly even but i am a maniac who simply enjoys the fruits of acting normal
2719119 we think alpina is a really exciting line and were proud to have it in our store
2719120 we oppose any attempts by military elements to change governments through extra constitutional means
2719121 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2719122 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2719123 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2719124 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2719125 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2719126 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the backstroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2719127 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2719128 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back
2719129 i think were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting to get that
2719130 i felt great i felt like i had more energy so im really psyched about my 50
2719131 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would

2719140 i felt great i felt like i had more energy so im really psyched about my 50
2719141 making it worse at least for this particular die hard fan of pantera was the uninspired tributes to dimebag darrell shot on stage during a concert in 2004 darrell has become a martyr for metal as the universally loved and unbelievably talented guitarist was taken way before his time his tributes however were disappointing other than a standout performance by the cavalera conspiracy as well as some great footage of dimebag scrolled over the big screens the attempt was not a good one an acoustic performance of pink floyd s wish you were here that sounded slightly out of tune was the topper
2719142 you are probably not that good a rapper maybe you are the next lil wayne but probably not in which case you need to stay in school

2719144 himbauan salah satu pemimpin partai politik yang menyatakan bahwa kadernya yang korupsi jangan ikut ikutan mendaftarkan diri menjadi calon anggota dpr padahal yang seharusnya pemimpin partai yang partainya anti korupsi seharusnya menyatakan bahwa kadernya yang koruptor akan di pecat dari keanggotaan partai dan diajukan kepengadilan untuk mempertanggung jawaban perbuatannya
2719145 with exposure to an environment that has poor quality air pollutants may trigger symptoms of asthma in a dose dependent manner
2719146 with the high minute ventilation amount of air breathed in one minute seen during exercise the effects of exposure to these pollutants are more noticeable in athletes than in non athletes and likely more evident in people with asthma than in those without asthma
2719147 however a significant percentage of the pollution about 35 at the olympic stadium can be attributed to sources outside beijing controlling only local sources of pollution may not be sufficient to achieve the air quality goal set for the beijing games
2719148 clade c vaccine products certainly warrant further investigation in light of several recent publications regarding potentially novel properties of the c envelope and because more than half of the global hiv 1 infections are clade c
2719149 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
2719150 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments

2719157 the first game of an olympics is always the most difficult
2719158 but pau gasol is improving so the expectation is high
2719159 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2719160 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2719161 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2719162 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2719163 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2719164 we had a deal i told bob that i wanted this to be my last 400 im he said i have to end on a record
2719165 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2719166 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2719167 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2719168 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for

2719177 its ironic that coke a company that has been a major promoter of weight gain is now pretending that it is coming to the rescue of overweight people
2719178 they should have called this drink fleece since thats what theyre trying to do to consumers plain old tap water has zero calories five calories fewer than enviga but unlike enviga tap water doesnt cost 15 bucks a gallon

2719224 white northerners had a rather complacent and self satisfied attitude that anti black prejudice and anti black violence in particular was largely a southern problem and one of the really shocking things about the well publicized springfield race riot and its association with abraham lincoln was that the north had a race problem
2719225 they clearly wanted to mete out lethal justice there on the spot
2719226 went from one end to the other looting homes damaging homes and ultimately setting them on fire by the time they were through theyd displaced at least 40 families
2719227 largely working class rioters were expressing resentment over visible black success and influence in the community
2719228 from the perspective of many springfield residents who were white justice was not done in the end
2719229 liberals in the north were so outraged by the symbolism of this violence occurring in lincolns hometown that they got together called a series of meetings and announced their intent on lincolns birthday in 1909 to form a new organization whose prime initial goal would be to fight anti black violence

2719236 it was such a blur it happened so fast i cant even slow it down and remember the play i tried to watch the replay because i thought my right leg kind of hyperextended or overextended into him when i watched the replay it looked like my left leg went into him and my right leg was out i really dont know what happened it happened so fast and obviously we banged each other up pretty good
2719237 the growth of the abolition movement was due in part to the similarity between it and other reform movements of the era abolitionists like other reformers were calling for a freeing of the human spirit and the elimination of artificial barriers to self fulfillment abolition turned out to be the most important of all the reforms of the jacksonian era but its success would put the union itself at risk

2719264 there were not many packaged side dishes in the market in 1955

2719270 every time we heard that jingle my father would say you know your grandmother gave a rice recipe to the people who started that company
2719271 to be honest we kind of thought could that possibly be true could this iconic american dish actually be attributed to some recipe my grandmother gave years ago
2719272 we are not sure if pailadzo included mushrooms or pine nuts in her version of this recipe but the following is the way i learned it from mellie in 1965

2719295 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2719296 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2719297 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2719298 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2719299 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2719300 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2719301 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2719302 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2719322 la forza c mancano la ritmica e la velocit massimale per arrivare lanciati allo stacco
2719323 direi soprattutto un anno sfortunato la negativa parentesi invernale dopo un 2007 stressante sotto tutti i punti di vista culminata con il modesto risultato nella indoor di genova ci poteva stare visto che nello stage di los angeles ci eravamo allenati poco sulla tecnica ma poi nei successivi mesi di marzo ed aprile andrew aveva lavorato benissimo in tutte le direzioni purtroppo non ci voleva assolutamente la caduta dalle scale avvenuta nei primi giorni di maggio e le successive complicazioni alla spalla con tutto ci pur condizionato dal dolore sia nelle fasi di rincorsa che nella chiusura del salto il ragazzo aveva fatto uscite agonistiche di atene e di oslo saltando rispettivamente 8 metri e 10 ed 8 metri e 16 cm poi a complicare ulteriormente il tutto arrivato anche linfortunio di annecy
2719324 il problema non lo sprint in quanto tale piuttosto il fatto che andrew quando gareggia nella velocit si fa troppo condizionare sul piano agonistico dagli avversari posizionati nelle corsie al suo fianco finendo per alterare la ritmica di corsa

2719351 the judahites would rather deliver their countrymen into the hands of the enemy and live under that enemys domination than fulfill the mandate yahweh had given them to occupy the land and drive out the enemy

2719402 the bbg is also canceling its agreement to broadcast freely via eutelsat into china this agreement was essential protection for the unique open satellite window and assured 24 7 free broadcasting into china since 2005
2719403 ntdtv is affiliated with the falun gong spiritual movement which is banned in china so this may not be your average news channel but heres the important point ntdtv was not blocked from chinas air space by direct order of the chinese government it was removed by the french satellite that had been carrying it and eutelsats embarrassed european owners first said the satellite had technical problems that was not true details of the maneuvers are complex involving even the repositioning of a voice of america transponder

2719407 in the past trying to use notebook parts in desktops jacked up the price of these systems to make them unattractive financially
2719408 now you can move to a smaller form factor and on top of that you can play the green card because these things use a lot less power and energy
2719409 i think that apple will probably continue to grow share for a while
2719410 you will see much nicer looking pcs and more targeted efforts at creating a better experience for people
2719411 at the same time the onus is on us to go one step above and tell end users that the windows operating system is not as heavy as you might think
2719412 saying we agree with you a mobile platform has a lot of value but if you consider a new form factor you will still see that you need not only a mobile platform but a non mobile one
2719413 give us another year and a half or two years and you might see even better stuff coming down the pike

2719420 congratulations to edinburgh dental institute on starting the first stand alone cdt course in the uk dental technicians i am sure will be encouraged by this initiative i know it has been a source of frustration that until now there hasnt been a course in the uk for them to train as clinical dental technicians we hope this is just the start and other training providers will be encouraged to investigate starting their own cdt courses
2719421 the edinburgh dental institute is pleased to be able to offer the first stand alone clinical dental technician course in the uk the course will contain a mixture of lectures and practical demonstrations and exercises in our excellent facilities at the department of restorative dentistry
2719422 flags of non members of the olympics or paralympics flags or banners larger than 2m x 1m flagpoles any banners slogans fliers brochures or samples
2719423 although we recognise the intention behind the international olympic committees ioc ruling on prohibiting demonstrations or propaganda in any olympic sites venues or areas we strongly disagree that the displaying of flags of non state countries such as scotland england and wales comes into this category
2719424 national flags are very much part of the international process of sporting events so we would be extremely disappointed if people from scotland attending the olympic games and paralympic games were prevented from taking the national flag of scotland known as the saltire into olympic venues to show support for scottish athletes just as we would support the flying of other such flags for example those of england and wales
2719425 successful indeed are the believers those who offer their salaat prayers with all solemnity and full submissiveness and those who turn away from al laghw dirty false evil vain talk falsehood and all that allaah has forbidden and those who pay the zakaat and those who guard their chastity i e private parts from illegal sexual acts except from their wives or the captives and slaves that their right hands possess for then they are free from blame but whoever seeks beyond that then those are the transgressors those who are faithfully true to their amanaat all the duties which allaah has ordained honesty moral responsibility and trusts etc and to their covenants and those who strictly guard their five compulsory congregational salawaat prayers at their fixed stated hours these are indeed the inheritors who shall inherit the firdaus paradise they shall dwell therein forever
2719426 and allaah would never make your faith prayers to be lost i e your prayers offered towards jerusalem
2719427 perform as salaat iqamaat as salaat verily as salaat the prayer prevents from al fahshaa i e great sins of every kind unlawful sexual intercourse etc and al munkar i e disbelief polytheism and every kind of evil wicked deed etc and the remembering praising etc of you by allaah in front of the angels is greater indeed than your remembering praising etc
2719428 and the remembering praising etc of you by allaah in front of the angels is greater indeed than your remembering praising etc

2719446 we have a lot of colleges and universities in pittsburgh
2719447 we might not be coming across a ton of macs right now but were steadily seeing more and we needed to be proactive
2719448 its not like we get a mac and say oh well guess we cant do anything with this one
2719449 we will get into the computer it just might take us longer id like to see us be more efficient about it every time we get a mac we have to go looking for help
2719450 its easier to articulate something if youve actually used it
2719451 if a defense attorney brings a mac computer into court and tells me to go to the my documents folder and i cant do it what does that make me look like as an investigator its important to stay on top of all technology especially if its becoming more popular and mac computers are
2719452 in the past it was about being a proud sponsor of the olympics

2719454 theres no way a traditional 30 second commercial could bring people together in this way

2719465 thats why i need to go see mamma mia every other day i really am obsessed with that movie i could watch it every day and never get tired of it i cant play the soundtrack while im driving because i need to dance when i listen to the songs
2719466 the two judges dont want to be the ones to acquit me and face criticism by a section of the nepalese media who have been after me since four years but i am shocked that on the excuse of reopening the so called passport case they have reopened the bronzich case
2719467 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
2719468 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
2719469 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
2719470 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
2719471 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
2719472 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
2719473 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
2719474 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
2719475 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
2719476 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
2719477 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
2719478 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
2719479 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
2719480 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
2719481 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
2719482 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
2719483 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
2719484 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
2719485 he wanted to arrest the woman right then but when he called his boss he was told to let dcf do its own investigation
2719486 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
2719487 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
2719488 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
2719489 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
2719490 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
2719491 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
2719492 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
2719493 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
2719494 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
2719495 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
2719496 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
2719497 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
2719498 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
2719499 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe

2719579 for past seven years israeli companies have been helping gerogian army to preparer for war against russia through arms deals training of infantry units and security advice
2719580 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
2719581 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
2719582 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
2719583 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
2719584 we are now in a fight against the great russia
2719585 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business

2719607 but as an artist id love to see them reinvented as service companies
2719608 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources
2719609 almost 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year
2719610 nuclear energy avoids on average the emission of more than 2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year
2719611 104 fully licensed nuclear power reactors in the united states though only 103 are now operational
2719612 in france we have nearly no coal we have no oil so clearly nuclear appeared to be the best way
2719613 and 30 years later it appears to be a very smart decision

2719615 at budget time our net public debt was equivalent to 42 per cent of gdp down from 48 per cent a year earlier given those figures it is hard to believe that the international credit rating agencies with which the government is so besotted can have any real concern at our current level of debt

2719635 unirea nu este o formatie mai slaba decat in sezonul trecut este o echipa dificila si incomoda pentru orice adversar e o echipa buna dar eu am mare incredere in jucatorii mei si cred ca vom reusi sa castigam duminica nu va fi usor dar cu o atitudine si cu o mobilizare foarte buna din partea lor si cu o ambitie mult mai mare decat am avut la timisoara sunt convins ca vom reusi sa invingem
2719636 dupa parerea mea unirea urziceni are cel mai incomod joc din liga i alaturi de gloria bistrita intr adevar urmeaza un joc foarte dificil tinand cont si de faptul ca urziceniul a terminat campionatul trecut pe locul cinci si au o echipa buna si un lot valoros trebuie sa uitam esecul din etapa trecuta sa ne concentram pe acest meci si eu sper sa reusim un joc bun si un rezultat bun
2719637 ei au probleme acum dar probleme avem si noi in lotul oricarei echipe sunt jucatori cu probleme unii sunt accidentati sau din alte motive nu sunt in lot sau poate nu sunt in forma foarte buna dar unirea urziceni are jucatori valorosi in lot si nu cred ca e asa o mare problema ca sunt cativa jucatori accidentati atunci de ce este un lot de 22 sau 26 de jucatori acelasi lucru se intampla si la noi avem jucatori accidentati dar daca stam sa plangem ca este unul sau altul accidentat nu rezolvam nimic
2719638 dinamo este un club mare i am vazut jucand pe niste cd uri dar si pe viu in meciul cu mediasul au o echipa buna si nu cred ca se tem de noi o sa facem totul pentru a realiza un rezultat cat mai bun victoria e victorie egalul e egal nu putem spune ca un egal ar echivala cu o victorie pentru noi nu suntem favoriti dar vom incerca sa i surprindem
2719639 nu ne gandim cum vor evolua fotbalistii care au venit de la dinamo in acest meci vor juca fotbalisti care sunt in forma si care merita sa evolueze cred ca jucatorii veniti de la dinamo sunt profesionisti si isi doresc sa dovedeasca faptul ca au valoare in meciul asta ei vor juca pentru otopeni nu le interzic sa fie suporterii clubului de unde au venit aici insa vreau ca in acest meci sa fie cu noi pot conta pe fotbalistii veniti de la dinamo
2719640 va fi un meci greu ca toate meciurile unde joaca dinamo toata lumea se mobilizeaza este un meci pe care trebuie sa l castigam n avem alta varianta am incredere in baietii mei nu o sa fie un meci usor acolo sunt 5 6 jucatori de la dinamo sub forma de imprumut este normal sa joace cu ambitie pe mine ma intereseaza cele trei puncte si apoi sa atingem forma maxima la meciul cu rapid
2719641 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2719642 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2719643 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2719644 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2719645 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2719646 shadow governor in the province is seen by australian authorities as a key figure in providing equipment money and foreign fighters to extremist operations in the region
2719647 this is further evidence of the very good work our special forces are doing in the oruzgan province defence minister joel fitzgibbon said through a spokesman
2719648 the capture of the shadow governor will have an immediate and disruptive effect on the current and future taliban extremist activities in the province
2719649 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province brigadier dawson said in a statement
2719650 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan
2719651 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds improvised explosive devices and authorising their emplacement across the province brigadier dawson said
2719652 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people

2719656 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2719715 when you have people suffering economically they really get much more focused on government spending and taxes
2719716 the bulk of challengers are running because they think government is wasteful inefficient and not focused on creating jobs and job retention
2719717 thats the type of irresponsible spending thats gotten us in the situation were in now
2719718 it supports my contention that we need a change in county government
2719719 hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers so you and i are paying it in increased premiums
2719720 some companies seem to figure no one is watching so they can get away with it
2719721 we feel we made an important investment in keeping these older products alive
2719722 when you are on a fixed income its hard to come up with money for school supplies

2719726 first of all we need to remove 1 000 guys from here within 96 hours after that the rest of the guys
2719727 the unplanned redeployment of georgian forces will have some impact in the near term however as with any change in force structure we will make adjustments to ensure sustainment of coalition operations
2719728 we do not anticipate their departure will result in a significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
2719729 they want to go home as soon as possible and help
2719730 we have the same situation in our home as here though the territory is different we have no desert
2719731 any measure by the european union ahead of the end of talks between iran and the five permanent members of un security councilplus germany group 5 1 will be unacceptable
2719732 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring
2719733 there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency
2719734 especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information
2719735 these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse
2719736 we want to get the word out about the services we provide the community
2719737 this is a great venue it reaches a lot of people in one space
2719738 its a unique way to bring community resources together with families so they can learn whats out in the community
2719739 this is a good place to see everything at one time
2719740 if you dont get information here its probably not available
2719741 it is very important for any society not to carry arms but that needs a free country without occupation
2719742 i saw blood dripping from those vehicles as they passed
2719743 i hereby announce the establishment of an ideological moral ethical and cultural mahdi army the armed faction shall be limited to a very few professionally trained individuals
2719744 the department is not aware of karl rove playing any role in the decision to appoint mr griffin
2719745 not aware of anyone lobbying either inside or outside of the administration for mr griffins appointment
2719746 it will be as much about the cover up as about the firings
2719747 are going to tell a narrative and they have taken their investigation right into the white house
2719748 i knew that then white house political director sara taylor and taylors then deputy scott jennings had expressed interest in promoting mr griffin for appointment to be u s attorney and i assumed because they reported to karl rove that he was interested in that
2719749 in february when i participated in the drafting of that february 23 letter i did not remember then ever having talked directly to mr rove about it i dont remember now ever having talked to mr rove about it im not sure whether mr rove was supportive of mr griffins appointment
2719750 kyle didnt want to traffic in assumptions so he circulated the letter to the white house for confirmation whether what he believed to be true was accurate or not he drafted the letter according to his understanding of the facts and he circulated it beforehand to other people for clearance to assure that it accorded with their understanding of the facts
2719751 chris did not recall karls interest when he reviewed the letter
2719752 we have no record of that letter even leaving the white house counsels office
2719753 im concerned we imply that well pull down griffins nomination should pryor object
2719754 i think we should gum this to death ask the senators to give tim a chance meet with him give him some time in office to see how he performs etc they ultimately say no never and the longer they forestall the better then we can tell them well look for other candidates and otherwise run out the clock all of this should be done in good faith of course
2719755 the only thing really at work here is a repeal of the ags appointment authority there is some risk that well lose that authority but if we dont ever exercise it then whats the point of having it
2719756 im not 100 percent sure that tim was the guy on which to test drive this authority but know that getting him appointed was important to harriet karl etc
2719757 the principals never adopted it and it was never done
2719758 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2719759 i hope you will find the time to tell me why this news story is not reported by your paper
2719760 there was a tendency fair or not to dismiss what you read in the national enquirer
2719761 we run the risk of looking like were totally out of it
2719762 or were just like the rest of them we have no standards
2719763 a man who blasted cher and u2 from his home has had his stereo equipment and music collection destroyed karl wiosna of graig near pontypridd was warned to turn down his music by rhondda cynon taf council after complaints were made he was served with a noise abatement notice which he later admitted breaching as a result his two tape and record decks his radio and his tapes and cds were seized by the council

2719775 well in the you can argue that no one is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year hes shown a keen strategic sense in his ability to run an effective campaign he can clearly inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being a president and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2719776 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2719777 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2719778 i dont care what you do just go do what ever

2719822 aber es gibt noch viel was sie ber die franzosen lernen k nnen
2719823 nach der vereinbarung m sste das land pro jahr selbst einen anteil von mindestens 29 millionen euro f r die betreuung von unter dreij hrigen kindern tragen tats chlich setzt die landesregierung aber nur rund zwei millionen euro ein
2719824 die landesregierung ordnet offenbar alles ihrer finanzpolitischen vorgabe unter bis 2010 einen ausgeglichenen haushalt hinzubekommen aber an dieser stelle darf man einfach nicht sparen den eigenen anspruch und die mit dem bund vereinbarten ziele erreicht man damit jedenfalls nicht
2719825 wir haben den gr ten nachholbedarf aber die cdu fdp landesregierung tut viel zu wenig
2719826 aber allein das kultusministerium hat 2007 in dem bereich kinderbetreuung einen viel gr eren betrag n mlich 8 3 millionen euro eingespart und in der so genannten globalen minderausgabe verbucht
2719827 statt das geld f r krippen und kindertagesst tten komplett auszugeben wurde damit teilweise der haushalt saniert
2719828 shall destroy them that are mighty and the people of the saints he shall also stand up against the prince of princes
2719829 behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and elijah went up in a whirlwind into heaven
2719830 in three days you will know that evil will be defeated by justice
2719831 well barack obama and john mccain have both switched their positions on offshore oil drilling they both used to be against it but now they say they are for it under the right circumstances like if it helps them get elected
2719832 the big presidential debates coming up are we still excited about that barack obama wants to debate about foreign policy and john mccain wants to debate about the big band era
2719833 since congress went on recess oil prices have dropped to 118 a barrel thats like a 30 drop from the record high you know maybe congress should take more vacations huh you ever notice whenever these people leave town things just seem to get better
2719834 actually analysts say a weak economy is causing less energy use resulting in falling oil prices yeah basically the worse the economy the lower the oil prices which means if bush could serve one more term oil would be free
2719835 hey you see john mccain was at the countrys biggest motorcycle rally he was in sturgis south dakota you know where all the harley guys go mccain showed up in a customized rascal scooter
2719836 today the moderators were announced for the upcoming presidential debates good yeah apparently barack obama insisted on someone who asks even handed probing questions while john mccain insisted on someone who will talk into his good ear
2719837 john mccain does not want dick cheney to attend the republican convention because he says hes too unpopular yeah and when asked to comment cheney said i hope the senator reconsiders then he turned into a bat and flew away
2719838 they say john mccain is 71 but people are saying he may be older no one knows for sure because his birth certificate was destroyed when the wagon train was attacked
2719839 china has announced that during the olympics protesters will be allowed to assemble in designated protest areas yeah or as theyre commonly called in china jails
2719840 barack obama has agreed to debate john mccain three times this fall both candidates have conditions obama wants the debates to be held on college campuses mccain wants them to be held before 7 00 p m
2719841 congress went on a five week vacation starting today and boy they deserve it dont they they got so much done this year solved the energy crisis health care social security immigration whew take a break fellows
2719842 you ever notice that congress doesnt even call it a vacation you know what they call it a recess you ever notice the only people that get recess are congress kindergarten and juries those are the only three
2719843 i dont know if you noticed this last week house speaker nancy pelosi turned the lights out on congress while the republicans were talking she killed the microphones and turned the lights off yeah yeah the republicans called this outrageous except of course for senator larry craig who called it romantic
2719844 oh you hear about this here you go paris hiltons mother is very upset because john mccain has put paris in his campaign video shes furious isnt that amazing of all the videos paris hilton has been in this is the one moms upset about
2719845 oh and the mccain campaign has accused barack obama of being elitist and using the race card yeah yeah the obama campaign accused mccain of being old and using the discover card
2719846 yesterday president bush announced there are going to be some big changes in intelligence in the white house yeah hes leaving
2719847 they say barack obama could decide to go with another woman see thats what killed john edwards chances of being vp he decided to go with another woman
2719848 as you know the mccain campaign ran that commercial where theyre comparing barack obama to various hollywood celebrities and as you know if theres one thing the republicans will not stand for its electing some hollywood celebrity to public office except for ronald reagan fred thompson arnold schwarzenegger clint eastwood you know except for those
2719849 in a new report by the center for immigration studies researchers report that the number of illegal immigrants in the u s is down by 11 percent and a lot of them are returning home see thats when you know the economy is bad when illegal immigrants are fleeing to mexico for a better way of life

2719858 we were thrown curve balls we were thrown huge distractions our teammate went down minutes before we walked on the floor we overcame a lot today and i think we did great
2719859 it gave a tiny bit of disturbance at the last moment to re organize things
2719860 i definitely felt like i put a little bit more pressure on myself
2719861 people have been telling me to soak it all in but im trying really hard not to think that its the olympics and look at the olympic rings on the floor
2719862 all four events for her were the normal consistent and aggressive shawn
2719863 what we do with that fire how we channel it is our spirituality
2719864 only one of us could make it over the wall
2719865 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2719866 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2719867 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids
2719868 wake up in london go to sleep on atlanta time still my paint got more candy than your valentine
2719869 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday
2719870 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
2719871 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2719872 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2719873 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2719874 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2719875 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2719876 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2719877 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2719878 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2719879 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shoulda told him im a f in rock star
2719880 im like life aint fair chill baby girl my girl is here
2719881 getting the crowd excited for the second sequel to one of the cornerstones of his lauded catalog of classics rumors of the album began this january when but jays reps denied that the song was new
2719882 i walk into the dressing room and kanyes like lets do a record lets do this im like cmon man but you know i couldnt tell him no its his show that was the idea he wanted to perform a new record
2719883 we spoke about doing an album it just was premature
2719884 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label
2719885 i just worked on ciaras album me and kanye did it again we did another hook like two days ago
2719886 i got two records with t pain that are retarded
2719887 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2719888 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2719889 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2719890 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2719891 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2719892 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2719893 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2719894 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2719895 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2719896 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2719897 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2719898 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2719899 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2719900 i should have known that people would feel that way
2719901 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2719902 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2719903 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2719904 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2719905 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
2719906 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2719907 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2719908 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2719909 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2719910 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2719911 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2719912 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2719913 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2719914 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2719915 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2719916 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2719917 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2719918 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2719919 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2719920 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2719921 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2719922 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2719923 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2719924 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2719925 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2719926 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2719927 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2719928 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2719929 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2719930 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2719931 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2719932 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2719933 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2719934 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign

2719950 in the great metropolis of the young australian nation those young people were a sign of authentic joy sometimes noisy but always peaceful and positive
2719951 despite their large number they did not cause disorder or any damage to have fun they did not need to engage in raucous or violent acts nor rely onalcohol and drugs
2719952 how can one not contrast them to their peers who searching for false escapism consume degrading experiences that sometimes result in tragedy
2719953 in this way the spirit does not rest the heart does not experience joy but in fact ends up being more exhausted and sad than before
2719954 lets pray that in a society which is always moving faster vacations may be days of relax during which we can find moments for prayer and time to find ourselves and others

2719958 that any participation of kenteris and thanou at any further edition of the olympic games shall be subject to a new procedure in front of the ioc
2719959 when thanou handed over her accreditation she was no more an olympic athlete
2719960 we said at the time that we would review the eligibility of thanou for beijing so if the greek olympic committee enters thanou in beijing we will study the eligibility we have the right to do that
