770018 australias free settler heritage is often overlooked in favour of its more colourful convict past
770019 however it should be remembered that free settlers were brave and ambitious making the choice to leave their homes and travel by ship for many months to the other side of the world for the chance of a new life
770020 failed to share in one of the grandest experiences of life
770021 the launch of this online archive is particularly interesting and important considering recent debates in new zealand about the future of rail and the kiwirail ceremony in wellington today
770022 it was the brainchild of prime minister joseph gordon coates who saw it as a way of improving industrial relations within the railways and disseminating useful knowledge to railway workers their families and the public at large
770023 the object of the magazine should be to bring more interest into railway life to expand its possibilities not only for personal profit but for public appreciation to help towards conditions which make for satisfaction in all ranks within the department by reciprocal and mutual service benefiting each other by the improvement of the conditions of service for all
770024 the grey river argus is the first paper available on papers past that covers the entire first world war offering real insight into the lives of new zealanders through the war years
770025 the grey river argus adds to what is already a fantastic source of information about social and political events in new zealand from 1839 to 1920

770030 corsair ii versus focke wulf 190a 4 this would be a contest between a heavyweight and a lightweight fighter with virtually all the advantages on the side of the latter having flown both aircraft a lot i have no doubt as to which one i would rather fly the fw 190a 4 could not be bested by the corsair verdict the fw 190 was arguably the best piston engine fighter of world war ii it is a clear winner in combat with the corsair
770031 the fw 190d 9 preserved all the superb handling characteristics of the earlier versions and in addition had significantly enhanced engine and firepower
770032 i found a noticeable reduction in roll rate and an inrease in stick force per g by comparison with its bmw 801 powerd predecessors some of the more attractive qualities of the original fighter having been sacrificed in order to achieve the best possible performance at extreme altitudes

770069 its like coming up for air one gets the chance to completely fill the lungs before diving back into the practice
770070 this was a really good for us because russia put the ball in the hands of their two best players j r holden and andrey kirilenko and when they do that theyre a really good team and a tough team to defend i thought our defense was excellent and on offense we seemed a little bit out of synch what im really pleased with is it didnt come easy offensively for us and it never had a negative impact on our defense and tome thats a really big thing
770071 theyre a physical team theyre a big team they did a good job on the offensive boards which kept us out of the open court for a little bit but in the second half i thought we did a much better job being the initiators and playing with a bit more energy whether we scored the ball or whether we got a defensive rebound we played with more energy and pushed the ball up the floor
770072 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
770073 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of see sawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
770074 youve got to learn guys tendencies and get used to guys but its pretty easy with this group because they all know how to play the game they all know how to move without the ball and so its pretty easy to find someone out there
770075 tonight i thought chris bosh played a great game chris defense away from the basket is outstanding i think its been one of our strong points
770076 when i look at chris performance a lot of it isnt going to show up in the stats except the fact that they got 68 points and chris bosh had a lot to do with that as a coach you cant just judge this the box score youve got to judge what you see and whats happening out on the court
770077 we have so many talented offensive guys im really not worried about offense i feel i can help this team on defense being active getting my hands on some deflections rebounding the basketball and running the floor
770078 defense is very important to this team because were not going to shoot the ball well every day and we cant let our offense dictate how the game is going to go we have to let our defense dictate that
770079 90 and up is what i am looking for vanny more effort and work harder
770080 since the other system is already working pattern yours to them

770082 though we are not guilty in that because admit it at3 most of us are grade conscious in our college life and studying is our one way of bonding
770083 thanks for being so understanding i am really sorry for what i did i just hope that the trust is still whole and intact after everything as always i enjoyed being with you cause i know i can always count on you love you and see you again
770084 ill just pretend i dont know anything so that it wont bother me so that ill forget about it and you know i cant defy you i will always be here love you too sleep tight and sweet dreams

770094 yes christmas has its roots in ancient pagan festivals the new york times explains pope liberius in the fourth century decided to absorb pagan observances by declaring dec 25 the official birthday of jesus the change of name made little change in form

770097 while the words might change from country to country and are sometimes taken for granted human rights represent one of the universally agreed upon ideas that all people are born with basic rights and freedoms that include life liberty and justice this year marks the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights adopted by the united nations
770098 unless one wants to live a stunningly boring life one ought to be on good terms with ones darker side and ones darker energies
770099 i believe in short that we are equally beholden to heart and mind and that those who have particularly passionate temperaments and questioning minds leave the world a different place for their having been there it is important to value intellect and discipline of course but it is also important to recognize the power of irrationality enthusiasm and vast energy intensity has its costs of course in pain in hastily and poorly reckoned plans in impetuousness but it has its advantages as well

770104 im really pleased for our first time out that we got this win against a very good team
770105 we did know coming in that latvia was going to be a very good opponent having watched them beat russia last night and having seen them play in the olympic qualifier we can play better and we tend to play better as we go but we certainly got all we could handle from latvia
770106 for the most part i think we started the game out with a lot of energy and it kind of died down in the second quarter until halftime
770107 we were just playing sluggish we picked it up finally but i think our defense needs to get much much better we need to keep our energy throughout the whole game
770108 i thought it was a good effort by everybody i think everybody tried to do what was asked of them latvia is a good team they play well together i think we need to be a little more disciplined at times when we start pressing we gamble and maybe we shouldnt we need to make teams earn more of their points through their offense there are ways we can improve but we didnt try to show much on offense we put up enough points and obviously we need to tighten up our defense
770109 first i realized i dont do birthday cards very often so this was particularly a challenge for me and is the first part of the challenge to use a birthday theme next i would like you to use four layers or less i have been thinking about this a lot and i think in the future that when i post a challenge the amount of layers wont matter because i figure we all have paper right for this one though stick to four layers or less the last aspect of this challenge is the toughest you may use ink pads but no other form of ink or coloring this includes markers of any kind crayons colored pencils gel pens blender pens etc if you have a bold image that should not be a problem but if you choose to use a line image you will have to paper piece the colors into your image if you wish to fill it in the beauty of it though is that all of the paper pieced parts only count as one layer thought id make at least part of this a little easier also ribbon cord is the only allowed embellishment i know this may be tough please no cuttlebugging stickles brads eyelets primas nestabilities etc punches are okay but try to limit them i only used them for the sentiment stick with the paper ink and ribbon and of course your stamps have fun
770110 velen zien het als een stereotypering daardoor werkt het tegen de homos die het al lastig vinden om zichzelf te zijn
770111 ik kan me niet voorstellen dat het opkomen voor gelijke rechten een provocatie zou kunnen zijn
770112 ik was er niet al ging die beslissing niet over een nacht ijs wij vinden homo emancipatie erg belangrijk en we ondersteunen alles dat de sociale acceptatie van homos bevordert
770113 maar de gay pride is heel provocerend en eenzijdig de homos die meedoen zijn ook maar een deel van de n miljoen homos die nederland telt ik zou liever iets ondersteunen met meer diversiteit
770114 we zouden gek zijn als we deze kans lieten liggen
770115 geloof en homoseksualiteit gaan prima samen dat willen we laten zien vooral aan jonge gelovigen die nog met hun geaardheid worstelen
770116 we hebben ook mensen met een orthodoxe achtergrond aan boord en zelfs een heilsoldaat
770117 dat is om de kleuren van de regenboogversiering op de boot goed te laten uitkomen
770118 iedereen vaart op zijn eigen manier mee onze boot heeft van tevoren veel gesprek opgeroepen daar was het ons vooral om te doen
770119 de lijst met vragen die werknemers aan pensionados willen stellen is enorm
770120 bovendien vloeien uit ieder gesprek natuurlijk ook weer vragen voort
770121 de managers van mijn coachees hoeven niet te weten dat ze met mij praten maar ik raad wel aan om het te vertellen zo kunnen we effectiever werken en kun je ook onder werktijd bij de coach langs
770122 het is uniek dat wij specifiek op ing gerichte coaching kunnen krijgen het is voor mij veel waard dat grietus ing heel goed kent en zelf een manager was we kunnen in alle vrijheid en openheid praten ook al werken we voor hetzelfde bedrijf
770123 ik doe het vooral uit affiniteit met mijn vroegere werk om het contact te behouden bovendien houdt het me jong ik vind het heel interessant om te zien hoe jonge mensen hun loopbaan inrichten maar ik ben wel benieuwd of ing in de toekomst voor dit project een manier vindt om coaches op een adequate manier te honoreren
770124 bedrijven moeten er van uit gaan dat mensen het niet volhouden om veertig laat staan vijftig jaar hetzelfde werk te doen zij moeten mogelijkheden verzinnen voor een tweede carri re binnen het bedrijf daarbij moet je de idee loslaten dat die loopbaan zich in een hi rarchisch stijgende lijn moet ontwikkelen een nieuwe baan kan er ook een zijn met een betere balans tussen werk en priv of een waarbij je meer zorgtaken op je kunt nemen de visie op carri reperspectief moet veranderen

770130 ik ga in peking zeker een persoonlijk record zwemmen ik zwem in de trainingen mijn beste tijden ooit dat heeft ook wel met het nieuwe pak te maken maar het gevoel en de vorm zijn goed
770131 door de pakken kent het seizoen een rare ontwikkeling maar dat is ook wel de charme van de sport en een olympisch jaar ik vind dat niet erg want ik krijg juist een kick van een nieuwe situatie het heeft me een nieuwe prikkel gegeven vooral in de training

770135 a rush of the public in a very small place
770136 we ask the public not to fall prey to rumors
770137 ik zie het aan mijn hyves pagina twaalfjarige meisjes laten er massaal berichten op achter model is een van de weinige beroepen waarmee je internationaal kunt doorbreken en je hoeft er niet voor naar de toneelschool
770138 schoonheid was vroeger alleen weggelegd voor de elite die geld had voor goede verzorging
770139 de gemiddelde nederlander had in de jaren vijftig rotte tanden maar nu doen moeders hun dochters liposuctieoperaties cadeau voor hun zestiende verjaardag ik noem het de democratisering van de schoonheid programmamakers vullen er hun zakken mee dat begon met die extreme waarin bessie turf werd omgetoverd in een glamourpoes en nu worden gewone meisjes model gemaakt die meisjes zijn assepoester het muiltje is de tv en janice is de boze stiefmoeder
770140 janice gebruikt jongens en meisjes voor haar eigen act door hen af te branden wij wilden meisjes in het programma model in 1 dag juist confronteren met hun pluspunten in plaats van in te zoomen op wat ze niet goed doen en op de ruzies onderling
770141 onze doelgroep is iedere puber dik of dun ik sla interviews met winnaressen van die programmas af omdat ik onze lezeressen niet een schoonheidsideaal wil voorhouden een half jaar geleden hebben we een modereportage met onze lezeressen in ons blad gehad bewust met meisjes die te kort te lang te dun en te dik waren vergeleken met het maatje 36 ideaal van de modellenprogrammas om meiden te laten zien dat je sowieso mooi kunt zijn hoe je ook bent ik vind het vreselijk om te zien hoe die meiden door janice dickinson worden afgekraakt meisjes van twaalf krijgen dat allemaal op hun netvlies ik vind dat redacties daar best eens twee keer over mogen nadenken
770142 ik zie hier in mijn woonplaats new york dat individualiteit veel meer wordt gewaardeerd dan in nederland
770143 er is niet n standaardbeeld en dat zou ook niet in die programmas moeten zitten het model dat wint moet wat mij betreft het meisje zijn dat zich het minst aanpast die iets afwijkends heeft mode maakt het leven mooi maar om de top te bereiken kun je niet de hele dag met je lipstick in de weer zijn je zult toch wat uurtjes in de bibliotheek moeten doorbrengen
770144 tja iemand met kolenschoppen van handen moet ook geen tandarts worden
770145 modellen krijgen kleren niet op maat gemaakt ze moeten dus de doorsnee gangbare maat kunnen showen en het ideaalbeeld van iedereen is nu eenmaal lang en slank
770146 bij het programma coleens real women is de teneur juist dat je van je pretspekjes mag genieten en toch model kunt worden puur natuur komt weer in
770147 nederlandse meisjes zijn vrij nuchter die staan met beide benen op de grond en prikken wel door de glamour heen ook moeten modellen sowieso hun middelbare school afmaken en als ze dan model worden beleven ze vaak een speedcarri re tussen hun zeventiende en eenentwintigste vaak gaan ze daarna studeren in new york parijs of amsterdam er zitten juist heel wat positieve kanten aan de modellenwereld je kunt in een paar jaar tijd bijvoorbeeld uitvoerig rondkijken in een creatieve leuke sector voor een eventuele vervolgcarri re je komt in aanraking met fotografen en artdirectors ach die schadelijke invloed van programmas in de jaren tachtig zeiden ze dat gympen dragen slecht zou zijn voor je voeten zo is er iedere keer wel wat
770148 hoeveel jongens willen er niet profvoetballer worden maar krijgen later een gewone baan het is niet zo erg dat meisjes model willen worden zeker niet als het hen ertoe aanzet om een beetje op hun gewicht te letten overgewicht is een groot probleem in amerika en model zijn is een bijzonder talent er zijn veel meisjes die het vak ambi ren maar slechts weinigen die de top bereiken
770149 we kijken de hele dag naar het uiterlijk van mensen ook al vinden we dat niet cool van onszelf
770150 waarom alleen maar zeggen dat iemand niet lang genoeg is terwijl het gaat om een prachtig persoon
770151 in china moet ivens zich thuis gevoeld hebben omdat hij onder gelovigen was zoals chinese communisten zich bij hem op hun gemak voelden omdat hij vanaf het eerste moment hun kant gekozen had
770152 ja tijd vliegt om h als je plezier hebt jij nog eh plannen voor het weekend
770153 ja ik heb me opgegeven voor de chinese gouwe kooi
770154 ja dan moet je 30 jaar in de gevangenis zitten en als je na 30 jaar nog in de gevangenis zit dan eh ja dan mag je blijven zitten
770155 terwijl hij verduistert verheldert hij ook de panelen zelf zijn op verschillende manieren doorboord gebroken uit elkaar genomen en weer in elkaar gezet achter deze werkwijze schuilt een drang tot herstellen die draait om het reconstrueren van datgene wat gefragmenteerd en uiteengevallen is
770156 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
770157 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
770158 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
770159 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends

770179 whoa you hit a higher note than most kids hit youre a natural you defiantly have an innate ability here
770180 what this is only four tracks how many bounces did you do this sounds like at least twelve layers in there
770181 what really youre going to do what that sounds so cool yeah sure
770182 ok gotta device number heres the button number on or off
770183 this is kind of fun i could be on stage right now i could play in this
770184 yeah oh my gosh it feels like im actually playing it
770185 so this isnt really a real instrument it cant be a good instrument because its not very expressive
770186 well of course were talking about big meaty buttons versus six vibrating strings with your fingertips on them where you can bend them and you can play dynamically on a real guitar of course im not trying to replace the guitar here im just trying to make a new kind of keytar there are over three million of things out there there are more of these in the world than there are actual guitar playing people i think the survey poll was something like 70 percent of all people surveyed that had played guitar hero only about 30 percent had actually ever played a real guitar so its obviously pretty important to recognize that if this could be turned into a playable instrument in some capacity i might be inspiring somebody that was the crux of it expressively there is something that this has that a guitar doesnt have and that is that it has a tilt sensor in there it detects this as well so you can apply that to some sound parameter like changing a filter or effect or something this defiantly ads to the expressiveness it can attain so are you a virtuoso on this by now do you still play regular guitar yeah actually more than ever lately because ive been wanting to get back to recording on actual tape again i want to start recording real guitar again
770187 hey so i took a look at your programming and i see where youre generating certain frequencies and this certain note map how do i save that
770188 ok in this patch its embedded into the file and you can redo it if you want but all the chords are based on that thing and its going to jack all your chords

770204 three orphanages have been visited already and photographs have been sent to her
770205 it is thought we are already down to a shortlist of ten girls aged between six and 18 months
770206 it terrifies me to think that little kids are growing up in a country that is getting more and more violent kids carrying knives is just too awful to think about
770207 but we cant sit around being shocked we all have to do what we can to try to stop it
770208 all i think about is what sort of low self esteem and sense of self worth these kids have if they accept that being killed in this culture of violence is just a fact of their lives
770209 it makes me mad that people keep comparing me to amy winehouse and dusty springfield its just labelling me as something else without any respect for the struggle the determination focus or artistic vision i have
770210 its like whoa whats that about why would i want to be someone else because i really dont i just want to be me

770228 here the hope is in confident expectation of the life to come notice that this hope isnt for the persecutions to end
770229 according to the new testament our lifestyle is influenced both by the new life which has been given to us we have been born of god
770230 we know that everyone who has been born of god does not keep on sinning
770231 if anyone says i love god and hates his brother he is a liar for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love god whom he has not seen
770232 everyone who believes that jesus in the christ has been born of god
770233 for everyone who has been born of god overcomes the world and this is the victory that has overcome the world our faith

770237 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ according to his great mercy he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
770238 this man came to jesus by night and said to him
770239 truly truly i say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
770240 how can a man be born again when is is old can he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born
770241 truly truly i say to you unless one is forn of water and spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
770242 yeah she is she had heels on but she was still
770243 financially it works out better not having a minor league team because the facility is too big
770244 having an nba or nhl team is not even an issue with those 40 plus nights a year that a team would be there it would actually hurt our ability to schedule other events
770245 these acts would have gone to st louis or omaha just a couple years ago
770246 a user has reported that the plugin only works with the jira enterprise edition
770247 why not enjoy myself most other people appear to be enjoying themselves am i too good for this or something
770248 whats surprising is to date the issue hasnt even been on the agenda but i dont think itll stay that way for long
770249 if you think about all the services states provide hospitals schools for example they consume a lot of electricity they consume a lot of goods and services and also just their wages bill is set to rise because of the small inflationary effect
770250 as with households and as with some businesses theres a very strong case for compensation here
770251 as with so many other disputes between the states and the commonwealth theyve got coag and other processes for figuring this out but its no different from a stoush between the sates and commonwealth over health funding and education
770252 i think the fact that labors decided not to stand a candidate means its a more open contest than it might have otherwise been
770253 it gives an opportunity for an independent or a minor party to come through
770254 i think at the end of the day though the liberals probably should be confident theyll still hold mayo
770255 with the by election we know that the governments not going to change hands so at the end of this mayo election kevin rudd will still be prime minister so it means the voters of mayo can perhaps bring some other considerations to bear
770256 the old 10 trip saver was only available for people in the brisbane city council area
770257 this new discount is for everybody right across the south east corner so its a great incentive to get people to look at using a go card and id encourage them to find out more about it today
770258 what that means for example for someone travelling from nambour into the city their fare will reduce from 9 80 to 6 30 its a 20 to 35 per cent discount depending on where youre travelling so get a go card today
770259 theres no doubt in my mind that for the last six months the government has been focussed on trying to fix all the mistakes in the go card
770260 while theyve been putting all their resources to that they havent been able to introduce a much more effective fare system
770261 were now only starting to see a better system brought into place
770262 for six months now commuters have been putting up with a very inflexible fare structure that hasnt offered the same discounts as paper tickets
770263 with the council of australian governments on the murray it was really about how do we now claw back and make amends for decisions that have been made in the north
770264 out of the corner of my eye i saw he was on top of the counter
770265 i looked up and there he was with a knife in his hand he jumped down pouncing me with his knife
770266 i turned around and went to the cash drawer and told him he could take all of the money he didnt have to do anything else

770276 we will be talking to the minister about the appropriate amount of volume that will be able to be extracted there
770277 the business community is already doing an awful lot in areas like western australia and the northern territory and queensland
770278 i think this comes at a very important time and a very good time
770279 we are short of people we are short of skills so there is not a better time to take this initiative
770280 the key to economic progression is to get economies going within the communities and real jobs will lead to real economic gains which can be shared throughout the communities so it is an excellent idea
770281 i would hope that we would be incorporated in the plan
770282 its obvious that the working group has already been set up but we havent been contacted which i find interesting as we are the only provider of tertiary education to indigenous people so well wait and see
770283 you probably are looking at millions but you would obviously develop a plan
770284 theyll be at my office this week and i look forward to having my staff greet them with a cup of tea
770285 my guess is many of the students wont be there for the afternoon and what impact will that have on their attendance records
770286 we would hope to see a resolution to the dispute sooner rather than later but if we need to take this matter right up to the next state election then thats what will happen
770287 i dont believe that there will be industrial action right up until the next election and we will resolve these issues and the best way of doing that is ensuring that we continue to negotiate and we continue to talk and we do so in good faith

770428 with the grandstand concerts our goal every year is that people hopefully will find something that appeals to them in the lineup
770429 we maybe didnt get every type of music we went after but its still pretty diverse and were real pleased with what we were able to book and weve already gotten some great feedback
770430 every year also we have an incredible lineup of talent on our free stage and some of those artists rascal flatts kenny chesney and many others have gone on to play our grandstand and beyond
770431 ive never played up at the state fair before so i really dont know what its going to be like to play but were looking forward to it
770432 were going to play irish music but also fiddle music from monroe and brown counties i think indiana music seems appropriate for the indiana state fair
770433 as a former sports guy i certainly was aware that having romo around could maybe have a little pr value
770434 its not like that sort of thing doesnt happen we did a kid rock show in 2001 and happened to hit that three month or so window when he and pamela anderson were together and she came to his show here but i dont expect to see tony romo

770445 back then we were having discussions with guys on the transition from cassettes to cds
770446 now were holding the same discussions behind closed doors almost about the internet and the digital domain on our business
770447 again it was a behind closed doors summit with 15 people in the music business and the ceo of napster and some other people phil ramone jimmy jam representatives from most of the labels and a guy in a black suit from the government to talk about it
770448 hip hop and urban music were the first to really get onboard with the use of technology mp3s ringtones
770449 almost exactly a year ago i was in some meetings where distributors were planning within five years and not speculating but planning to be out of the cd business
770450 it felt like within five years we would be in a purely internet download world and a lot of major companies were shifting their networks to prepare for that download world and getting into the download business and now in the last couple of months ive started to hear some backpedaling on that
770451 it may be cds are a format that may last longer than first speculated im not sure where that slowdown came from because it seemed like a year ago everybody was all prepared it was full steam ahead cds were obsolete and obviously the sam goodys and the ma and pa distributors of the world were going out of business right and left but now for some reason youre hearing that best buy and wal mart have said maybe there is some longevity to the cd format
770452 if the automotive industry were to make a commitment to a certain apparatus remember for a while during the transition between cassettes and cds we had both in our cars
770453 there are so many different avenues of exposure now that i think were gonna have to get our hands around that
770454 its somewhat free form now when a cell phone can grab and run streaming video or send it to youtube and other places
770455 for the first time last year we sat down and made a concentrated effort its like ok myspace is real ok youtube is real internets real from our own website we have a company echo that takes care of that part of our world but yeah were in
770456 its akin to the great land rush you know people are trying to stake their property and the wars on
770457 nigerian listeners are very sophisticated and they dont want any trash an album has to be really world standard before they will put out their money to buy it so you have to do your best work in the best studio
770458 dearest adele i have a feeling well be moving out soon so i may not get a chance to write for some time thank you for all your letters i cant tell you how much they cheer me and make me think of home im not trying to frighten you im going into this having accepted that i may not be back if that should happen promise you will not mourn my passing move on live your life to the fullest in order to give mine meaning and to honor the cause were fighting to achieve when bullies rise up we have to beat them down whatever the cost thats a simple idea i suppose but one worth giving everything for the only thought that saddens me aside from failing at our task is the thought of never seeing you not holding you not seeing our children grow not spending the passing years with you if i should not come back know that i will never truly leave you should you be walking years from now on a spring day and feel a warm breeze graze your cheek that warm breeze will be me giving you a kiss remember finally above all that i love you

770460 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
770461 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

770467 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen

770493 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
770494 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
770495 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
770496 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
770497 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids

770593 even if this bill becomes a law in the united states it will have a very big impact on creators around the world on creators like you and me this bill when passed into law will not make any difference between the works created by an american citizen and the works created by anyone else in the world the implication is that every work from everyone in the world would have to be registered in the usa
770594 this proposed law violates the international berne treaty and the trip negotiations agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property trips unesco it may be susceptible to an international lawsuit under international treaties
770595 congress is considering a major reform of copyright law intended to solve the problem of
770596 precisely what must be done by either the infringer or the copyright owner seeking to avoid infringement is not specified upfront the bill instead would have us rely on a class of copyright experts who would advise or be employed by libraries these experts would encourage copyright infringement by assuring that the costs of infringement are not too great
770597 the bill makes no distinction between old and new works or between foreign and domestic works all work whether old or new whether created in america or ukraine is governed by the same slippery standard
770598 in a digital age knowing the law should be simple and cheap congress should be pushing for rules that encourage clarity not more work for copyright experts
770599 we are now looking at this as a damage limitation exercise and we are looking at it with some concern
770600 before the bill orphan works in the us were largely thought of as an issue only affecting museums and large archives this proposal would affect all artists as any work from dusty old prints to high end advertising campaigns could become orphan works when we moved into the digital era we became victims of an inadequacy of technology there are no mechanisms in place to make sure that author information could be permanently fixed to the file now as a result there are naked files all over the place
770601 diligent search with that aim in mind would not be difficult
770602 authors owners today feel free to release those works without attribution knowing that they will retain their full rights
770603 they will be able to pop out sue and collect heavy damages from an unsuspecting user who couldnt find them to ask for permission

770632 this can be accomplished without giving advertisers and merchandisers free reign to commercially use photographs
770633 if the infringer and the photographer disagree on what is reasonable compensation the photographer will have to file suit to pursue higher payment
770634 but the photographer will not have the potential benefit of having costs and attorneys fees paid if the court determines that the orphan works defense has been established under the current law courts can award costs and attorneys fees based on variety of factors
770635 each bills mandate for a study on remedies for small copyright claims wont help photographers with these problems in the interim
770636 taking an extreme position can lead to congress saying we are never going to make you happy so we are not even going to listen to you
770637 companies that fail to negotiate compensation in good faith and within a realistic timeframe can lose the orphan works defense

770665 the solution proposed by the copyright office to the problem of museums and libraries use of archival materials is too far reaching and has too many unintended consequences it would make it impossible for photographers to get a fair return if an image is orphaned
770666 we urge the user community and the house subcommittee to work with us to amend the proposal to maintain effective copyright protection for creators
770667 the entire stock photography industry depends on a robust copyright licensing and enforcement regime loosen the restrictions and unauthorized use will skyrocket
770668 for artists this legislation would be a major revision of copyright law
770669 the proposed legislation allows the user of an image to declare it an
770670 this proposal is a disaster for visual creators it is heavily slanted in favor of users if this statute is enacted as it we can pretty much kiss our careers goodbye
770671 in my opinion if that language is enacted in its current form it will be the worst thing that has happened to independent photographers and other independent visual artists since work made for hire contracts
770672 proposals in the orphan works report would make it easier for people to use your images without your permission and make it harder for you to collect the money youre owed when they do
770673 while well intentioned the copyright offices proposal would strip thousands of photographers and other visual artists of their rights unless major modifications are made legislation based on this proposal would disastrous
770674 while this proposal could cause serious problems and financial loss for creators of all kinds of original works it could be especially devastating for commercial photographers and illustrators whose work is often published without attribution
770675 given the infrequent use of photo credits beyond the editorial print world advertising corporate publications and much of the internet make use of photographs sans credit photographers face the very real threat of having their published photographs eventually counted as orphan works

770764 online piracy thrives not only because of the widespread availability of free top tier entertainment but because the venues themselves are now well known well liked and habitually used
770765 even when the price approaches zero all other things being equal people are more likely to act habitually than to break their habit in a digital arena consumers go to venues where they feel comfortable
770766 i suppose there is a degree of brand loyalty to these networks people obviously get familiar with using certain services and certain websites and thats part of the problem
770767 but its not true to say that the internet is uncontrollable the difficulty is that until now nothing has been done about the problem we need to better communicate why its important to support the artists

770772 about the moon long ago back before the empire way before even the first explorers from the old forongorn confederation launched themselves into space on top of primitive rockets it says that the sun never used to set and that the day lasted forever back then there was no sickness and no one ever died of old age
770773 the light from the sun bathed jurrika in an endless noon there were things though that shunned the light despised it some say they were creatures that lived deep underground other tales say they were demons from beyond the sky and that they lived far beyond the suns rays whatever the truth they attacked jurrika bringing death and destruction the sun god and the world spirit fought the darkness and drove it back but the damage had already been done weakened the sun couldnt remain in the sky all the time anymore it had to rest you know to recover its energy this was how the first night came about because of this
770774 en tro pe or something entered the world and along with it came illness and ageing without the sun in the sky the world was vulnerable to attack by the darkness during the night so to protect the life of the world the sun and jurrika used a portion of their essences to create a daughter this daughter seastyl would guard jurrika during the night hours defending it against the darkness according to the old legend thats where the moon came from
770775 my grandpa told me when i was little but its a load of crap isnt it we know the moon is a planetoid captured by jurrikas gravity during the early formation of the solar system we have a night cos the planet is round and turns on its axis as it orbits the sun seastyl is not a goddess but a lifeless hunk of rock scarred by aeons of meteor impacts science robs all the magic from the universe
770776 without science we wouldnt be sitting here right now before science other planets were just pinpricks of light wandering through the night sky when the first telescopes came along for the first time anyone could look and see the beauty of another world not just mages and clerics using magic as they got better we could see them in greater detail and we could see even further out into space some of those pinpricks became huge nebulas splashes of colour light years across paint on the canvas of the gods if you will eventually we were able to leave the confines of our own worlds and look down on them from above for the first explorers this was a humbling experience it is true science does take away some of the magic but it adds so much of its own without it we would only be able to appreciate a fraction of the gods design magic and faith tell us who created the universe science tells us how to appreciate it

770786 turns out he was setting me up though either way he wanted me gone looks like hes finally had enough of me
770787 yeah well thats the past unless i can convince your friends i aint got much of a future have i cept maybe getting shoved through the airlock without a suit
770788 im only a talent but i was able to scan him while i was in the room with him
770789 i couldnt go too deep otherwise he would have noticed what i did get was that he didnt know anything about the attempt on l ks life and he was telling the truth about only being there to steal the jumpcraft
770790 the question now then is what do we do with him
770791 i always knew you had the killer instinct inside of you turns youre just like your old man after all
770792 more questions im exhausted cant we just skip to the airlock and get it over and done with
770793 kid what is it with you and that airlock you got a death wish or something
770794 youre gonna hand me over to the cops arent you
770795 you may not have knowingly been a part of the attempt on lord korodos life but you are partially responsible for duncans death that makes you an accessory
770796 but for some reason an ispd agent wants you dead handing you over to the police now would be giving you a death sentence i sent enough young men and boys to their deaths when i served in the legions its not something i want to make a habit of in civilian life
770797 my face recently got up close and personal with the fists of someone with those same markings
770798 nothing cept stonebreakers are a pretty honourable lot when they give their word you can count on em meaning it
770799 someones tied up the all the servers processing power this ships got a state of the art system that shouldnt be possible
770800 unless someone was hacking the system in order to shut down main power
770801 tear the ship apart if you have to but find that boy oh and brak i want the little brat alive
770802 why does my life have to be so interesting did i offend you somehow in a previous life or do you just enjoy tormenting me
770803 etc por tan s lo dar algunas ideas ya que como suele suceder cuando hablamos de nuevas plataformas nuestra imaginaci n se queda corta a la hora de visualizar el potencial de esta tecnolog a
770804 i never expected so many people to read this blog frankly i still write as if im speaking to a much smaller audience than is apparently the case
770805 due to conditions in the credit markets and changes in the companys retail strategy
770806 the liquidity provided by these facilities will enable us to support our dealers and their retail customers
770807 its the first time in the history of this epidemic that on a large scale we have results
770808 we are entering into a new phase with new challenges challenges of sustainability
770809 dealing with aids now will require a long term response
770810 we are very worried about the wrong idea that we should stop fueling funds for hiv aids
770811 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health
770812 we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
770813 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight
770814 flattered by the attention to my work brought by this russian state prize

770816 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
770817 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
770818 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
770819 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
770820 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
770821 but the second thing we have 7 000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
770822 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
770823 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny
770824 we had full written approval from canberra to import the savannahs now action is going to be taken against us when we have done everything right
770825 we were praised by the government for implementing contracts like ours
770826 our pet only contract meant that no one could buy our cats unless they were de sexed
770827 its open and shut as far as the lawyers are concerned

770836 the law is clear texas is bound not by the world court but by the u s supreme court which reviewed this matter and determined that this convicted murderers execution shall proceed
770837 the united states word should not be so carelessly broken nor its standing in the international community so needlessly compromised
770838 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise u s interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling
770839 im where im at because i made an adolescent choice

770926 in the last three years it had almost become a habit to tell our business partners that well just take the next flight and come over for a meeting that is not really the case anymore
770927 earlier we used to fly in people for interviews not anymore we use a lot more of video conferencing now
770928 members from various other states including fahim and naved from maharashtra also attended the camp
770929 we are concentrating on the three members from gujarat and the two from maharashtra in the investigation their whereabouts are not yet known
770930 under stock lending and borrowing one can take only an eight day view of which the delivery will need 2 3 days this means effectively you have only five days to make money by short selling this is too short a time for anything to change there is an option of rolling over but the chances of rolling over are dim
770931 in f amp o one has a period of one to three month to take positions and it is also cheaper compared to the stock lending methodology why would anyone borrow to short
770932 when you can short through f amp os wholl use the stock lending and borrowing mechanism
770933 when it comes to the mid caps the f amp o route to short is not possible

770937 both m amp m and renault are disappointed with the performance of the segment in which logan sells
770938 we have the alliance with international truck and engine corp for trucks and buses so couldnt get into an lcv alliance with renault then we are not interested in small low cost cars where renault and sister company nissan have partnered with bajaj auto so there again there was no question of an alliance
770939 im taking a lot of confidence from this win you expect to get that after winning your first big tournament
770940 its different when you play against an opponent who plays a similar game with you
770941 he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm today
770942 i had a great match last night i played rocket tennis but that was not possible against andy today weve known each other since we were 13 or 14
770943 we used to watch these kind of matches on television and now we are playing them
770944 it was really hot but ive played all of my matches in these conditions
770945 but by the end we were both tired it was really getting to us
770946 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
770947 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
770948 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
770949 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
770950 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
770951 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
770952 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
770953 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
770954 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
770955 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
770956 because the private health sector is going to be quite happy to provide further services for people who can pay but what about the four million who cant
770957 its so easy to make it work why cant you just make it work
770958 we have grown at this pace by leveraging on the huge distribution network of sbi
770959 while the growth has been robust this may not happen every quarter the growth may even out over the second or third quarter
770960 our share of unit linked plans have come down compared to a few months back earlier the non ulip basked was 25 30 which has increased to 45 at present

770966 national night out gives residents an opportunity to come together and make the statement against crime in the city of santa clarita
770967 as we continue to rebuild new orleans i have made it a priority to create a city that is healthier in every way
770968 by using e10 rather than traditional unleaded gasoline we are creating a more sustainable city and using current technology to improve the quality of life now and for the future
770969 the conversion from traditional unleaded gasoline to e10 will be seamless
770970 the fuel can be used without problem in all city vehicles in addition to the environmental impact the ethanol in e10 unleaded also adds two to three points of octane to ordinary gasoline helping improve engine performance
770971 and we enjoy the opportunity not to put gas in your tank
770972 lets face it were choosing a route thats as environmentally friendly as can be
770973 carpooling is great but this is as clean as you can get

770976 it really felt like wed come full circle that we could think of someone else
770977 the trip was as therapeutic for us as it was for them
770978 it was moving almost spiritual to see folks who had gone through a very similar set of circumstances reach out to us in our time of need
770979 what we went through was minor compared to what you went through
770980 but the nurses from jefferson parish understood what it means to rise to an occasion like this
770981 were here to tell you today that every citizen in the city of new orleans can have comfort that all drinking water passed all testing that was done
770982 its actually forcing the oil to bank itself we have a lot less oil downriver
770983 no indication that the contamination from the oil spill has passed through
770984 the water quality is superior its safe and we hope you enjoy it
770985 any offense against the united states any state or municipality
770986 a lot of people say why dont you just put a boom across the whole river cant happen
770987 the greatest hazard is when its out free floating on the river
770988 thats why you get low numbers at first on recovery
770989 certainly lawyer advertising is allowed but what the supreme court has said is that while its allowed its allowed with restrictions just as free speech is
770990 re enactment of any events of scenes of pictures that are not actual or authentic
770991 while i and every other attorney would agree that commercials cant be false deceptive and misleading the difficulty comes in that you cant regulate the style of ads that gets into a matter of taste a very subjective issue
770992 the issue ive always come up against is balancing the image that lawyers have of themselves and the legal profession against the consumer i do what i think the consumer wants and needs
770993 obviously healthy people jumping up and down and waving a check
770994 the public needs to know that the only way you get large sums of money in a personal injury lawsuit is because you were severely injured
770995 for individual lawyers to tailor their ad campaigns in ways they believe are advantageous to their marketability
770996 a major addition to the advertising standards is one that will require lawyers to have their pitches approved by a louisiana state bar association committee or face possible disciplinary action
770997 im ok with censoring a bunch of lying lawyers anyway makes all lawyers look like fools even though most of them arent ambulance chasers
770998 if you dont know the law you need to call i cant remember his name

771002 by the time they mobilize the equipment and get that on scene im thinking it will probably be sometime next week when youll actually see salvage rigs that connect to the barge itself
771003 its important to industry its important to the public its important to everyone to get that vessel out of there as quickly as possible so we will be working very hard and fast
771004 these are heavy hydrocarbons that can cause water to smell and taste bad but they are not extremely toxic compounds
771005 i would certainly not want them in there to inhale or drink but their toxicity is at a very low level
771006 the mayors saying drink the water in moderation so does that mean im going to get moderately sick
771007 but ill probably wait a few days before i let my grandchildren drink it
771008 so far our results have not shown any areas of concern
771009 we had a couple of very very fleeting spikes yesterday but absolutely no reports of anything above background today
771010 post the test results and i will know whether to drink the water

771015 too many fathers are m i a too many fathers are awol missing from too many lives and too many homes they have abandoned their responsibilities acting like boys instead of men and the foundations of our families are weaker because of it
771016 we need families to raise our children we need fathers to recognize that responsibility doesnt just end at conception that doesnt just make you a father what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child any fool can have a child that doesnt make you a father its the courage to raise a child that makes you a father
771017 i know the toll it took on me not having a father in the house the hole in your heart when you dont have a male figure in the home who can guide you and lead you so i resolved many years ago that it was my obligation to break the cycle that if i could be anything in life i would be a good father to my children
771018 information doesnt want to be the pathetic fallacy in action but it does seem to have a life of its own reflected in the above words because of our seeming obsession with it

771133 if the offer was valuable and justified the level of personal information didnt matter firms were no better off for throwing all of your personal information at you
771134 i think the big takeaway from this research is that personalization might not matter and it may actually hurt

771180 everyone was nice and respectful it didnt turn into a fighting or shouting match nobody put on boxing gloves in that respect it went really well we definitely appreciate roger coming out and sharing the information that he had as limited as it was
771181 not a lot we got a taste of what some of the things theyre going to do on a marketing point of view a promotional point of view we got an idea of how theyre going to look at private teams how theyre going to view us
771182 as far as really solid information that i can take to sponsors or build upon for next year there really wasnt a lot there
771183 but it wasnt a waste of time because the unknown breeds fear and discontent and open communication between the teams the participants and the sanctioning body is a good thing any time you can get them to sit down and talk to you and explain whats going on it calms people down and contains fear and allows people to be more productive so i think thats a good thing
771184 there wasnt a lot of solid information given because i dont think a lot of solid information exists
771185 he said we will get you guys the information that we know you need as soon as we have it and that were working real hard to get it all done but we dont have it all done now we have a lot of stuff were working on he seemed to imply when stuff gets done itll come like opening a floodgate a whole lot of information at once as of right now its not there and to be fair to them they didnt call this meeting they werent ready to have this meeting we did
771186 it was good to get from rogers mouth the vision that they have for what the future is for the sport
771187 its good to hear from the source instead of reading it its good to be able to ask a follow up question on a subject so i think that type of open forum is good for all of us who have our livelihoods invested in the sport its encouraging to know there is a plan that there is a back up plan and over the next couple of weeks well have where were going and what were doing it was just confidence inspiring for the privateer teams to have that open communication with the new organization
771188 were supposed to have answers in the next week or two weeks on the factory superbike class on the schedule they said dont expect a lot of changes
771189 i think with everything there will be details coming out but its hard to have information right now
771190 theyre werent a lot of details but theres enough of an open and candid conversation to give us a really good idea of where its going and a time frame in which its going to happen
771191 i think it was a good thing it was a very open conversation i think the meeting was very beneficial and it was definitely time for it given the confusion of whats been happening lately and all the rumormills it was perfect timing
771192 hes going to go to the five manufacturers are you in or are you out for factory superbike yess go in the yes column the nos and the i dont knows go in the no column and at the end of the day if the ayes a majority have it then well have factory superbike if the answer is no then theres another direction we wont have factory superbikes so for a team like ours it gives us very specific direction ok we dont have to worry about factory superbike were going production racing well run 1000s and 600s and here we go pretty straight forward straight to the point it makes it pretty simple looking at the 600 class and the superstock american superbike class makes it pretty simple for us it will be really easy for us to go racing under that scenario easy for us to create our budgets for next year and know where were at financially before we even get to september if thats going to be the case
771193 theres a really good outcome the road getting there is going to be really long its going to be a lot of work for everybody
771194 in terms of points today has been one of our best race days recently and im happy about that i had some tyre problems in race one and that prevented me from pushing harder we are using some new front forks and they are better for braking and entering the turns but we need more time to evaluate them and understand how we can get better grip i was more aggressive in race two and pushed harder but i lost contact with the leaders after about five laps and then it was difficult to get back into contact all in all though im happier this weekend
771195 race one wasnt so good because i guess we used a tyre that was too soft and it was spinning a lot and not giving good grip i kept going as best i could and tried to score as many points as possible the second race was much better we used a harder tyre and i was happy to take fourth place and maintain second place in the championship we were unable to try anything in this mornings warm up because of the wet conditions and this is the kind of track where you need to put in a lot of laps to get a good set up once again my team worked very well this weekend and i want to thank them for that
771196 i am very disappointed with how today worked out because i really felt that i could make two very good results i had problems entering the turns in race one and the bike was chattering a bit at the rear end it was bad in some corners and not so bad in others but i adjusted my riding style and tried to work my way round the problem i lost some positions but my lap times were pretty consistent and i was pleased to get fourth in race two i got hit by tom sykes on lap one going into druids his bike caught my brake lever and that locked up the front end and i was forced to go straight into the gravel where i crashed it took a few moments to get the bike upright again and then i got back on it and rejoined the race i was last by a very long way but i decided to keep going and finish the race even though i had no chance of any points i did this because i have many fans in britain and i did not want to disappoint them
771197 i am happy to take a second place in race two because in the first race my rear tyre choice was not so good and i was disappointed with that in the second race i just changed the rear tyre and i had a good feeling with that one i had a good battle with kiyo but he was faster than me in some places then i would catch him up congratulations to kiyo and also my team because they made a good job to allow me to finish second
771198 race two was better than the first race we made some changes to the tyre choice and the bike and they worked well i just could not run the pace of the guys at the front because they just pulled away i had a bit of a battle with bayliss and it took a bit of time for me to get past him but i am content with third im out there trying to win races but podiums will have to do for now
771199 we did not get what we expected in the first race but we did a really good second race as a team with both riders on the podium we made the wrong tyre choice for both riders on the first one so in race two one rider went softer and the other one harder obviously each choice was a good one it was a difficult first race because of the weather delay but we made up for it well in race two well done to everyone in the team
771200 im so happy i cannot really believe it we have been near the top of the leader board in all the sessions this weekend so we knew that we had a good race set up the team worked hard to give me a great bike for both races and finally we have a win no two wins to celebrate it wasnt easy i found it difficult to pass and i made a couple of mistakes in race one i was very nervous for the last few laps but in race two i was able to keep a good pace right to the end
771201 i cannot say that i am happy with the results but i have to be satisfied after the problems we have had this weekend of course brands hatch was a new circuit for me to learn and we found it difficult to find a good setting for the bike i had a problem with the left hander going onto the back of the circuit and this is a corner you must get right to carry speed for the rest of the lap
771202 of course i am disappointed especially because i couldnt move forward from the results in brno we made a change after the first race and my pace was definitely better but after a good start i got blocked in at the first corner and then found it hard to pass laconi and walker however i am looking forward to a little holiday before coming back stronger at donington
771203 this second race was more difficult for me compared to the first one my start was not so good and i lost some positions in the first curves im pretty satisfied with my fourteenth place but im disappointed because i cannot reach a good starting position during the qualifying sessions and its always difficult to begin a race from too far back
771204 we made some improvements to the bike in the second race and we put in some good lap times we were consistent once again and within the points but i wasnt able to improve much on my qualifying position so we have to keep working hard on set up and move up to the next level which i hope we can achieve at donington
771205 every time i went out on the bike i learned more and more and its great to be back on a superbike the bike felt brilliant and i was happy with the race set up in the end my fitness level is good but i need to get into the gym to work on my arm strength as i had to lose weight to ride the supersport
771206 im really satisfied with my result in race 1 which allowed me to finish on the podium for the third time in a row the team have done an excellent work and ive tried to give my best unfortunately in race 2 i did not take the corner in the right way and i ended on the run off area compromising my race when i started again i was the last but one but anyway i powered to a good recovery which has ended in twelfth position
771207 unfortunately im feeling very low riding the bike would have been an high risk im not able now to take a superbike to the limit i hope to make up for the lost race in the next championship round at donington after the holidays
771208 i picked for a front rain tyre since the track was wet and due to the rain fallen before the start i thought that the rain would have kept up to fall but it wasnt so my choice was not the best one and i was not able to follow the pace of the rivals endowed with dry tyres anyhow the gap from the championship leader is still little
771209 i am very happy today i started badly in the early laps but my bike had a really good set up so i could keep lapping in 1m26s laps then i pushed and pushed and finally i got the win
771210 i was feeling quite comfortable for most of the race and everything was working quite well but i havent actually spent much time racing with kiyonari and wasnt sure how it was going to pan out he was very strong on the first split and when he came past i would have been very happy for second but when he did i realized he was in the same trouble as me then i saw max coming so fast and had to push really hard and it became a bit of a dogfight towards the end
771211 im quite satisfied with the result i started good then went backwards as some other riders came through the first laps were very hard then i got into a good rhythm and overtook one by one at the end i couldnt believe i came close to these two guys but there was not enough time to try and take troy or kiyonari but it was a good race
771212 im very happy with this weekend on friday i was in first position in qualifying then yesterday i set a good time in superpole it was the same today with fast lap times and a double win i had a lot of pressure with nori behind me and many times i made a mistake but to win here at brands hatch was fantastic today
771213 im very happy for this result because in the first race the rear tyre was not so good and i was very disappointed in the second race i just changed it and this tyre gave quite a good feeling i make a battle with kiyo but he was faster than me in some places and finally i was not able to catch him but we made a really good race congratulations for kiyo
771214 it was better than the first race when we had a few tyre troubles but we made some changes to the bike which definitely improved it but there was no way i could run the pace of the guys at the front they just pulled away i had a bit of a battle with bayliss and it took me a few laps to get past him but im content with third itll do for now but im looking forward to winning races again
771215 im really satisfied with my day in race 1 i was able to make a good start grabbing position lap by lap and especially expressing my skill until the chequered flag that charges my spirit for the second race where after a good first part i had to slow down due to the tyres wear which forced me to the pits
771216 in race 1 i took the way of the pits due to the front chattering which prevented me to ride as i wished i had to slow down lap by lap and i preferred to go back to the pit lane in race 2 i had the same problems of my team mate and i lost the chance to finish into the points
771217 im quite disappointed to tell the truth as i hoped to do a lot better today by the last few laps of the first race the rear tyre wear was pretty bad and thats why we changed the tyre before race 2 unfortunately that was the wrong choice and there wasnt much i could do after the first few laps i am however happy with podium in race 1 as those 20 points have meant that ive increased my overall lead even though its by just a few points that was a great race this morning and my congratulations go to kiyo who really was fantastic here today

771267 another snag has emerged hindering new tang dynasty tv ntdtv from resuming its broadcast into china recently the broadcasting board of governors bbg which broadcasts voice of america and radio free asia into asia announced that it will soon switch from eutelsat to asiasat as its satellite provider because the bbg now uses the ccp controlled asiasat 3s the chinese regime can interfere with this signal at any time terminating any program it desires bbg originally used the ku band kurtz under band on its w5 broadcast into china allowing even relatively small satellite dishes to receive its signal making it accessible to more viewers on asiasat the bbg uses the c band television channel requiring a much larger satellite dish substantially reducing viewership and making it more easily detectible to chinese internet police
771268 an anomaly which led to the loss of the use of one of the spacecrafts two solar arrays
771269 in recent years due to the chinese regimes interference temptations and machinations bbg moved the signal of voice of america voa and radio free asia rfa from the w5 satellite to the china controlled satellite asiasat 3s at the end of 2007 and has chosen to formally end its contract with eutelsat on july 31 2008 that being the case eutelsat will have a better excuse to stop carrying ntdtvs signal on eutelsats w5
771270 international media should have been told they would not have completely free access to the internet before they arrived to report on the beijing olympics ioc press chief kevan gosper told reuters on thursday
771271 ioc press commission head kevan gosper has apologised for misleading the media by promising journalists that internet access during the beijing olympics would be unfettered
771272 chinese organisers said that the censorship would not hamper journalists in their job of reporting on the games sun weide a bocog official said that the plan had always been to provide sufficient internet access for foreign reporters sites run by the falun gong religious sect remain inaccessible as do most sites with the word tibet in their internet address
771273 a bocog spokesman sun weide said that the authorities would provide sufficient and convenient internet access so that reporting on the olympics would not be affected but he refused to explain what sufficient meant in the governments eyes and he did not disclose which websites would be blocked
771274 jonathan watts president of the foreign correspondents club of china said he was disappointed that beijing had failed to honor its agreement to temporarily remove the firewall that prevented chinese citizens from fully using the internet
771275 obviously if reporters cant access all the sites they want to see they cant do their jobs he said
771276 the cosy deal between two of the worlds most powerful bodies the chinese communist party and the international olympic committee to strip away media freedoms reflects badly on both
771277 when china made its bid for the olympics seven years ago it promised that the foreign media would have complete freedom to report
771278 condemns the international olympic committees acceptance of the fact the chinese authorities are blocking access to certain websites at the olympic games media centre in beijing more than 20 000 foreign journalists are affected the organization also condemns the cynicism of the chinese authorities who have yet again lied and the iocs inability to prevent this situation because of its refusal to speak out for several years

771280 james k glassman the new undersecretary of state for public diplomacy has launched a more aggressive program to counter islamist extremism through a war of ideas mr glassman said he was reluctant to provide details of these efforts because it could cause problems for host governments however one program initiated this month with u s backing young tribal voices involves the production of pashtun radio dramas by students in the tribal areas of pakistan the broadcasts include anti extremist themes and are beamed into the tribal regions currently major al qaeda and taliban redoubts
771281 in the july 31 2008 washington times bill gertz provides an interview with james k glassman undersecretary of state for public diplomacy who is working on programs to push back against violent extremist ideology then mr glassman goes on to praise sayyed imam al sharif aka dr fadl as a credible voice against extremists whatever that means mr glassman fails to mention that al sharif calls for jihad in afghanistan that will lead to the creation of an islamic state with the triumph of the taliban god willing this is the same taliban that the american media are so outraged that pakistans isi is reported to have been supporting but mr glassman is paid by american taxpayers as an american government employee to further promote individuals like al sharif to fight so called extremists and the washington times prints his comments without rebuttal or challenge

771305 canada the united states and other countries with military forces in afghanistan are losing a propaganda battle to a resurgent taliban movement a respected international think tank says taliban militants with their faces covered pose for invited photographers in ghazni province afghanistan earlier this month the brussels based international crisis group icg said the afghan insurgencys military capabilities are often overestimated but a sophisticated multi media propaganda campaign is projecting a taliban movement that is increasingly confident of its ability to exploit opponents weaknesses
771306 though the taliban are understandably not easy to access they provide ready updates on information and operations and their own claims according to the icg the talibans rudimentary website is updated several times a day and the taliban are able to put out their story rapidly though its messages are sometimes contradictory

771320 this issue has immediate ramifications for aged care providers but we need clinicians insurers private and public hospital administrators and policy makers to help deliver next generation solutions
771321 private health providers will happily provide services to those boomers who can pay but will walk away from the majority without the means to cover their ongoing health costs this will put a significant additional pressure on the public purse

771326 back in 2000 the sydney games generated an astonishing amount of traffic to olympics websites and in the last four years the number of net users has almost doubled from around 750 million to 1 4 billion that is going to place a massive strain on the official olympics website and the associated infrastructure and it will be interesting to see how it stands up over the past few months weve seen a number of high profile websites fail including amazon and facebook and just this week when amazons s3 service was offline for several hours because of too much gossiping between servers thats the official explanation honest
771327 internet censorship is nothing new to people logging on in china the government blocks a number of sites it considers sensitive it now appears that thousands of journalists arriving in beijing to cover the olympics will face a similar situation at the olympic main press centre situated next to the main sporting venues websites that are off limits include news sites the bbcs english language website is available but not the chinese language version apparently internet explorer cannot display the webpage other chinese language news websites that have been blocked include radio station voice of america and hong kong newspaper apple daily

771329 chinas communist party regime has put in place a reinvigorated internet censorship program blocking controversial websites for journalists at the beijing olympic games while demanding that hotels implement an intrusive spyware program to monitor guests internet use
771330 this type of censorship would have been unthinkable in athens but china seems to have more formalities said mihai mironica a journalist with protv in romania
771331 the international olympic committee interceded tuesday after journalists complained of chinese censorship and low internet speeds at the main olympic press centre gilbert felli the committees olympic games executive director met with the organisers of the beijing olympic games to discuss the issue said kevin gosper chairman of the committees media commission
771332 ioc press chief kevan gosper said wednesday that the beijing organizing committee of the 2008 olympic games bocog will impose limitations on website access i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related he said

771335 the voice of america has ceased its on air russian language radio broadcasts as of july 26 the broadcasts were stopped despite concerns expressed by u s lawmakers and human rights ngos that freedom of speech remains restricted in russia in an apparent effort to limit negative publicity and possible embarrassment neither voa nor bbg issued any public statements in english prior to taking the programs off the air after more than sixty years of uninterrupted broadcasting a one paragraph announcement on the voa russian language web site posted on july 26 stated that as of next day voa programming in russian will be available only through the internet
771336 the closure of voas russian radio service hasnt been reported widely in the russian language press estonian delfi ee was the first to notice the event delfis report was timely reprinted by famous russian daily izvestia the article is titled somewhat misleadingly the voice of america left russias air instead of its russian programming voas am affiliate in moscow 810 khz now carries english instruction broadcasts sw frequencies used by the voas russian are off for now will they be picked up by r libery russian
771337 so much for the promise to restore the funding of russian broadcasts by the senate appropriations committee on aug 1st the russian service of radio liberty starts to use the transmitter hours of the now gone voa broadcasts in russian mostly on the old frequencies so the shortwave transmissions of radio liberty in russian will not be curtailed but instead even expanded at least for now i would not rule out that it is just temporarily until they can cancel the airtime

771340 on friday at the new america foundation the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy james glassman spoke about americas strategy in the so called war of ideas glassmans speech took on an amused tone when he mentioned that he himself disliked the name war of ideas despite his unofficial title as its commander in chief he insisted that the name has connotations that imply a simple two sided us vs them struggle instead glassman was adamant that the objective is not to get anyone to accept our own ideologies but rather simply to have them reject ideologies that promote unprovoked violence
771341 i nearly fell out of my chair when i heard glassman use the word respect for one of the core principles that should define reciprocal american interaction with people in the middle east and asia because that is such a crucial and largely missing element in this domain it will be important to see if this shift results in changes on the ground the bad news is that major aspects of the us public diplomacy program remain very thin in relevance credibility and efficacy

771490 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction

771546 re great writeup on natasha kai on the post website
771547 hes real versatile and has great speed we talked to him at the combine and he told us he was going to run a 4 3 the next day and he did all the guys tell us that but he went out and did it
771548 staying hungry after the ultimate success is particularly difficult in the fishbowl that is the new york market
771549 well ive known that i can perform and i can play good
771550 i guess im just trying to let that come out in me
771551 you know ive certainly put on a decent show today
771552 theres plenty more in me and i know i can do better
771553 cornerback ellis hobbs labrum groin safety rodney harrison linebackers mike vrabel and bo ruud wide receiver wes welker guard stephen neal shoulder knee defensive linemen mike wright foot and jarvis green shoulder tackles nick kaczur and oliver ross triceps center ryan wendell and running back benjarvus green ellis
771554 he made a nice breakup of a pass intended for randy moss on a deep out early in practice and generally was tight to his man when the ball came his way
771555 certainly tank is a very versatile player he has played in the secondary he has played close to the line of scrimmage hes been productive in the kicking game he can blitz and he can cover how that will all work out we will just have to see but he can do a number of different things and we will work with him in those different roles

771557 pro bowl wr larry fitzgerald to be interviewed on arizona cardinals report
771558 the fact is that benoit lost all his marbles and no one saw it coming
771559 we are looking at what we might do for 2011 how teams might qualify and we will look at the numbers of teams in the tournament
771560 weve got to review the world cup and see where were going and how we can make the world cup better
771561 we wont be increasing the numbers at all but the format will be different for qualification because we had 86 teams this time
771562 its a huge advantage for those teams to say they played in the world cup albeit only in the qualifying stages that gives them status but we may have to have them qualify in a different way
771563 we have nine options and that sounds ridiculous but the fact of the matter is weve been working on this for some time and everybody has an opinion
771564 everybody wants an integrated season but then when you ask them to shift their season there are reasons for them not doing it
771565 we cant squeeze the season in the way were doing theres just not the time in the season to play all the matches
771566 i am beginning to wonder what purpose it serves to anyone following rugby on a semi regular basis
771567 well it is an interesting philosophy and perhaps a little risky
771568 dont you think james sharman has all the hallmarks of a flaming homosexual
771569 you do these gentlemen an injustice by criticising them for offering opinions on current world concerns and issues and james in particular for misquoting him on his remarks on the all blacks attitude to wcup 2007
771570 the abs have not won anything globally for 20 years yes 20 years
771571 have they become a product of their own brainwashing machinary over the years
771572 in every wc they make themselves favourites by sound performances around the globe but they cannot win the the most important competition on the rugby map
771573 theres a sucker born every minute and two to take em
771574 the outrageous pre game strident hype of the new zealand supporters in pubs and cafes
771575 let us not ignore the fact that graham henry was removed from welsh rugby and that he left them in tatters as he simply did not understand a culture other than his own
771576 simply did not understand a culture other than his own
771577 the spate of recent ab injuries after forced lay offs might well be a warning that his preparation may have some flaws
771578 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign
771579 we do not inherit the world from our ancestors we borrow it from our children
771580 in our every deliberation we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations
771581 here is an almost incalculable power at our disposal yet how trifling the use we make of it it only serves to turn a few mills blow a few vessels across the ocean and a few trivial ends besides what a poor compliment do we pay to our indefatigable and energetic servant
771582 i say beware of all enterprises that require new clothes
771583 people are not only spoiling nature and the earth but they are also insulating themselves from it they always have a building a street a car a terrace paved with tile or something in between themselves and the earth man was made to relate to the things in the earth mineral as well as plant oxygen as well as animal however although everything we find in civilization has come from or has been produced out of the raw materials existing in the earth still it seems we have become more and more separated from the basic things of the earth man does not have the same healthy refreshment for his nervous or his physical system if he never gets his feet on the earth and his eyes nostrils ears and taste buds free from the sights sounds flavours and smells of machine concrete exhaust and other non natural things it is in nature among the things which god has created designed and brought forth himself that we are in the most natural atmosphere to be inspired
771584 it is frequently asserted that plants convert only 0 1 of solar energy into biomass therefore requiring unacceptable amounts of land for production of fuel feedstocks the c4 perennial grass miscanthus giganteus has proved a promising biomass crop in europe while switchgrass panicum virgatum has been tested at several locations in n america here replicated side by side trials of these two crops were established for the first time along a latitudinal gradient in illinois over 3 years of trials miscanthus giganteus achieved average annual conversion efficiencies into harvestable biomass of 1 0 30 t ha 1 and a maximum of 2 0 61 t ha 1 with minimal agricultural inputs the regionally adapted switchgrass variety cave in rock achieved somewhat lower yields averaging 10 t ha 1 given that there has been little attempt to improve the agronomy and genetics of these grasses compared with the major grain crops these efficiencies are the minimum of what may be achieved at this 1 0 efficiency 12 million hectares or 9 3 of current us cropland would be sufficient to provide 133 109 l of ethanol enough to offset one fifth of the current us gasoline use in contrast maize grain from the same area of land would only provide 49 109 l while requiring much higher nitrogen and fossil energy inputs in its cultivation
771585 using good croplands to feed our gas guzzlers may not be a very good idea
771586 with the engine operating as a generator able to predict load and speed changes
771587 a series hybrid where you have a 5l single cylinder engine that runs at wot a parallel hybrid that has a 2 0l engine that operates in the 2000rpm range with varying degrees of load
771588 the second setup might achieve better thermal efficiency and perhaps better fuel economy
771589 you need to avoid the danger of letting the engine accept too much of the passenger load variation rather than the battery otherwise you end up running an engine with significant overcapacity
771590 they are authentic arkansas razorbacks i got one for george and one for dick
771591 the protection units were needed due to the speakers were designed mainly for recording studios
771592 following brain stem testing that was carried out earlier today ben mullany has now passed away
771593 which elements in the community have helped to popularize the term
771594 we love you cowardly inconsistent pimping self hating strung out reckless idle niggers
771595 ima ride with my niggas die with my niggas get high with my niggas

771599 those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable
771600 in the social struggle we are either on the side of privilege or need
771601 how can we best address the oppressive mechanisms facing us and those facing our co religionists in so many redoubts scattered around the globe
771602 the african muslims may have been in the americas the slaves of christian masters but their minds were free
771603 we did the first jump at kirra just to see if he liked it because if he didnt i wouldnt pursue it
771604 i said to myself if he doesnt like it hes not doing it again but he loved it
771605 it was all fine though and when we landed he just got his ball and ran around in circles
771606 he was a normal happy dog and the jump didnt seem to scare him
771607 ive actually spoken to tv vet dr harry cooper many years ago when a team member was jumping with a dog
771608 someone had complained to the rspca about it so we contacted him to do a story on it and he said there was no issue as far as cruelty to animals
771609 we wanted to give them something more than just a tandem dive with two people
771610 that would have just been the same old thing but when you land with a dog well thats certainly something a bit special
771611 its exactly the same as a tandem skydive with people
771612 hes attached to me and he cant get out of it
771613 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
771614 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry emailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
771615 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
771616 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
771617 a fair and just solution to the problem of meaningful palestinian statehood
771618 al salm and al salaamah mean freedom from any external or internal ruination
771619 no soul is killed unjustly except that the elder son of adam cain shares in the stain of the crime that is because he was the first to innovate murder in the human family
771620 on the day no amount of wealth or children will be of any benefit the only one benefited will be one who comes before god with a rectified heart
771621 extent the greeting of peace to those you know and those you know not
771622 you will not enter paradise until you believe and you will not believe until you love one another shall i indicate to you something that will surely lead to your mutual love spread the greeting and spirit of peace between yourselves
771623 to rule based on that contained in the book of god and the tradition sunnah of his messenger peace and blessings of god upon him and refraining from ruling based on empty opinion
771624 justice is the basis of all human relations and a foundation of islamic rule
771625 surely the most beloved of people with god and the closest to him on the day of resurrection will be a just leader and the most hated of people and the furthest removed from him will be a tyrannical leader
771626 you bring your disputes to me for adjudication perhaps one of you is less eloquent than another and i rule against the wronged party on the basis of what i have heard therefore if i inadvertently grant one of you something owed to his brother do not take it for i am granting him something that constitutes a piece of hellfire
771627 that you provide food and extend the greeting of peace to those you know and those you know not
771628 o people those before you were ruined in that if a noble person among them stole something they left him alone on the other hand if a lower class person stole something they punished him
771629 all of you are shepherds and each of you will be asked concerning his flock
771630 no one humbles themselves for the sake of god except that god elevates them
771631 gentleness does not exist in anything except that it beautifies it and it is not removed from anything except that it defiles it
771632 the merciful people are those god will show mercy to
771633 i become the hearing with which he hears the sight with which he sees the hand with which he sieges and the feet that convey him in this state if he were to ask anything of me i would grant it and were he to seek my protection i would protect him
771634 she had come to understand that true human liberation would only come through the discovery of our true humanity
771635 from my mother i inherited the desire to constantly do better she was always trying to improve our situation under very difficult circumstances she taught me the importance of keeping your head to accomplish anything you need a clear head my siblings today who are not muslim have also not fallen into the trap of substance abuse i also learned that your dignity has nothing to do with your economic status
771636 it is obvious that war is big business i worked in the context of logistics and you see this impressive globalized logistical network that is set up basically to kill people then there is the business infrastructure that supports that and the tax dollars that are funneled into it as well war is big business and its nothing new
771637 they sent out the us calvary thousands of troops to get 38 people
771638 it was all about supporting the profiteering network that was benefiting financially from supplying that army
771639 it instilled a lot of discipline and respect for authority which are important in everyones life
771640 we were both very much in an activist mindset when we met both looking at it in the same way i think that you shouldnt become tired in trying to do something positive together and you should never reach a point in a marriage where you become complacent with each other never retire
771641 yes indirectly i wanted to learn how the world works in order to change it i was idealistic and highly motivated there is a big ummah out there and it needs a new direction
771642 i would often go into the woods even alone and just wander and lose myself i would sit down and reflect i went through a deep meditative and contemplative phase before i became a muslim
771643 when i was a growing up as a christian child every night we would stop and say our prayers and it was just communion with god oh god give me this help me with that thank you god i love you god now our kids dont commune with god we need to encourage our kids to communicate with god and have intimate conversations for many people prayer has become mechanical because they are not reflecting much on god before entering into it a person who rarely thinks about god will inevitably have difficulty reflecting in his prayers on the other hand someone who wakes up in the morning and remembers god reads quran every morning and prays on the prophet peace and blessings upon him someone who takes time to be conscious of god and remember invocations will find it a lot easier to be mindful of god in their prayers for the latter person prayer is just reinforcing and strengthening their general spirituality
771644 spirituality is very important and should be an active part of our lives our childrens lives and an active part of our educational curriculum the heart is then more sensitive to the creator and that enhances our attainment of education awareness of social justice ecological and environmental issues by being sensitive to the creator we are more sensitive to the creation spirituality gives us an awareness of those things that guard our relationship with the divine and that leads to a propensity to safeguard our relationship with other people and our environment
771645 a friend who had taken a salafi view of islam influenced the rest of us who were new muslims at the time however i became a kinder gentler salafi not the stern faced kind who tells you your hijab is too short your beard is too short everything is too short
771646 on a serious note just seeing the effect that sort of thinking had on people producing self righteous constantly condemning cynical overly critical rigid people i said to myself producing that sort of individual could not have been the goal of our prophet peace and blessings upon him it could not have been his mission i just figured something is wrong here this cant be what its all about so i started looking for other forms of islamic expression that is not to say that all salafis are like the type i have described here i know many wonderful balanced believers who would call themselves salafis these are just my personal experiences
771647 the standard curriculum that prevails in most western islamic schools has islamic studies and arabic courses as appendices what is really needed is a system based on a traditional islamic curriculum and the arabic language if there was a serious effort to use islam to enforce how other subjects are taught there wouldnt be a contradiction between the islamic and modern secular
771648 mathematics wouldnt be strictly abstract but include application in islamic laws for example teaching how percentages are relevant in inheritance laws and in zakat obligatory charity calculations in english we would have students read related islamic texts in addition to those legally mandated so all subjects that are taught history biology english would directly involve religious instruction islamize the curriculum have the core in arabic there is no reason why we cant take children from the first grade to twelfth and have them become fluent in arabic and islamic studies this will give them the ability to converse and participate in discourse on various islamic sciences with a firm rooting and understanding of the methodology of hadith understanding how the quran was compiled and translated throughout history memorizing the quran they wont be vulnerable to the negative arguments and thoughts that sway a lot of muslims
771649 its very important that we have credible educational institutions in the west so we can begin to produce our own scholars thats important because only children who have grown up in this environment can have an understanding of the issues and a command of the nuances of language to communicate effectively and address the problems of this society we know what the educational needs of our young people are we can structure programs and identify what is essential what is most beneficial for our situation everywhere in the world you see indigenous scholars for indigenous people
771650 first of all its not the prophetic way secondly bitterness and hatred distorts your ability to see things as they are so the prophet muhammad peace and blessings upon him said constantly dont become angry because at the heart of his mission was introducing us to reality emotional states affect the heart and that affects intellect and clarity of thought so it is very important to have a clear mind to be able to access things as rationally and pragmatically as possible anything that affects clarity of the mind be it physically such as intoxicants or emotionally or spiritually such as bitterness and anger must be avoided certainly there are situations where you need to be angry but our anger should be situational not a constant description of our condition
771651 there are no benefits to bitterness if one is exceedingly bitter then one tends to see other groups of people as being responsible for ones situation that feeling of victimization is not healthy rather it is a detriment to constructive action victimization usually leads to inaction because problems are always someone elses fault that being the case there is little i can do to fix them
771652 malcolm x was very much committed to serving his people and as his career broadened serving humanity i think that as muslims we need to focus on that message on that aspect of islam that this is not a self serving religion but a religion of service to others it is also not a religion of isolation islam does encourage meditation and contemplation and it is encouraged to go on temporary retreats such as in ramadan but not isolation meditation and contemplation are all part of making the individual stronger and better able to serve the community
771653 we see that malcolm x whatever he learned and whatever position he attained in his spiritual development he placed it at the service of the people i think that is a very important message additionally malcolm x is a bridge between the african american community and the muslim community because he was a muslim and he was also a champion of the african american people that is a reality and we need to utilize that legacy because these are times when muslims need as many allies as possible
771654 let us follow in the footsteps of malcolm x and let us reach out to the sister communities
771655 it would be positive for both eastern and western muslims for example in the issue of the moon sighting lets decide on a day based on the sighting in the area we live in that would avoid a lot of confusion and disunity especially pre ramadan we can be a positive example for eastern muslims if they knew what they were doing could not divide us perhaps they would be more inclined to uniting themselves
771656 concerning the cartoon controversy after all the demonstrations that took place there is still no danish apology there have been no real changes it has just left a lot of muslims frustrated we need to develop an agenda that is controlled by us and not defined by what the media tells us should be our interest that means defining the issues that are important to us on our terms
771657 if we are to have a whole and wholesome community the role of women in our mosques and other institutions must reflect the role of women in greater society if the role of women in a society is a domestic one then thats fine that is the societys equilibrium and balance but in the west there is growing disparity between men and women women are becoming better educated and that translates into a social situation where women including muslim women are functioning at every level of society in professions of medicine administration education every level though perhaps under represented in auto mechanics until islamic institutions reflect that inclusiveness for women were going to have a dysfunctional society we must accept the role of women in the general society as the role of women in our mosques with safeguards for the parameters that islam sets women are on the board of city council schools and they should be on the boards of mosques there is nothing in islam to prevent this but we must maintain islamic etiquette
771658 this is a balanced argument there is nothing to prevent them from positions on the board if they are the most qualified it is cultural schizophrenia if a man accepts going to work with women as his peers or as figures of authority on various boards but then doesnt accept that in the mosque also everyone regardless of gender should have equal access to the main prayer space and have the maturity to respect the space this is a valid argument made by credible scholars
771659 awareness emanates from the heart and if the heart is sound the whole body is sound if its corrupt the whole body is corrupt the commentary for that hadith further explains the parables for the individual both physically and spiritually on the physical level if the heart is not functioning properly to pump blood it will affect the body on a spiritual level if the heart is sound then the limbs of the body will do sound things but if it is sick then the limbs are going to do sick things
771660 it is also a parable for society the heart of society is the individual and if the individual is corrupt then the society is going to be corrupt society is characterized by the individuals comprising it and the wholesomeness or the corruption of the individual stems from the state of his or her heart the nature of our society will reflect that so we see a lot of sick hearts and as a result we are seeing the sort of things that we witness daily the heart of the individual is the heart of society
771661 all of you are shepherds and each of you will be asked concerning his flock
771662 no one humbles themselves for the sake of god except that god elevates him
771663 gentleness does not exist in anything except that it beautifies it and it is not removed from anything except that it defiles it
771664 the merciful people are those god will show mercy to
771665 i become the hearing with which he hears the sight with which he sees the hand with which he grasps and the feet that convey him in this state if he were to ask anything of me i would grant it and were he to seek my protection i would protect him

771667 no soul is killed unjustly except that the elder son of adam cain shares in the stain of the crime that is because he was the first to innovate murder in the human family
771668 on the day no amount of wealth or children will be of any benefit the only one benefited will be one who comes before god with a rectified heart

771677 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome
771678 of course there are some bishops who arent here and the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams spoke about how he intended to be in touch with them and consult with them and try and involve them in this process going forward
771679 we do need to stay engaged with each other and have a high quality level of relationships in order for us to discern the truth

771683 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
771684 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
771685 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
771686 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
771687 after last nights game pedro martinez provided a chilling assessment of the injury martinez finally had rotator cuff surgery at the end of the 2006 season despite pitching with the problem for years and when told how maine described his own pain on monday martinez nodded
771688 no in fact albert pujols will not be traded before the deadline
771689 now batting for your toronto blue jays the designated hitter
771690 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine
771691 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
771692 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
771693 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
771694 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
771695 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
771696 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
771697 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
771698 because the private health sector is going to be quite happy to provide further services for people who can pay but what about the four million who cant
771699 she had no criminal history nor did she have any known personal reasons to run away from home she left a hot meal uneaten on the table and did not take any possessions with her
771700 it is as though she simply disappeared off the face of the earth
771701 because it might make an impact to the texas shore were looking at activating resources including search and rescue and maybe military forces
771702 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
771703 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
771704 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
771705 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane

771707 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007

771709 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
771710 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
771711 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm

771720 this situation can then spill over into the local community and impact on local residents
771721 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
771722 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen
771723 were flight attendants we have to fly in the aircraft its just a natural request

771830 al final de mi vida espero que el material hist rico que he recogido entre en las conciencias y la memoria de mis compatriotas
771831 what we have now is a failed energy policy by bush cheney two oil men in the white house four dollar a gallon gasoline at the pump and what they are saying is lets have more of the same lets have more of big oil making record profits historic profits you see the quarterly reports that just came out who want to be subsidized they dont really want to compete and let them use those subsidies to drill oil in protected areas instead we are saying free the oil use it dont lose it theres 68 million acres in the lower 48 and 10 or 20 million acres in alaska where they are permitted where they could drill anytime this is a diversionary tactic from a failed energy policy
771832 the misrepresentation is being made that this is going to reduce the price at the pump
771833 we have debates everyday on the subject what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the hand maidens of the oil industry on the republican side

771835 quando fu giunto a questo punto del suo racconto golubcik rimase a lungo in silenzio ci parve ancora pi lungo il suo silenzio perch non beveva niente noi tutti bevevamo soltanto a piccoli sorsi dai nostri bicchieri per pudore e discrezione in quanto golubcik sembrava non badare al proprio il suo silenzio pareva in qualche modo un doppio silenzio chi racconta e interrompe la sua storia senza portare alle labbra il bicchiere che ha davanti a s suscita nei propri ascoltatori una strana angoscia noi tutti che ascoltavamo golubcik ci sentivamo angosciati ci vergognavamo di guardarlo negli occhi e fissavamo quasi inebetiti i nostri bicchieri se almeno avessimo udito il ticchettio di un orologio ma no nessun orologio ticchettava nessuna mosca ronzava e anche dalla strada immersa nella notte nessun rumore penetrava attraverso la spessa saracinesca metallica eravamo semplicemente alla merc di un silenzio mortale lunghe lunghe eternit sembravano trascorse dal momento in cui golubcik aveva cominciato il suo racconto eternit dico non ore lorologio a muro del ristorante era fermo eppure ognuno di noi gli lanciava unocchiata furtiva anche se sapevamo tutti che non funzionava anche se a tutti il tempo pareva abolito e le lancette sul quadrante bianco non erano pi soltanto nere ma addirittura tetre s tetre erano come leternit costanti nella loro testarda e quasi perversa staticit ci sembrava che non fosse perch lingranaggio era fermo che esse non si movessero bens per una sorta di cattiveria quasi a dimostrare quanto la storia che golubcik stava per narrarci fosse una storia eternamente valida nella sua desolazione indipendente dal tempo e dallo spazio dal giorno e dalla notte poich il tempo si era fermato anche il luogo dove ci trovavamo era al di fuori di ogni legge spaziale era come se non ci trovassimo sulla terra ferma ma sulle acque eternamente ondulate del mare eterno come su una nave ci pareva di essere e il nostro mare era la notte

771837 la neve aveva cominciato a cadere qualche ora prima dellinizio del travaglio prima nello spento grigiore del tardo pomeriggio a radi fiocchi poi con mulinelli turbini mossi dal vento ai margini del grande portico davanti alla casa lui le stava accanto nel vano della finestra guardava le raffiche violente gonfiarsi vorticare e posarsi al suolo nei dintorni si erano accese le luci e i rami degli alberi erano diventati bianchi
771838 si era sentito opprimere dalla consapevolezza che quella notte quando aveva messo sua figlia nelle mani di caroline gill era cambiato tutto la vita era andata avanti piena e soddisfacente agli occhi di tutti lui era un uomo di successo ma nei momenti pi imprevedibili durante un intervento o mentre rientrava in citt il ricordo della colpa commessa lo assaliva allimprovviso aveva abbandonato sua figlia quel segreto era come una barriera invalicabile tra lui e norah e aveva condizionato le loro esistenze

771847 until the end of my life i can hope that the historical material collected by me and presented to my readers enters the consciousness and memory of my fellow countrymen
771848 our bitter national experience can yet help us in a possible repeat of unstable social conditions it will warn us and ward us from destructive break downs
771849 this has cost us more than 25 million since 1995 when the sinkholes started opening up
771850 tourists from abroad dont know exactly where the sea is located and where the sinkholes are so they dont come as much anymore
771851 also i think there is antagonism that we are allowing such a valuable site as the dead sea to be destroyed
771852 a decision like this cannot be made without checking the ecological impact on the environment
771853 its possible that with a canal the sea will turn brown or red its possible it will stink because of the introduction of new chemical and biological substances into the water
771854 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard
771855 afterwards paul was absolutely mobbed with people who thought he should turn the story into a movie and i asked if i could play his mum
771856 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
771857 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
771858 we will not only host a quality and unique games but build a more scenic greener and more civilised city in a sustainable manner
771859 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
771860 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
771861 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
771862 they did their homework on what they wanted to achieve in terms of putting pressure on us
771863 they certainly targeted certain areas and got a good result out of it when youre a bit off and theyre putting on a bit of pressure it makes for a hard night
771864 you cant go from having a very good lineout to a debacle in one game
771865 what it does is refocus us in that area weve been going quite well in the lineouts until now and im sure that will be the case from here on as well
771866 the disappointing thing for us is that we didnt respond to it well enough
771867 its not one we will look back on with a lot of pride
771868 the all blacks grew an arm and a leg and were prepared to have a crack and get up and they closed the gap and did it successfully
771869 because they were able to build pressure on us in that area we werent able to create a good foundation
771870 we gave them no lineouts and gave them no platform
771871 in texas we execute the retarded sick and the dead

771875 i thought it would be fun to come down and wander around
771876 i like it i like that the streets are blocked off and theres no traffic to worry about
771877 were kind of running around im on the patio im inside im over at the bar
771878 a lot of families we have more families today than ever on sunday
771879 if you feel uncomfortable because youre in an alliance with crazy bitches thats fine
771880 we will have to balance the technological environmental and economic issues at the heart of this complex study
771881 its like asking a cat to guard a bowl of milk
771882 its an environmental question mark and thats why we are doing these studies
771883 its very important that we examine and understand all the potential environmental implications
771884 there is an interest internationally in saving the dead sea and this could also help bring water to the region that badly needs it
771885 we need to check all the options if the project is deemed unsuitable then we wont do it but if there are no problems found then why shouldnt we pursue it
771886 this is a major vision of the president of israel to use water and energy as a catalyst for peace and stability
771887 i have a feeling not enough money or time is being given to research to answer major questions good studies have to be done
771888 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard

771891 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
771892 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
771893 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
771894 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
771895 some people are for the very first time now accepting that there is a crisis
771896 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
771897 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
771898 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognizing and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
771899 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
771900 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
771901 i have no interest in being a martyr im just trying to be a good bishop

771928 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
771929 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
771930 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
771931 i tried to hit it as close as possible so i didnt leave myself any putts
771932 the fringe ended up being a lot slower the first time i really putted through the fringe all week the putt just seemed like the right shot at the time

771935 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
771936 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
771937 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors

771969 our bitter national experience can yet help us in a possible repeat of unstable social conditions it will warn us and ward us from destructive break downs
771970 and how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of mass arrests as for example in leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people had not simply sat there in their lairs paling in terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes hammers pokers or whatever else was at hand the organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding all of stalins thirst the cursed machine would have ground to a halt
771971 since returning to russia in 1994 solzhenitsyn has published eight two part short stories a series of contemplative
771972 if i would care to generalise and to say that the life of the jews in the camps was especially hard i could and would not face reproach for an unjust national generalisation but in the camps where i was kept it was different the jews whose experience i saw their life was softer than that of others
771973 but it is impossible to find the answer to the eternal question who is to be blamed who led us to our death to explain the actions of the kiev cheka secret police only by the fact that two thirds were jews is certainly incorrect
771974 my book was directed to empathise with the thoughts feelings and the psychology of the jews their spiritual component
771975 i have never made general conclusions about a people i will always differentiate between layers of jews one layer rushed headfirst to the revolution another to the contrary was trying to stand back the jewish subject for a long time was considered prohibited zhabotinsky a jewish writer once said that the best service our russian friends give to us is never to speak aloud about us
771976 richard wagner did not like the jews but was a great composer dostoyevsky was a great russian writer but had a very sceptical attitude towards the jews
771977 this is not a book about how the jews and russians lived together for 200 years but one about how they lived apart after finding themselves on the same territory this book is a weak one professionally factually it is so bad as to be beyond criticism as literature it is not of any merit
771978 trotskys idea was that the spread of anti semitism was partly down to objections about their entrance into the civil service there is something in this that they were not just passive spectators of the revolution they were part victims and part perpetrators
771979 it is not a question that anyone can write about without a huge amount of bravery and it needs doing in russia because the jews are quite often written about by fanatics mr solzhenitsyns book seems much more measured than that
771980 the question of ethnicity did not have any importance either in the revolution or the story of the nkvd this was a social revolution and those who served in the nkvd and cheka were serving ideas of social change
771981 if solzhenitsyn writes that there were many jews in the nkvd it will increase the passions of anti semitism which has deep roots in russian history i think it is better not to discuss such a question now
771982 best unknown prospect in the world and he played as a 17 year old in the 2006 fiba world championships known for his great ball handling skills and surprising dunking ability chen only weighs in at 165 pounds itll be very interesting to see how he performs against other renowned back up point guards around the world rubio chris paul deron williams because chen could end up being an nba draft pick some time in the future hes one of the quickest players in the world and another member of the cbas guangdong southern tigers listed as a power forward wang lei is merely 66
771983 he is really a point guard and he competed really well in training camp

772077 in expanding the role of our armed forces have we diminished our civilian capabilities our diplomatic and development assistance institutions and have we done so in a way that undermines our national security
772078 there has been a migration of functions and authorities from u s civilian agencies to the department of defense between 2002 and 2005 the share of u s official development assistance channeled through the pentagon budget surged from 5 6 percent in 2002 to 21 7 percent in 2005 rising to 5 5 billion much of this increase has gone towards activities in iraq and afghanistan but it still points to an expanding military role in what were traditionally civilian programs i share the concern that secretary of defense robert gates recently raised the military he said has become more involved in a range of activities that in the past were perceived to be the exclusive province of civilian agencies and organizations this has led to concern about whats seen as a creeping militarization of americas foreign policy this is not an entirely unreasonable sentiment
772079 first the increasing dominance of the military in our foreign policy may inadvertently limit our options when the military is the most readily available option it is more likely to be used whether or not it is the best choice finally militaries are good at winning wars and training armies but in my view we do not want soldiers training lawyers or setting up court systems or instructing health care workers on hiv aids prevention or running a micro finance program out of necessity our men and women in uniform have gotten very good at this but it is not their primary mission war fighting is
772080 the state department plays the primary role in overseeing foreign assistance activities in practice the department of defense is taking on more and more responsibility for traditionally foreign assistance programs how can we ensure that state plays its proper and necessary role
772081 the mission to stabilize and reconstruct a nation is one that civilians must lead but for too long we have not had sufficient numbers of trained prepared and supported civilians who could provide that leadership as a result over the past 20 years over the course of 17 significant stabilization and reconstruction missions in which the united states has been involved too much of the effort has been borne by our men and women in uniform
772082 as we work to increase civilian capacity to perform the diplomatic and development missions demanded by our national security strategy we are grateful and better off for the defense departments contribution of expertise personnel and resources in support of our work our nation is safer and stronger when our lead national security agencies are united in purpose dods contribution is not only meeting military requirements but directly advancing the goal of our diplomacy a world of democratic well governed states that respond to the needs of their people and act responsibly in the international system
772083 in a past report issued in november we found that during the bush administrations tenure up until that time the congress had denied some 7 6 billion that the president requested in his regular foreign aid budget with this track record on the foreign affairs 150 budget account it should not be a shockingly unexpected development when the executive branch turns to the defense 050 account as an alternative a budget that is larger by a factor of at least twelve
772084 this committee should carry out vigorous oversight on the issue of the role of the military in foreign policy it is as important to listen to our ambassadors to get a handle on this issue as to officials in headquarters studies hearings such as this and appropriate legislative and budget decisions will go a long way toward keeping the right balance struck

772115 additionally since lego bricks are infinitely reusable i can build and test prototypes much faster than i could in other mediums im excited to take my experiments to a new level ive never tried to build a robot that could function under these conditions and function right the very first time 100 000 feet above ground is no place for a mistake
772116 why did you make it look like an lcd clock
772117 why limit your design to old technology that limits the usability of your design these old lcd clocks are hard to read but it was the best technology at the time
772118 there are so many different directions we can go in
772119 one of the songs has a led zeppelin feel one of them has more of a devo feel so its led devo or something along those lines i feel like the headspace were in now the glass ceilings been shattered were excited to see how far we can take this thing
772120 so were trying to steer columbia in the right direction
772121 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
772122 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to
772123 i think is a positive step so there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bi partisan group
772124 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
772125 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
772126 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional offshore drilling is wrong
772127 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
772128 and what that means is that were going to try to get things done at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done

772136 the business community is already doing an awful lot in areas like western australia and the northern territory and queensland
772137 i think this comes at a very important time and a very good time
772138 we are short of people we are short of skills so there is not a better time to take this initiative
772139 the key to economic progression is to get economies going within the communities and real jobs will lead to real economic gains which can be shared throughout the communities so it is an excellent idea
772140 i would hope that we would be incorporated in the plan

772187 is nuclear power essential to addressing climate change and energy independence
772188 a huge range of energy options available to australia beyond nuclear
772189 energy efficiency and renewable energy such as solar and wind
772190 a waste is just a resource in the wrong place
772191 we are making a commitment to reduce offset or displace all of our greenhouse gas emissions by 2020
772192 enough potential in energy efficiency and renewable energy such as solar and wind that we can do what we have to do on climate based on them alone without building new nuclear power plants
772193 considered in watts per square metre nuclear has astronomical advantages over its competitors
772194 even if we could do it theoretically without nuclear at what cost
772195 i agree that a cost basis per carbon avoidance for utilizing new sources is one of many useful yard sticks how do renewables look today on such a basis if i need large amounts of power now or in the next seven years
772196 exelon will not commit to building new nuclear plants however until we are satisfied that our conditions for safety regulatory stability bipartisan federal state and local support spent fuel management and cost have been met
772197 i personally think nuclear is a non starter in the article we were not trying to choose sides only to point out the mitigation technologies that are already in place however i cannot imagine that in this era of concerns about terrorism that we are going to start the production of fissionable material all over the world it is disingenuous when the bush administration says that the way to solve this problem is through coal and nuclear
772198 unit 4 at chernobyl contains characteristics of both containment and confinement there appear to be two regions that appear to be designed to withstand 27 psi and 57 psi these volumes are in turn interconnected with two suppression pools via pressure relief valves and downcomers the remaining portions of the plant are housed within a confinement structure
772199 denton urges industry to settle doubts about mark i containment inside n r c june 9 1986 pp 1 3
772200 if you try to solve even one wedge of this problem with nuclear it would require a doubling in the amount of nuclear power deployed solving the problem entirely with nuclear means increasing deployment by a factor of 10 and if you calculate how many of these plants would have to be in countries like sudan and afghanistan you are just not going to do it
772201 a near term decision to reprocess us commercial spent nuclear fuel would be a serious mistake with costs and risks far outweighing its potential benefits
772202 reprocessing is far outpacing the use of the resulting plutonium as fuel with the result that over 240 tons of separated weapons usable civilian plutonium now exists in the world a figure that will soon surpass the amount of plutonium in all the worlds nuclear weapons arsenals combined
772203 w e do not believe that a convincing case can be made on the basis of waste management considerations alone that the benefits of advanced closed fuel cycle schemes would outweigh the attendant safety environmental and security risks and economic costs
772204 a large contribution from nuclear energy is not only clearly feasible eminently affordable and better than most anything else from the standpoint of safety and public health but so important to addressing the climate change challenge that the world simply cannot do without it
772205 a large contribution from nuclear energy is probably not feasible because of resource constraints and public acceptance if feasible then still probably not as cheap as renewables and in any case undesirable because of waste safety and proliferation and we can meet the climate challenge without it
772206 the nrc has become a wholly owned subsidiary of nei
772207 keeping the terrorists guessing about our defenses was presumably one motivation for the secrecy however it might also reflect the commissions desire to play down its acquiescence to the nuclear industrys hubristic view that the plants are nearly invulnerable the commission doesnt seem to have learned the lesson of those attacks not a thing will be done to reduce the vulnerability of reactors to strikes from the air
772208 one of the reasons for children being less active is that children are spending less time engaged in physical activity during school daily participation in school physical education among adolescents dropped 14 percentage points over the last 13 years from 42 in 1991 to 28 in 2003 in addition less than one third 28 of high school students meet currently recommended levels of physical activity children have become more sedentary and spend a considerable amount of time with media one study found that time spent watching tv videos dvds and movies averaged slightly over 3 hours per day among children aged 8 18 years several studies have found a positive association between the time spent viewing television and increased prevalence of overweight in children media use and specifically television viewing may displace time children spend in physical activities contribute to increased energy consumption through excessive snacking and eating meals in front of the tv influence children to make unhealthy food choices through exposure to food advertisements and lower childrens metabolic rate

772227 sooner or later every major dispute in the united states ends up in the courtroom
772228 do not have the capacity to resolve all of our varied legal problems
772229 the legislative process is broken and unduly influenced by special interests
772230 a hands off approach means less work for judges and who wants to weigh costs and benefits of dreary document and e discovery requests it also means less likelihood of committing reversible error resulting in a remand no appellate court ever spanks a district court for permitting too much discovery finally it increases the uncertainty and expense of litigation and thus the incentives of the parties to settle and take a case off of their dockets
772231 recommendations on the selection of judges and the improvement of the judicial selection system in new york state
772232 a system of procedure acceptable generally throughout the world could not require jury trial and would require much more limited discovery than is typical in the united states this in turn has led us to conclude that the scope of the proposed principles is limited to commercial disputes and excludes categories of litigation such as personal injury and wrongful death actions because barring jury trial in such cases would be unacceptable in the united states

772303 facebook just underscored the risk you have of being disintermediated from its platform it reminded people that it can build apps that look really similar and it can relegate developers applications to second position and i think thats going to have a meaningful impact on how the venture investor community views facebook applications and applications built generally for social networks

772583 the existence of sovereignty of the nation or political sovereignty is indicated by certain signs or notes which are universal these are independence authority supremacy unity and majesty a divisive sovereignty is a contradiction of the supremacy which is implied in all of its necessary conception and inconsistent with its substance in the organic will it is indefeasible it can not through legal forms and legist devices be annulled and avoided nor can it be voluntarily abdicated or voluntarily resumed but involves a continuity of power and action it works through all members and in all organs and offices of the state

772585 one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known
772586 the largest and most successful undercover investigation in federal drug enforcement history
772587 i would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my deep appreciation for the vigorous antidrug trafficking policy that you have adopted which is reflected in the numerous expulsions from panama of accused drug traffickers the large seizures of cocaine and precursor chemicals that have occurred in panama and the eradication of marijuana in panama territory
772588 during my entire tenure with nnbis and the south florida task force i never saw any intelligence that gen noriega was involved in the drug trade in fact we always held up panama as the model in terms of cooperation with the u s in the war on drugs remember a grand jury indictment is not a conviction and if the noriega case ever comes to trial i will look at the evidence of that jurys findings but until that happens i have no first hand evidence of the generals involvement my experience ran in the opposite direction

772599 through this blessed jihad in yunnan this time the turkestan islamic party warns china one more time our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed we warn china and the international community for the last time that those spectators athletes particularly the muslims who are planning to attend the olympics please change your intention from going to china please do not stand together with the faithless people the turkistan islamic party volunteers will conduct violent military actions against individuals departments venues and activities that are related to the olympics in china
772600 the pakistani terrorism sponsoring activities along the silk road were the primary instrument of islamabads regional strategy the isi sponsored insurgency and terrorism along the western gateways to the prc were strategic developments with grave ramifications
772601 china reportedly said that east turkestan uyghur islamic terrorists are operating on pakistans soil and trained in special camps in its territory this is the first time beijing administration charged pakistan for harboring anti china elements in its soil the revelation came in a court document in the trial of jailed canadian celil in which it was mentioned that celil joined the east turkistan liberation organisation etlo way back in 1997 and acted as a senior instructor in kyrgyzstan as per the document celil allegedly recruited people and sent them to various training camps on the pamir plateau in pakistan territory etlos prime objective is to carve an independent east turkestan by uniting parts of china and kyrgyzstan

772610 the iran u s crisis is spinning out of control tehran is willing to buy time in the coming four months to avoid a crisis
772611 he came here to convey the message of the french president
772612 it is absurd because at maximum he can convey this message that the threat of the west is serious which already is known to iran
772613 iran has accepted the idea of freeze for freeze but it does not make it public because of national pride
772614 iran does not want to fall in the trap laid by the europeans if it says publicly it accepts freeze for freeze the europeans would take it one step ahead
772615 on the whole iran and syria are in unison and before making any important decision the other country should be consulted

772618 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on

772623 singer and composer randy newmans wry and sometimes raw musical commentary has become a big part of the american cultural landscape

772626 several members attended the session but the meeting was adjourned because we had not reached a quorum
772627 for the first time in the history of our nation we come upon a development that we are unfamiliar with and that we cannot remember whereby the ruling party in our midst will come and offer up jerusalem even to the worst of our enemies
772628 israel does not need general elections now in light of the existential challenges facing us
772629 i wouldnt advise anyone to base the future on polls
772630 the polls are a mood and this will change im sure that i will win the primaries
772631 it is very strange that livni who prides herself on being among the partys founders is unwilling to state explicitly that this is her home it raises questions and looks really bad from a public standpoint
772632 she intends to win and isnt dealing with other things
772633 we dont need general elections at a time like this when such complex matters are on the agenda we must form a national unity government and contend with these challenges
772634 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain
772635 great strength of thought and insight its design is well above the abilities of an ordinary mind it is more complicated than a nuclear bomb
772636 came as friends but held a concealed dagger behind their backs
772637 it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non jewish communities in palestine
772638 if a world government is to work smoothly certain economic conditions will have to be fulfilled various raw materials are essential to industry of these at present one of the most important is oil probably uranium though no longer needed for the purposes of war will be essential for industrial use of nuclear energy there is no justification in the private ownership of such essential raw material sand i think we should include in undesirable ownership not only ownership by individuals or companies but also separate states the raw material without which industry is impossible should belong to the international authority and granted to separate nations
772639 the u s must build a solid relationship with iraq for the future
772640 iraq retains its heavy handed approach to foreign affairs and is working hard at making chemical and biological weapons and new missiles
772641 directly into iraqs planned missile tank and armored personnel carrier industries
772642 access to the persian gulf and key friendly states in that area is vital to u s national security
772643 our ability to influence iraqi behavior in areas from lebanon to the middle east peace process an oblique reference to israel is enhanced by expanded trade
772644 a key component of the relationship and failure to approve the loans will feed saddams paranoia and accelerate his swing against us
772645 tantamount to a slap in the face for the italians
772646 from being cancelled as this would exacerbate the already strained foreign policy relations with iraq
772647 i suggest that in a free society owned by the people the american people ought to know what we told ambassador glaspie to tell saddam hussein because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort and did not accomplish most of our objectives
772648 the victim of a terrible fraud the banks good name is of great importance as the italian state is a majority owner
772649 our best attempt to thwart any further congressional enquiry by the house banking committee into bnl loans is to have you contact chairman gonzalez directly
772650 the national security council is providing coordination for the administrations response to congressional documents requests for iraq related material
772651 issues of executive privilege national security etc alternatives to providing documents should be explored
772652 it is likely that the u s intelligence agencies were aware of relations with iraq the cia continues to be uncooperative in attempts to discover information about its knowledge of or involvement in the funding of iraq by bnl atlanta
772653 the timing of the accusations against judge sessions makes me wonder if an attempt is being made to pressure him not to conduct an independent investigation
772654 the justice department will not participate in the fbi inquiry and the fbi will not share information
772655 since very high level officials may well have been knowledgeable of or involved in an effort to absolve bnl rome of complicity in the activities of bnl atlanta no arm of the executive branch can investigate u s government conduct in this case without at least the appearance of a conflict of interest
772656 secret u s government involvement in arms sales to iraq
772657 address the repeated clear failures and obstruction of the leadership of the justice department the best way to accomplish this is to do the right thing and submit your resignation
772658 a truly independent investigation is required to determine whether federal crimes were committed in the governments handling of the bnl case
772659 demonstrates that powerful people with powerful allies can commit serious crimes in high office deliberately abusing the public trust without consequences the iran contra cover up which has continued for six years has now been completed this office was informed only within the past two weeks on dec 11 1992 that president bush had failed to produce to investigators his highly relevant contemporaneous notes the bush diary despite repeated requests for such documents in the light of president bushs own misconduct in withholding his daily diary we are gravely concerned about his decision to pardon others who have lied to congress and obstructed official investigations

772661 the impact of the rising fuel prices on the local economy is extremely serious

772666 gentlemen the vital importance of securing adequate supplies of mineral oil both for present and future needs of the united states has been forcibly brought to the attention of the department the development of proven fields and exploration of new areas is being aggressively conducted in many parts of the world by nationals of various countries and concessions for mineral rights are being actively sought it is desired to have the most complete and recent information regarding such activities by either united states citizens or by others
772667 you are accordingly instructed to obtain and forward promptly from time to time information regarding mineral oil concession change of ownership of oil property or important changes in ownership or control of corporate companies concerned with oil production or distribution
772668 information regarding development of new fields or increased output of producing areas should also be forwarded comprehensive data are desired and reports should not be limited to points specifically mentioned above but should include information regarding all matters of interest affecting the mineral oil industry which may arise from time to time
772669 all proper diplomatic support in obtaining and operating oil producing property abroad should be backed by the government
772670 the foreign policy of the government expressed in the phrase open door consistently prosecuted by the department of state has made it possible for our american interests abroad to be intelligently fostered and the needs of our people to no slight extent to be appropriately safeguarded
772671 the penalty for commercial and industrial efficiency inevitably is war
772672 mr madero told me that as soon as the rebels maderos forces made a good showing of strength several leading bankers in el paso texas stood ready to advance him i believe the sum was 100 000 and that standard oil interests had bought over the provisional government of mexico they gov gonzalez and secretary of state hernandez said standard oil interests were backing madero in his revolution
772673 we do not love him cowdray for we think that between him and carden sir lionel carden british minister to mexico are large part of our troubles are made
772674 we can have no sympathy with those who seek to seize the power of government to advance their own personal interests or ambitions
772675 what does the oil or commerce of mexico amount to in comparison with the close friendship between the united states and great britain the two countries should agree on this primary principle to leave their oil interest to fight their own battles legal and financial
772676 it seems to me that the united states must avail itself of the enterprise and ability and the pioneer spirit of its citizens to acquire and to have and to hold a reasonable portion of the worlds petroleum supplies if it does not it will find that supplies of petroleum not within the boundaries of the united states territory will be rapidly acquired by citizens and governments of other nations
772677 and lend their assistance i e u s military forces to the restoration of order and maintenance of peace in that unhappy country and the placing of administrative functions in the hands of capable and patriotic citizens of mexico
772678 order and maintenance of peace in that unhappy country by placing the administrative functions in the hands of capable and patriotic citizens of mexico
772679 the present situation in mexico is incompatible with the fulfillment of international obligations on the part of mexico with the civilized development of mexico herself and with the maintenance of tolerable political and economic conditions in central america
772680 mexico lies at last where all the world looks on central america is about to be touched by great routes of the worlds trade and intercourse running from ocean to ocean at the isthmus
772681 convey to the authorities an intimation that any maltreatment of americans is likely to raise the question of intervention
772682 it is the clear judgment that it is the immediate duty of huerta to retire from the mexican government and that the united states government must now proceed to employ such means as may be necessary to secure this result
772683 huerta has to be cut off from foreign sympathy and aid and from domestic credit whether moral or material and to force him out if general huerta does not retire by force of circumstances it will become the duty of the united states to use less peaceful means to put him out
772684 there is a more hopeful prospect of peace of security of property and early payment of foreign obligations if mexico is left to the forces now reckoning with one another there
772685 american imperialism is a fatal product of economic evolution it is useless to try and persuade our northern neighbor not to be imperialistic they cannot help being so no matter how excellent their intentions let us study the natural laws of economic imperialism in the hope that some method may be found by which instead of blindly opposing them we mitigate their action and turn it to our advantage

772688 great strength of thought and insight its design is well above the abilities of an ordinary mind it is more complicated than a nuclear bomb
772689 we can begin with the most critical problems of population growth
772690 we call it stabilized but what kind of stability would be possible
772691 it is not a world that any of us would want to live in
772692 there are of course many ways in which the death rates can go up in a thermonuclear age war can accomplish it very quickly and decisively famine and disease are natures ancient checks on population growth and neither one has disappeared from the scene
772693 there is a single theme behind all of our work we must reduce population growth either they do it our way through nice clean methods or they will get the kind of a mess that we have in el salvador or iran or beirut once population growth is out of control it requires authoritarian government even fascism to reduce it civil war can help things but it would have to be greatly expanded to reduce population quickly you have to pull all males into the fighting and kill significant numbers of fertile child bearing age females
772694 low class element of society must be brought under total control trained and assigned to duties at an early age which can be accomplished by the quality of education which must be the poorest of the poor the lower classes must be trained to accept their position long before they have an opportunity to query it
772695 technically children must be orphaned in day care centers under government control
772696 we have the resources to attack the vitality options and mobility of the individuals in society by knowing through our social scientist understanding and manipulating and attacking their sources of social energy income and therefore their physical mental and emotional strengths and weaknesses
772697 by measuring the economic habits by which the sheep try to run from their problems and escape from reality via the medium of entertainment it is absolutely possible applying
772698 the balance of power will provide the stability that the world of the 21st century is likely to achieve rent as it will be by passionate tribalism and by such seemingly insoluble issues like that posed by mass migration from the south to the north and from farm to city
772699 a great change that will come about as a result of emerging conflicts between peoples who live side by side and which will by their intensity take primacy over their other conflicts is that political rivalry will be within regions rather than between them
772700 the american people do not know economic science and care little about it hence they are always ripe for war they cannot avoid war notwithstanding their religious morality nor can they find in religion the solution to their earthly problems they are knocked out of shape by economic experts who cause shockwaves that wreck budgets and buying habits the american public is yet to realize that we control their buying habits
772701 our research has established that the simplest mode of gaining control of people is to keep them undisciplined and in the dark of basic systems and principles while at the same time keeping them disorganized confused and distracted by issues which are of relatively little import
772702 in addition to our less direct long range penetration methods this can be accomplished by a disengagement of mental activities and providing low quality programs of public education in mathematics logic system designs and economics and by discouraging technical creativity
772703 our mode calls for emotional stimulus increased use of amplifiers which induce self indulgence whether direct television programs or advertising
772704 of primary importance is the revision of history and law and subjecting the populace to the deviant creation thus shifting thinking from personal needs to constructed fabricated outside priorities the general rule is that there is profit in
772705 when government is able to seize private property without just compensation it is certain that people are ripe for surrender and consenting to slavery and legal encroachment
772706 each class therefore guarantees its level of income and hence controls the class immediately below it thereby preserving the class structure one of the best examples of this was found in
772707 the sovereignty of the elite is threatened when the lower classes through communications and education become informed and envious of the power and possessions of the class above them
772708 until such times it is essential to recognize that public consent is still the essential key to the release of energy in the process of economic amplification
772709 it applies equally to the elite and the lower classes but there is a definite difference in the manner in which both these classes approach the solution of the problem
772710 in the simplest of terms what the subconscious longing demands is an earthly god to eliminate risks from their lives put food on the table and pat them on the back in a comforting way when things dont go well
772711 ever present in humans is a desire to control or subdue others who disturb their daily existence however they are unable to cope with the moral and religious issues such actions would raise so they give the task to professional hit men which we collectively call politicians
772712 the services of politicians are engaged for a number of reasons which in the main are listed in the following order 1 to obtain the longed for security without managing it
772713 we can readily divide a nation into two sub categories the political sub nation and the docile sub nation the politicians hold quasi military jobs of which the lowest is the police force next come attorneys the presidential level is run by the international bankers the docile sub nation finances the political machine by consent that is to say through taxation the sub nation remains attached to the political sub nation the latter feeding off it and growing stronger until the day comes when it is strong enough to devour its creator the people

772717 i think the idea is to be very bloggy its going to be very opinionated
772718 some of the stories will have a political angle but not even 50 of them will but yes
772719 were very happy to be a part of this wed encourage it in fact its a chance for us to just go through whats been going on and clear the air so i think neither of us expect anything serious to come out of it

772727 its big brother to attack us like they did with hussein
772728 controlling a society from an individual unit right through to millions of such units i e people and the society and nation they collectively make up
772729 special activities means activities conducted in support of national foreign policy objectives abroad which are planned and executed so that the role of the united states is not apparent or acknowledged publicly and functions in support of such activities but which are not intended to influence the united states political processes public opinion policies or media and do not include diplomatic activities or collection and production of intelligence or related support actions

772738 complaints were filed with the league of nations commission on mandates which blamed the problems on an inadequate security force

772765 the only acts of aggression or breaches of peace the charter is sure to be geared up to suppress are those committed by small nations that is to say by the nations which are least able and unlikely to kindle another world conflict even in these cases mr president investigation and preventative action can be arbitrarily paralyzed by any of the big five powers which are permanent members of the security council
772766 thus any small nation which enjoys the patronage or serves as a tool or puppet of one of the big powers is as immune to interference as the big five themselves let us face the fact in the charter we have an instrument for arresting acts of war by countries which lack the power of making war the menace of large scale conflict does not reside in quarrels among themselves such quarrels can be limited and isolated
772767 the menace lies rather when the small powers act in interest of a great neighbor and are provoked into their act by that neighbor but in that case the veto privilege which makes the big power immune to united nations action can operate to make the small satellite nation immune the preventative machinery works smoothly until the point of real danger is reached the point where a nation is strong enough to precipitate a world war is involved and can then go dead
772768 we may assume in fact that every small country could be under temptation and pressure to seek a big power patron only in that way can it obtain an indirect share in the monopoly of control vested in the big five one of the faults of the charter mr president is that its punitive and coercive leverage could be applied only against a truly small independent nation
772769 at the price of its independence one of these nations could free itself from coercive authority of the charter by the simple expedient of making a deal with a veto nation
772770 in some respects it is a pretty weak reed it does nothing to stop a war instigated by any of the big five powers gives each nation complete freedom to make war our only hope therefore to maintain world peace is that none of the big five nations will choose to make war
772771 no part of the funds appropriated in this or in any other act shall be used to pay any person firm or corporation or any combination of persons firms or corporations to conduct a study or plan when or how or in what circumstances the government of the united states should surrender this country and its people to any foreign power
772772 it is illegal to use funds for any project that promotes one world government or one world citizenship
772773 how could the u n authorize the use of force against iraq i e declare war when it has no sovereignty and why did our representatives go with such a travesty and violation of our constitution why have our representatives gone along with such gross violations of the constitution they are sworn to uphold
772774 mr chairman of course you know that our government peace program is no peace the movement is led by the same old warmongers still masquerading as the princes of peace who involved us in war while pretending their purpose was to keep us out of war a very apt description of diplomacy by deception like lend lease and other bills which involved us in war while promising to keep us out of war this measure the u n treaty will involve us in every war hereafter
772775 to vote for this proposal is to give approval to world communism why else would it have the full support of all shades of communism elsewhere this u n measure strikes at the very heart of the constitution it provides that the power to declare war shall be taken from congress and given to the president here is the essence of dictatorship and dictatorial control all else must inevitably tend to follow
772776 the president is given absolute powers which the u s constitution does not give to at any time he elects and upon any pretext whatsoever snatch our sons and daughters away from their homes to fight and die in battle not only for as long as he pleases but as may suit the majority members of the international organization bear in mind the united states will be in the minority so that the policies relating to the length of time our soldiers will be kept in foreign lands in any future wars will rest more with foreign nations than our own
772777 i feel very strongly about it the u n charter because now is the time for senators to determine what the charter means we should not wait for a year or a year and a half when conditions will be different from immediate post wartime i do not want to see any senator withdraw judgment until a year and a half from now
772778 the constitution in itself never yields to treaty or enactment it neither changes with time or does it in theory bend to the force of circumstance the congress derives its powers to legislate from the constitution which is the measure of its authority and any enactment of the congress which is opposed to its provisions or is not within the grant of powers made by it is unconstitutional therefore no law and obligatory upon no one the constitution imposes no restriction on power but it is subject to implied restrictions that nothing can be done under it which changes the constitution of the country nor rob a department of government or any of the states of its constitutional authority congress and the senate in a treaty cannot give substance to a treaty greater than itself or delegated power of the senate and house
772779 as to the extent of a treaty power the constitution says nothing i e it is reserved prohibited but it evidently cannot be unlimited the power exists only under the constitution and every treaty inconsistent with a provision of the constitution is therefore inadmissible and according to the constitution law ipso facto null and void
772780 to hold the treaty making power as boundless is to make the constitution blank paper by construction

772782 we again have the chance to retrieve and establish not a league of nations but the present united nations charter although 80 percent of its provisions in the u n charter are in substance the same as those of the league of nations in 1919
772783 that the charter of the united nations become the supreme law of the land and that judges in every state shall be bound thereby anything in the constitution of any state to the contrary not withstanding
772784 there can be no treaty that will bind the government of
772785 very well that in its very nature is altogether domestic and cannot be the subject of a treaty
772786 it is not because it is domestic it is because the constitution has put that business in the hands of congress exclusively
772787 no mr president not necessarily so because the raising of revenue is purely a domestic matter it lies at the foundation of the life of the nation and it must be exercised by government alone without the consent or participation of a foreign power or world body
772788 in the year 1506 the states general of the kingdom of france assembled at tores engaged louis xii to break a treaty he had concluded with the emperor maximilian and archduke philip his son because the treaty was pernicious to the kingdom they also decided that neither the treaty nor the oath that accompanied it could be binding on the kingdom who had no right to alienate the property of the crown
772789 the united nations for three and a half decades has been indulging in a gigantic unfettered conspiracy mostly at the u s taxpayers expense to enslave our republic in a world government dominated by the soviet union and its third world having had enough of this freewheeling conspiracy more and more responsible officials and thinking citizens are ready to pull out

772807 this op is significant in that it signals a step forward for the ias ability to conduct self sustained and long term unilateral ops in the salah ad din province

772811 entities will help improve communication between business people and developers said lyn robison an analyst with the application platforms group at the burton group

773025 basically it just shows up as fluid or swelling in the bone there is a lot of inflammation there when it is in the bone it is a stress fracture
773026 but if it went unchecked it would just progressively get worse

773133 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
773134 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
773135 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
773136 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
773137 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
773138 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead

773290 das war ein moment auf den ich seit so vielen jahren hingearbeitet habe
773291 er wird noch mehr rennen gewinnen in diesem jahr und in den jahren danach
773292 wenn schon alles klar scheint nur noch zwei runden zu fahren sind und du dann etwas h rst und der motor platzt dann ist das ganz gewiss kein tolles gef hl der rennsport kann grausam sein
773293 wir kennen solche ausf lle aus der vergangenheit aber es ist nun mal die allerwichtigste aufgabe das auto ins ziel zu bringen
773294 eine der ltesten regeln im motorsport lautet um erster zu werden musst du zuerst ins ziel kommen das klingt abgedroschen ist aber wahr
773295 die berraschung war aber dass unsere pace nicht so war wie sie h tte sein sollen
773296 es h ngt davon ab wer es an diesem tag hinbekommt
773297 wenn man das setup die reifen oder das fahren nicht perfekt hinbekommt sind sofort drei oder vier fahrer vor dir
773298 selbst wenn es schief l uft muss man punkte mitnehmen
773299 pl tzlich wurde das auto in kurve eins auf der linken seite instabil und ich dachte schon ich h tte einen fehler gemacht
773300 in der zweiten kurve habe ich dann begriffen was passiert war
773301 es muss etwas an der schulter des reifens eingedrungen sein
773302 wir haben keine tr mmerteile in der lauffl che entdecken k nnen aber es besteht die m glichkeit eines schnitts in der seitenwand
773303 ohne den reifenschaden w re er der sieger gewesen aber es ist sehr gut wenn der teamkollege dann da ist
773304 es wird aber interessant sein zu erfahren was bei den anderen autos passiert ist denn es ist ungew hnlich dass es so viele feuer gibt

773307 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
773308 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
773309 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
773310 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality

773318 i had a great match last night i played rocket tennis but that was not possible against andy today weve known each other since we were 13 or 14
773319 we used to watch these kind of matches on television and now we are playing them
773320 it was really hot but ive played all of my matches in these conditions
773321 but by the end we were both tired it was really getting to us

773324 dealing with aids now will require a long term response
773325 we are very worried about the wrong idea that we should stop fueling funds for hiv aids
773326 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health
773327 we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia

773331 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
773332 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
773333 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
773334 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
773335 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
773336 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
773337 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
773338 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
773339 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
773340 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
773341 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
773342 but the second thing we have 7 000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
773343 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
773344 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny

773361 that although the war on terror will be occasionally military it is primarily an intelligence and law enforcement operation that requires cooperation around the world
773362 even where we found some success against al qaida in pakistan and iraq the military played a background or surrogate role the bulk of the action was taken by intelligence police and in some cases local forces
773363 i think we should skip the lesson this week and just get to know you
773364 put the chair down or youll crack your head open
773365 the prophet is concerned about the missionary work in this steake here in albuquerque
773366 she drinks a lot she wouldnt even consider going to church
773367 hes already in another church and doesnt care about this or that
773368 a convert needs a friend a responsibility and to be nourished by the word of god
773369 i d like to start by extending my heartfelt thanks to his royal highness prince ghazi bin muhammad of jordan president levin dean attridge miroslav volf and joseph cumming for having me here and to all of you who have made the journey to yale to tackle such a timely essential and challenging topic
773370 for we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon us
773371 in everything do to others what you would have them do to you for this sums up the law and the prophets
773372 what is hateful to yourself do not do to another that is the whole of the torah the rest is commentary
773373 not one of you truly believes until you wish for others what you wish for yourself
773374 treat not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful
773375 the sum of those conditions of social life which allow social groups and their individual members relatively thorough and ready access to their own fulfillment
773376 i know youve done a lot now im going to ask you to do more
773377 oversimplified to the point of being seriously misleading which is exactly the problem with mccain s ad
773378 as recently as april 2007 obama voted in favor of funding u s troops again but this time democrats added a non binding call to withdraw them from iraq mccain who was absent for the vote urged the president to veto that funding measure because of the withdrawal language president bush did veto it and mccain applauded bushs veto based on those facts it would be literally true to say that mccain urged a veto of funding for our troops but that would be oversimplified to the point of being seriously misleading which is exactly the problem with mccain s ad
773379 we had scheduled to go we had no problem at all in leaving we always leave press and staff off
773380 and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasn t on the senate staff that triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political and the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns
773381 so rather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been considered a political controversy of some sort
773382 what we decided was that we not make a visit and instead i would call some of the troops that were there so that essentially would be the extent of the story
773383 barack obama stopped by walter reed army medical center saturday to visit wounded war veterans a group that he has said endures substandard care under the bush administration the presumed democratic nominee who was in washington to speak to the national association of latino elected and appointed officials slipped into the facility shortly after 9 a m without stopping to speak to the small group of reporters who follow him the visit wasn t on his public schedule
773384 on monday sen obama stopped into a combat support hospital in the green zone of baghdad some of you may have seen the show on hbo called baghdad er that was this hospital
773385 john mccain is an honorable man who is running an increasingly dishonorable campaign senator mccain knows full well that senator obama strongly supports and honors our troops which is what makes this attack so disingenuous senator obama was honored to meet with our men and women in uniform in iraq and afghanistan this week and has visited wounded soldiers at walter reed numerous times this politicization of our soldiers is exactly what senator obama sought to avoid and it s not worthy of senator mccain or the civil campaign he claimed he would run
773386 i was with senator obama last week as we met privately with troops in iraq and afghanistan senator obama listened to their concerns and expressed his gratitude for their service without press or fanfare he cares for our troops deeply and has worked hard to give them not only the resources they need but also honor their service with a clearly defined mission and by providing them with the support they have earned when they come home and just as senator mccains support of president bushs veto of funding for our troops doesnt mean he does not support them neither does senator obamas insistence that we not give george bush a blank check
773387 using senator obamas somber visit to israels holocaust museum yad vashem as a backdrop to score cheap political points instead of focusing on the security needs of the nation
773388 advocates an unconditional withdrawal that ignores the facts on the ground and the advice of our top military commanders
773389 whether we leave with victory and honor which is of no apparent concern to barack obama
773390 as soon as possible as far as we are concerned
773391 u s presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
773392 i had the courage and the judgment to say i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
773393 if kensukes hand is broken i am going to kill someone

773405 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart

773419 we have now learned that 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006 not 40 000 that had been previously cited these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
773420 as president i am committed to developing a national aids strategy to decrease new hiv infections and improve health outcomes for americans living with hiv aids
773421 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
773422 the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc yesterday announced that in 2006 there were 56 300 new hiv infections in united states significantly higher than the previous estimate of 40 000 cases more than a million americans live with this devastating disease as president i will work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
773423 you know every once in a while we see barack obama playing basketball
773424 well the point of this ad is energy policy is a serious deficiency in this country vis a vis an energy policy weve been waiting 20 or 30 years to get one john mccain has suggested that we have an all above approach lets talk nuclear lets talk drilling lets talk biofuels lets talk biofuels in a way thats smart and doesnt disrupt the agricultural community but lets get it all on the table and senator obama said no nuclear no drilling
773425 he seems open to drilling right now as part of a comprehensive package
773426 well now he said that in the morning and later on in the afternoon he clarified his position he said i am opposed to drilling he is opposed to drilling
773427 but he said he would accept it as a part of a comprehensive package
773428 that he clarified later in the day i mean its typical you know every once in a while we see him playing basketball and hes obviously a pretty good athlete and probably has a pretty good head fake so the head fake is well ill deal with a compromise but later on depending on the audience too hes saying i dont favor drilling and he doesnt favor nuclear so at the end of the day you say to yourself this is a competitive issue short term and long term at the end of the day i think members of both parties are moving closer and closer to senator mccains position by saying look we need to put it all on the table lets figure it out we need both a short and long term energy policy and by the way the windfall profits tax that senator obama feels is pretty popular politically popular doesnt reduce the price at the pump doesnt reduce our dependency on foreign oil and doesnt increase produ ction so that ad was about energy and lets get serious lets recognize who he is very charismatic gives great speeches but its substance time ninety days left to go lets talk issues

773469 individuals can positively affect their credit scores in as little as three weeks
773470 its just a matter of getting educated and focused on the best fastest and most reliable course of action
773471 when no limit is reported credit scoring software presumes the account is maxed out
773472 rather than carrying a large balance in an unfavorable tier redistribute outstanding balances over several credit cards
773473 closing credit card accounts can hurt your score unless the accounts were opened less than two years ago and you have over six credit cards
773474 contact the creditors that report late payments and request a good faith adjustment that removes the late payments reported on your account
773475 charge offs and liens that are older than 24 months do not affect your credit score nearly as much as ones under 24 months
773476 but if theyre newer than 24 months they can seriously damage your credit

773587 this is a political case in which efforts are being made to stop the old man becoming the president of the country
773588 throughout the investigation and prosecution of this case the anc president has had his rights repeatedly violated by institutions of state specifically the national prosecuting authority npa
773589 he has been subjected to a vicious and unrelenting trial by media having been found guilty long before his case has even come to court
773590 until such time as a court tells us otherwise jacob zuma is an innocent person
773591 that is why the anc has supported him until now and will continue to support him

773774 well doug died you remember doug right he worked for the fire department he had an inoperable brain tumor and died yesterday
773775 yeah it was pretty sad the fire department saluted his coffin and everything speaking of which the fire chief from the neighboring city was just killed too
773776 well i guess that he got crushed between a moving fire truck and a wall poor guy he was one week from retirement like 80 years old or something
773777 stop that oh i quit my job at the post office last week
773778 damn i cant believe that you tried to tell me that nothing was going on around there
773779 yup i quit last week but i stuck around a little longer because my bosss step sister died
773780 yeah i guess she had leg surgery and shortly after just tipped over and died just like that
773781 yeah but listen to this a week later my boss calls me again and asks if i can stick around a little longer because her step brother died too
773782 mmm hmm i guess he had a heart attack while his family was getting him lunch at the deli they called him to ask what he wanted on his sandwich and he didnt answer guy was already dead
773783 nope i guess they found him right in the middle of the lawn she lost three family members in three weeks
773784 well you know what they say about death in threes or fives
773785 so yeah ill be working at the post office a little while longer while she straightens everything out but then im going to start full time at the other company
773786 yeah tell me about that place are you going to get benefits and everything
773787 yes but i cant meet with my new boss because hes out of town right now his dad died
773788 yeah his dad died of a heart attack i guess hes had a condition for a long time and theyve been treating it with some expensive experimental procedure
773789 well every few months they send a huge amount of his blood to india
773790 yeah they send a bunch of his blood to india and doctors there pump it full of these stem cells and send it back
773791 i didnt think so either i guess it costs 30 000 a pop and theyve done it at least three times
773792 so yeah but get this the surgery required to get the stem cell infused blood back into his system is currently illegal in the united states so they have to fly him out to the dominican republic for the treatment
773793 that cant possibly be safe under any circumstances do they know exactly what the indian doctors are putting in the blood
773794 i have to be honest with you that sounds like a really terrible idea
773795 well it must have been because the most recent time they did it he got sick on the operating table and died
773796 it really couldnt have ended any other way how do you even make contacts with people to assist with such an insane thing did they even bother talking to american doctors about safer treatments
773797 i doubt it theyre a rich family and do weird things hes dead now
773798 well mom i have to say that this is a new record for you weve been talking for 10 minutes now and youve achieved a body count of no less than six people

773816 i didnt really understand the emotional worth of that line until i became a living example of it chances are that i was going to push celia away before even saying hello to her which was my style at the time
773817 i honestly cant remember how she answered but it didnt matter
773818 hey i wanted to let you know that i broke up with
773819 no there wasnt any blood yes thats what i figured i just wanted to be safe so is there anything specific we should be looking for besides blood
773820 because he was asking such funny questions and acting awkward i was thinking that there was a big possibility that j was going to be coming what was throwing me off was this birthday party for her dad
773821 he knew he would have me for at least a few minutes
773822 that could be a little awkward for her sitting downstairs if you didnt know anyways yeah
773823 he would have me for at least a few minutes
773824 i would find more franks and let each of their subscribers know that its an option

773831 i have not a fault to find with her person
773832 i think her all you describe i love to look at her and i will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain considering how handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way
773833 where there is a disposition to dislike a motive will never be wanting
773834 there is something about him that rather interests me a sort of sauciness he may be an agreable sic flirt there is exquisite pleasure in subduing an insolent spirit in making a person pre determined to dislike acknowledge ones superiority

773836 i have never yet found that the advice of a sister could prevent a young mans being in love if he chose it
773837 only one comes back with me tomorrow probably miss eliza amp i rather dread it we shall not have two ideas in common she is young pretty chattering amp thinking chiefly i presume of dress company amp admiration
773838 where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred times
773839 i cannot easily resolve on anything so serious as marriage especially as i am not at present in want of money
773840 i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good
773841 miss blachford is married but i have never seen it in the papers and one may as well be single if the wedding is not to be in print

773845 no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved

773850 emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through and very good lists they were very well chosen and very neatly arranged sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule the list she drew up when only fourteen i remember thinking it did her judgement so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma she will never submit to anything requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding

773857 the apostle paul and the introspective conscience of the west
773858 cults and cosmic consciousness religious vision in the american 1960s
773859 some of these reviewers seem to be surprised that he can produce work like this
773860 paul is a talented songwriter hes got a force of nature behind him he will carry on regardless
773861 he is still creating music thats getting people talking it is testimony to his talent hes like a bob dylan or van morrison
773862 he will never put out a really awful record he knows how to write a good song he knows what works
773863 out of all the punk scene he is the one that has proved himself who would have thought he would be the one he has an obsession with music
773864 you could never imagine bruce foxton and rick buckler from the jam allowing music to dominate their lives in the way it has shaped pauls life
773865 he would literally change his life around a record like he did with the style council
773866 paul has always concentrated on the music not the lifestyle which is why he has lasted so long
773867 im not surprised not to hear from him paul makes his mind up and moves on
773868 i saw it as a book about music exploring how paul behaves
773869 i knew people would say you were just slagging him because you dont like him
773870 i didnt have bitterness if anything it was written quite calmly but i believe emotion makes for powerful writing
773871 they saw what i was trying to do the structure of it was to build a portrait of the man around the records
773872 the content is so unique because we were so close
773873 i had about three or four nasty emails from the paul weller hardcore
773874 even if he went on a killing spree these people would say he was right
773875 but some of them made some good points we had a good dialogue
773876 my book paints him not as a good person or a bad person but as a person
773877 paul can be the devil and then an angel he can be really spot on but equally he can be quite difficult
773878 if you look at dylan or van morrison you can imagine them having the same lifestyle hes a mystic poet wrapped up in a hooligans coat
773879 he can be effing and blinding and then come out with these beautiful songs about rustic scenes

773908 were not going to miss a beat with joe in there
773909 i think that there may have been a few miscommunications involved
773910 i think it was the right thing for the board to reconsider the issues that the people had and to restart the process
773911 i know one of the issues that i found through the student government was that over at the damon city campus theres no registered medical staff
773912 thats something that has been a concern to me and is something id like to look into a little bit deeper
773913 its great to see the college offer an opportunity to the students not many secondary college students can say theyve sat on a board of directors or a board of trustees

773924 create a new even lonelier atmosphere for jon arbuckle jons observations seem to teeter between existential crisis and deep despair
773925 i want to thank dan for enabling me to see another side of garfield some of the strips he chose were slappers oh i could have left that out it would have been funnier
773926 when i looked at jon and laughed at his crazy antics i thought hes just like me as it turns out i wasnt the only one saw myself in him millions of visitors from all over the world visit garfield minus garfield and tell me they think the same thing now thanks to the awesome generosity and humor of jim davis garfield minus garfield is going to become a book and im absolutely honored to be part of it

773930 it was a great team effort everybody contributed i had faith in the boys to bounce back
773931 there is a lot of quality in the side the way our openers got us off to brilliant starts helped us control the match
773932 harbhajan ishant and zak bowled brilliantly and that sealed the match for us
773933 yes there are a few areas we need to work out and hopefully the boys would have sorted them out by the time we start off for the last test
773934 it is a good system but there are some areas that have to be looked into hopefully after the series we will sit with the officials and sort out the areas that need to be brushed up
773935 india played really good cricket their bowlers constantly kept the pressure on us and their openers were brilliant
773936 indias new ball bowlers got them wickets which is extermely crucial in any form of the game
773937 we need to figure out a few things and come back strongly 307 for instance was a good score for us to get on this wicket and we should have got them
773938 our bowlers constantly kept us in the hunt but it was the batting that did us in
773939 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad
773940 i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states

773957 french people act the same when we are on vacation
773958 oh weve been doing this for years we dont mind as long as they arent being drunk or violent its funny for us
773959 ask the lady in the white shirt if she could translate the menu for you
773960 it will not work for the first barrel that comes down
773961 you want to take a swipe at me dont you
773962 there have been students who through this process have left the university
773963 it doesnt necessarily mean that its safer but i know we have identified people who may have posed a threat
773964 i think universities are seeing more clearly that you cant have an institution devoted to the life of the mind without attending to the health of the mind
773965 essentially every campus has a threat assessment team in place at this point in one way or another
773966 many of these were in place prior to the more recent violent tragedies on various campuses but they have been formalised and put in place almost everywhere that lacked such a system
773967 there arent really profiles of students prone to violence or suicide but there are characteristics you can look at depression suspiciousness grandiosity social isolation
773968 another thing you might see is fantasies of revenge thats a key piece of the motivation of such people the sense of being an avenging angel its rare but sometimes people with paranoid psychoses kill in what they think is self defence
773969 in an instance where you know someone has been violent you can find these things but you can also find all these things in people who 99 9 per cent of the time are not going to be violent
773970 faculty are trained to do research and teach not to be psychologists
773971 but post virginia tech yeah that made it harder to think this is not part of my job were all in this together
773972 also never ever borrow against your 401k plan because you will pay double taxation on the money you borrow because you dont pay taxes on the money you put into a 401k when you pay back the loan which you must do within five years or 15 years if used to buy a home you pay it back with money you have paid taxes on then when you retire and take the money out again you end up paying taxes on it a second time
773973 three men went into a hotel the manager said the room was 30 so each man paid 10 a while later the manager realized the room was only 25 so he sent the bellboy to the 3 guys room with 5 the bellboy only gave each man 1 back and kept the other 2 for himself now 3 men paid 9 each for the room which is 27 add the 2 that the bellboy kept and thats 29 but the 3 men paid 30 originally where is the other dollar
773974 another potential pitfall is that some employers do not allow contribution while you have an active loan this essentially wipe out your ability to get the matching contribution
773975 there are some traditional highly skilled areas of craft production that the generation applying for higher education dont really have in mind when applying
773976 theyre not listed as higher education funding council for england endangered subjects but they are endangered in terms of peoples understanding of some of these craft skills
773977 a very difficult decision in terms of the role of an institution such as this is how much we should do to protect some of these traditional areas even though they may not be areas that students particularly want to engage in how much do we respond to market driven recruitment and how much do we have a role to foster subject areas and skills
773978 basically you dont have to know how to use dyes and weave to design for woven textiles because you can do it on a computer
773979 what i worry about is that by the time that we see whats happened the loss of core art and design skills teaching it may be too late
773980 all of the big making areas that art and design has grown up around are areas in which were starting to see changes
773981 theres not exactly a falling out of favour we still take on 60 or 70 students a year as we are seen as a centre for this type of work but we are watching it very carefully because of the changes that have happened with schools
773982 when you go into schools you see the children being offered a completely different experience theyre making their choices based on what they bring with them from school they are less aware of the learning by making options that are offered in an art school environment
773983 were seeing students coming in with different types of skills
773984 we perhaps need to move more quickly and be more flexible in terms of moving between specialisms
773985 in the north west were the only institution that offers ceramics i think its going to come down to what the region can provide
773986 i have so many people applying for the places i offer
773987 its a growth area but its a direct response not only to a vocational need but also to a growing discipline
773988 the art world is probably many many times larger than it ever was there are more artists coming into the world there are more galleries being established there is infinitely more money involved so theres an art world out there thats just generating huge amounts of income and it needs servicing
773989 because its an art department you become very aware of its delivery costs compared with the others arts students are very expensive
773990 my programme is a very cheap programme to run its very profitable in comparison
773991 id love it to go into my course but the environment in which my students are working needs to be a thriving healthy expensive art environment id say thats an integral part of my students education every day they have to negotiate and encounter the reality of art students making art i dont even think of myself as supporting or subsidising certain programmes are just expensive to deliver if they are expensive to deliver they must still be delivered
773992 the irony is that one of our most famous artists today grayson perry is a potter but it hasnt resulted in popularity for the discipline of ceramics
773993 the last thing someones going to do is try to move into a minority craft or restrict themselves
773994 im torn between saying that we should preserve these specialist skills and turning around and looking at what young artists want to be doing the art world moves on if artists today want to make something in ceramics they have no qualms about asking someone else to do it its one thing to say that its our responsibility to preserve these skills but its another thing if students dont want to go and do them
773995 i think this notion of unpopular subjects being under threat isnt new i remember a time when you went to art school and you studied painting sculpture and printmaking sculpture came under threat a long long time ago so fine art courses came into being where students can study across disciplines sculpture hasnt died though i can remember there was a lot of comment in the late 1960s and early 1970s about the end of sculpture its changed it has survived
773996 thats something that our world competitors are extremely envious of our ability to produce these highly adaptable and creative students
773997 these skills have not disappeared theyve just moved elsewhere fine art is in a certain sense of crisis nationally in a funny sort of way its lost its raison detre it used to be the central subject not any more its moved to the edge and it is design activities that have moved to the centre
773998 you put together skills learnt from craft based activities with the new and you end up with something where craft can reinvent itself
773999 looking for some sort of golden age that never actually existed is an exercise in nostalgia that im not very interested in looking around the degree shows there are fantastic skills here theyre just different skills
774000 thats definitely what i think has made a big change over the years if you offer work placement then thats a big advantage for getting students involved with the industry there is a big influence now since top up fees of parents being interested theyre probably steering students towards things such as industry accreditation of courses
774001 thats very successful what youre offering is something very attractive because the students like games but also because there is a real prospect of employability
774002 we have found that potential students and pupils dont necessarily understand what the opportunities are
774003 that tends to conjure up a traditional way of thinking
774004 how do we turn it around how do we increase demand and relevance
774005 people presume that art and design is very digital or going even more digital of course it is but in a way thats just another tool its not replacing its adding
774006 we have digital technology but we still make a hell of a lot part of the function of art and design in society is to make things that people live with use and look at
774007 because of who we are in the sector were able to provide support for some of those more vulnerable subjects
774008 we should be in a sufficiently strong position to protect a few of these areas and look at them in a more imaginative and frankly sexier way that attracts a younger market
774009 things move in and out of vulnerability experience tells us the pendulum always swings
774010 from being a fairly purist academic environment to a more entrepreneurial one
774011 we are looking at how as a specialised institution we can develop partnerships with other institutions in order to bring together art and design with science art and design with business and management for example
774012 you cant stand still you need to reposition the subjects with relevance to a global context in the process of doing that you are actually protecting the practice in some way
774013 at the moment there is still a lack of understanding about art and design as a professional career its still slightly treated that if youre not academic enough to do the science subjects you do art and design
774014 there is also a lack of real understanding about the different options in art and design even students going into higher education will probably mostly think theyre going to be creative designers they wont know about other options
774015 what were trying to do is make a stronger connection between professional practice and education and help schools include things that are closely related to practice in their schoolrooms so we address the issue of career pathways and progression
774016 it really is about getting the industry to think about its own skills development working more closely with the universities to do that
774017 if we dont develop and maintain our design education at all levels we will run the risk of dropping down the league
774018 its about pushing towards the creative economy how we as a country protect support and maintain our leading position on developing creativity
774019 we suggest that a blowout in the banjar panji 1 well was the most likely mechanism for triggering the lusi eruption
774020 dams are the most dangerous man made structure likely to cause quake
774021 in truth it was probably a bad idea for the scientists to be cloud seeding while a storm was building
774022 but mans ability to modify the weather in some small measure can in no way match power of nature
774023 cloud seeders often have the opposite problem they dont know whether theyve had an effect at all
774024 the evolution of the atmosphere is very sensitive to small perturbations
774025 if there is an 80 chance a storm is going to hit miami and if diverting it creates a 10 chance it will hit bermuda what do you do
774026 in my view it is inevitable that it will be tried but that may not be in our lifetime
774027 climate change is a non problem the right answer to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
774028 they should all be sent to live on a small pacific island about 3 feet above sea level
774029 weve already answered that objection since god exists miracles are possible
774030 because they were superstitious underprivileged and gullible and wanted to be part of something big and important
774031 but is calling the rose bowl par for the season really reasonable i think some people forget that there is a difference between goals and expectations every year our goal for the team should be national championship rose bowl or another bcs bowl in that order but our expectations have to be tempered to the realities of the teams situation

774360 la catalogazione delle impronte serve a tutela dei bambini stessi molti sono privi di identit e non dimentichiamo che adulti senza scrupoli li utilizzano per commettere reati

774368 deemed sexually promiscuous video vixens not worthy of consideration if other black women speak up were considered angry black women who complain this society cant even see a woman like michelle obama all it sees is a black woman and attaches stereotypes
774369 in my profession white men mentor young whites on how to succeed
774370 theyre either indifferent to or dogmatically document the mistakes black women make their indifference is the worst because it means were invisible
774371 weve perfected it because weve been doing it for so long but people dont appreciate the skill it requires and they dont recognize the toll it takes on us as human beings
774372 i think one of the most interesting things about michelle obama is that what she and her husband are doing is pretty revolutionary these days and i dont mean running for president for a black man and woman in the u s to be happily married with children and working as partners to build a life let alone a life of service to others all while rearing their children together is downright revolutionary
774373 for all the weighty material mr obama had a disarming touch he did not belittle students instead he drew them out restating and polishing halting answers students recall in one class on race he imitated the way clueless white people talked why are your friends at the housing projects shooting each other
774374 on the national level bipartisanship usually means democrats ignore the needs of the poor and abandon the idea that government can play a role in issues of poverty race discrimination sex discrimination or environmental protection

774384 we have a drive to connect and socialize this drive has now been accelerated and amplified as comprehensively as the steam engine amplified human strength two hundred and fifty years ago just as the steam engine initiated the transformation of the natural landscape into man made artifice the hyperconnectivity engendered by these new toys is transforming the human landscape of social relations
774385 no its not about young blokes with no social life
774386 oh man the record companies will be lining up to sign me

774390 their stock peaked at x and now it is at 70 of x so if someone offers them 110 of current price they should sell

774392 this 3 day workshop includes a step by step guide and work plan to achieve a workable architecture in less than 8 weeks
774393 just as many forecasters and markets were too optimistic in 2005 07 effectively running with the view that whatever china could do india could do better there are now some that are suggesting that it can do nothing right
774394 many clients have often regarded this projection as a fact
774395 given the inflation challenge the fiscal and current account position one might say oil prices are the most critical thing for india in the next six months or so
774396 things are going to get much worse yet the situation in europe will follow the us
774397 my belief is that if within a month or two there isnt something transforming in the works the major shareholders will put enough pressure on the company that mr yang will be forced out
774398 looking around at an ink and newsprint tableau that could have come out of a 1930s movie or 1950s sitcom i suddenly wondered why arent we all online surfing the net
774399 what is it in our collective dna that makes us want to sip our coffee turn a page look up from a story say
774400 at that moment all the endless obituaries ive read about the death of newspapers struck me as rather ludicrous or at the least extremely premature until those of us who came of age before the internet all die off there will be a market for print versions of newspapers
774401 its one of the reasons two new companies newspaperdirect and satellite newspapers have come up with remarkable systems that make it possible for you to print a full sized edition of as many different papers as you like
774402 so there we were overlooking the caribbean and every morning we were able to order up hard copies of the latest edition of a huge selection of papers including the new york times the london times the washington post the financial times even i admit the new york post a guilty pleasure
774403 still want to treat themselves to what is an affordable luxury
774404 their stores are the same as they were five years ago resting on your laurels is a sure way to allowing someone else to get a slice of your pie
774405 if they can stop the bleeding they could get healthy in a hurry
774406 when starbucks caff nero and costa launched here people were just happy to get a cappuccino now the average punter can tell the difference between a starbucks coffee and a nero coffee their palates have become more sophisticated
774407 coffee doesnt have to be strong to be good it must be crisp and clean not bittery the skill of the barista is also in providing a properly textured milk theres an art to it

774424 this unique announcement comes at an exciting time for secerno we have just secured funding that allows us to respond to market opportunities and customer demand
774425 in this case we are bringing secerno to a virtualised environment to offer organisations more variety in their deployments and reduce their overall costs in terms of resources and expenses virtualisation is emerging as a key strategy for companies and we are delighted to be the first to offer this option for database activity monitoring and blocking
774426 we can and should do more to verify that the application that is connecting to the database not only has appropriate credentials but appropriate usage this becomes even more important in a virtualised environment where some of the underlying network assumptions are thrown out the window
774427 with the growing trend towards virtualisation we expect that database activity monitoring and prevention capabilities in a virtualised environment will become a growing requirement for organisations world wide
774428 we are really at the situation where all parties are agreed that edf would be the best purchaser of be it is the best and most straightforward way of getting the nuclear new build that we are looking for
774429 you dont stand back totally when you have a 36 per cent stake
774430 we have to guard against the persistence of inflation and a little more action now could mean we are all better off in the end
774431 the mistake we could make and we are all worried about this is of holding policy too tight and the economy weakening more than is necessary to get inflation back to target
774432 we found that singapore and the singaporeans were much more accommodating investors than they are in the uk
774433 theres plenty of work absolutely masses i cant think of any one of our practice areas in the middle east that is quiet
774434 not everyones happy to leave family behind but there are professional issues too particularly for more junior lawyers firms may deny it but many of the deals being done in the middle east are on the back of an envelope they are not of the same quality as deals being put together in london
774435 a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months
774436 i do not think that the headwinds have diminished if anything i think that they are picking up a little
774437 corporate governance is so much better in the gulf in russia it was all about fraud we have never seen anything like that in the middle east
774438 if my experience is anything to go by bps problems are only just beginning they bp should fight back use everything they have its the only thing that these people understand
774439 he decided to issue shares to a group of insiders including himself i had to go into battle to prevent it being diluted
774440 i took all my savings 4 000 and applied for all the privatisations and made ten times my money

774448 you want to be off the financial grid it will take a long time to work this through and all the places that have easy access to financial markets are going to be hurt the companies in the middle east have been off the grid
774449 over the next 12 months there will be a significant revaluation of pegged currencies it will be the opposite of 1997

774454 i am coming to trust twitter as my personal search tool more than any of these others and heres why i can consider the recommender much of the information comes from people i already know and have chatted with online most of the rest comes from people i can check out very quickly and draw some sort of conclusion on whether i should take their word on a restaurant hotel or book
774455 most people try out twitter and dont get it they tweet what theyre doing and find that nobody is listening
774456 theres a reason for this the value of social media sites is proportional to the size and quality of your network the people that build a large network on twitter are going to get results like israel most people though probably wont see the twitter that israel and new media gurus see
774457 the social media divide also represents a great opportunity if social media sites like twitter can find ways to reproduce the type of experience that social networking gurus have and can bring this experience to a broad audience the sites value will increase exponentially
774458 it probably isnt what most people are expecting from me
774459 we toured with disturbed before but the production was a little more scaled down then compared to this so seeing them in that set up to me theyre stealing the festival man i love it i hate to say it but theyre handing even slipknot their ass

774464 some people are great songwriters without having to work on it or stew over it or mull over it
774465 it would be great to be one of them but im not i do have to do some work on them youd think working within a tight rhyme scheme would help narrow down the possibilities but it an infinite number of ways to phrase something if youre backed into a corner with a certain figure of speech theres always another one that seems like itll work just as well except with a different set of nuances for me writing is more about choosing a strong figure of speech than fitting words into a pattern if im attached to a certain image i find that helps the song flow into the next verse from point a to point b
774466 i certainly lost nothing by going indie as opposed to staying on a major label
774467 but going the indie route isnt for everyone and you need a not sitting there poring over budgets and making calls to retailers to make sure the records are getting to the stores being independent is not something you can do on your own the big problem for me is the public perception of downloading and burning cds as an alternative to paying for music its decimated the entire music industry but id say that indie record labels have been hit harder than the majors
774468 even when i was on major labels i tried to be involved with the packaging
774469 of course there you have to fight just to get access to the art director they dont want you involved that way my father is in advertising so i guess it runs in the family
774470 its a street in a town where winning isnt sweet and every win is the beginning of defeat
774471 fucking smilers thats a phrase a friend of mine and i started using after coming across it in a newsgroup called alt bitter

774600 intelligent dialogue on important issues that are facing this country
774601 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
774602 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
774603 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
774604 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
774605 she had no criminal history nor did she have any known personal reasons to run away from home she left a hot meal uneaten on the table and did not take any possessions with her
774606 it is as though she simply disappeared off the face of the earth
774607 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
774608 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
774609 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
774610 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
774611 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
774612 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
774613 because the private health sector is going to be quite happy to provide further services for people who can pay but what about the four million who cant

774618 the aba is very disappointed that the house judiciary committee voted today to move forward with legislation that is anti competitive and interferes with the smoothly functioning electronic payment system that currently works to the benefit of consumers businesses and the broader economy
774619 mobile payments touch pay systems and other innovations will only gain traction if they offer a sustainable value proposition to all parties involved in the transaction

774623 so far not many corporates have actively started preparing themselves for sepa as for them the precise impact of sepa is not entirely clear this is probably related to the initial reluctance of banks and software providers to communicate on sepa as some of their products are still in the pilot phase

774630 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome
774631 of course there are some bishops who arent here and the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams spoke about how he intended to be in touch with them and consult with them and try and involve them in this process going forward

774641 with all the bad data the dollar sold off rather sharply and the euro jumped a full cent to trade over 1 57 for a short while but the dollar bears didnt celebrate for long as the dollar sharply reversed course as crude oil prices rode to its rescue as i explained earlier in the week the price of crude oil and the us have had a very tight relationship lately with a correlation of 9 just after the dollar fell due to the gdp releases crude oil began a sharp 3 drop and saved the us from further losses the price of oil has continued to slide and is now down over 11 in the past month this has helped prop the dollar up in spite of a number of poor economic reports here in the us
774642 if xom and cvx fail then the us government is already dead

774663 it is hard to deal with an alcoholic but most experts would agree that the answer is not to leave your credit card behind the bar persuade the pub landlord to stay open till dawn and leave the inebriate to get on with it sadly that is how the american congress in its new housing bill is treating those troubled mortgage groups fannie mae and freddie mac

774671 july was a very tough month for commodities and commodity stocks the s amp p natural resources index fell off 15 percent the worst monthly sell off in the sector since august 1998 when the russian currency crisis triggered the implosion of the hedge fund long term capital management prices for the underlying commodities also suffered in july with the jefferies crb index down 10 1 percent this was just short of the worst monthly performance for this index since 1970
774672 china and other emerging economies have massive u s dollar surpluses and these countries are committed to infrastructure spending this week china s government announced that it will focus more on sustainable growth than worry about inflation this is significant
774673 the fundamentals for gold have not changed and with negative real interest rates in the u s this is a good time to maintain exposure to gold investments as you can clearly see from the chart below july and august generally mark a low time for gold before prices climb with the arrival of the fall buying season which is another reason to consider gold now
774674 in july energy stocks represented by the s amp p 500 energy index moved from two standard deviations above the mean to two standard deviations below the mean in just 20 trading days we think this extreme pullback offers patient investors a window of opportunity many market pundits have predicted the demise of high crude oil prices after a peak near 150 a barrel but with numerous energy stocks already trading at levels not seen since crude was under 100 we maintain that much of this forecasted price adjustment is already reflected in energy stock valuations it appears based on valuation metrics that oil stocks are priced as if oil were selling at 70 a barrel moreover unlike other bull markets where equities traded at challenging valuations energy and resource stocks are historically cheap price to earnings ratios are well below the broader market and these companies have tangible assets that are unaffected by mortgage write downs
774675 i will place an asterisk on those posts if you like

774679 questo tempo buono come tutti gli altri solo se impariamo cosa farne
774680 il mondo in lutto per un profeta ma io ho perso mio marito e lho avuto solo per cos breve tempo
774681 al tempo che arrivammo a cantare lultimo versetto disse sorella lee una meravigliosa sicurezza era entrata in me ero in pace il consolatore era venuto tutto sarebbe andato bene
774682 cercate di sapere che il padre celeste e il signore ges cristo vivono e ci sostengono
774683 e noi li metteremo alla prova l per vedere se faranno tutte le cose che dio comander loro
774684 riprendere le stanghe del mio carretto e ripartire verso ovest
774685 oh dio caro padre celeste aiutami aiutami a sopportare questa tragedia terribile la tua volont sia fatta
774686 circa un anno fa mia moglie ed io eravamo molto tristi nello spirito a causa dei problemi finanziari
774687 subito mi trovai in piedi in una stanza in che tempio fosse non so ma ne stavo ammirando le decorazioni avevo un sentimento di apprensione come sempre prima di un intervista
774688 ero cos sopraffatto dal potere del suo amore che non potevo far altro che stare l dove mi trovavo e piangere non avevo la forza di muovermi io lo vidi con i miei occhi spirituali lo vidi
774689 attravers la stanza venendo verso di me non vennero pronunciate parole non erano necessarie venne a me e da dietro mi circond in un abbraccio amorevole non dimenticher mai il tocco delle sue braccia intorno a me neppure la pressione del suo abbraccio
774690 poi il momento pass lintervista era finita mi trovai di nuovo a letto piangendo silenziosamente tra me
774691 in seguito per settimane persino un pensiero casuale a questa esperienza sacra portava lacrime ai miei e mi ricordavo del suo amore e mi sentivo di nuovo sopraffatto
774692 vorrei poter dire che le prove terribili finirono allora non accadde
774693 e sebbene il signore vi dia il pane dellavversit e lacqua dellafflizione tuttavia i tuoi insegnanti non saranno pi rimossi e i tuoi occhi vedranno coloro che ti istruiscono
774694 avevo pregato tante volte prima di questo periodo di vita miserabile
774695 potete immaginare la mia profonda gratitudine verso il mio padre celeste so che egli si cura di me
774696 dovette subire la prova fino in fondo e poi solo allora dio intervenne
774697 nessun uomo ha mai pregato col cuore senza imparare qualcosa
774698 ma due cose storte non ne fanno necessariamente una dritta in altre parole sposare luomo sbagliato semplicemente perch si era peccato con lui non necessariamente la risposta giusta al problema
774699 fu una conferma spirituale diretta e definita che egli ci apparteneva
774700 da allora non ho avuto un momento di dolore afferm jenny adesso posso camminare con le grucce dio mi ama mi ama e ascolta le preghiere
774701 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas

774710 second quarter net income rose 14 to 11 68 billion or 2 22 a share from 10 26 billion or 1 83 a share in the year ago period
774711 unfortunately prescience is one thing that the people in authority don t have we re talking about the people who are responsible for this mess and who are now in a leap of illogic the ones in charge of cleaning it up using the same easy money policies that created the mess in the first place greenspan bernanke paulson dodd the sec the banking regulators here s a word to the wise you would do very well as an investor never to listen to their musings they are politicians parading as economists as such they have an agenda and are woefully lacking in objectivity at every turn they will massage the message to what the public and the markets want to hear invariably promoting the rosy outlook and dismissing as unlikely anything bleak even if it stares them in the face their proclamations have been like clockwork always trying to sooth the markets just when the worst is about to happen investors should ignore what they have to say or even better do the exact opposite
774712 we expect the stimulus to continue to support the economy in the second half of the year
774713 we are making progress although not in a straight line housing continues to be at the heart of our economic challenges and remains our most significant downside risk
774714 while home price adjustments will continue for some time and certainly well beyond the end of the year i believe we can move through the bulk of the correction in months rather than years
774715 untenable without provoking a global depression or a nuclear attack
774716 the recency effect in psychology is a cognitive bias that results from disproportionate salience of recent stimuli or observations people tend to recall items that were at the end on a list rather than items that were in the middle on a list for example if a driver sees an equal total number of red cars as blue cars during a long journey but there happens to be a glut of red cars at the end of the journey he or she is likely to conclude that there were more red cars than blue cars throughout the drive
774717 sorry i talked you out of uaua at the close yesterday

774723 physical gold is insurance if some financial agent is holding physical gold for you in any form you have violated the insurance characteristic what you do not have in your hand or safety deposit box is not insurance
774724 you may not agree with the socialization efforts but you must certainly respect them with the election less than four months away the eyes of the world are upon our capital markets that lens isnt lost on policy makers who seemingly have two separate initiatives first they want to break the bearish credit bets currently being made by global macro hedge funds theyre attempting to do this by squeezing stocks higher through the enforcement of the short sale rule an initiative aimed at 19 select financial institutions but widely expected to soon include a broader swatch of equities
774725 what are you implying 2nd ave that the mood can change quickly from being currently negative on oil to being positive once again
774726 the second component of their master plan is crude oil with an eye toward 100 a barrel by the election

774732 as usual todays big rally in the dow is based on highly suspect data
774733 david you know sometimes it pays to get up earlier
774734 i believe the next few days are going to be key days for gold stocks just as may was a key time for the s amp p 500 and the broad market if you were following me then youll know that i took short positions against the general market back in may however i did not short at the exact top in fact i got in a little early and let the s amp p 500 go up a percent above my entry point i was convinced when i got in that the market was about to make a critical top one that would last for the rest of the year but i wasnt sure at the exact price or moment that it would come i was only certain that it was coming within a week so i decided to just start to build a position of course it worked fantastic as the market has fallen apart since then gold stocks are now in a similar critical position however instead of topping out they appear to me poised to put in a final bottom within the next five trading sessions maybe even today and it will be one that should last for the rest of the year and lead to a huge rally
774735 spot gold reversed below 950 and is consolidating between 910 and 935 failure of 910 would signal a test of primary support at 850
774736 david if youre out right now i would stay out who knows how far oil bounces

774742 one gets a little concerned when selling off state assets and budget deficits get mentioned in the same sentence
774743 if its used to close a budget gap its a one shot its doesnt help you in the long run its a fiscal gimmick
774744 the governor demonstrated that he is ready to stand up to the interest groups that will no doubt protest before the state house just as they took to the steps of city hall earlier this year
774745 home prices in stockton ca are down 40 in daytona fl houses are priced at 30 discounts with amenities the inland empire of california you name your price thats how the madness ends with huge price cuts the way it ended in bradenton fl and believe me we get more fannie mae money fnm commentary cramers take forget these darned covered bonds lets just solve the problem you get buyers after a year and a half that buyers went on strike remember while we cant live in stocks we know they trade like houses and when the first stocks to go down bottom the others are not far behind with the new housing bill the rate of foreclosures will go down and the bargains will be quite evident for those who want to take them either a new administration will remove the fear of the illegal immigrants from buying homes they were a huge part of the hard hit arizona florida and california markets or the dramatic decline in inventory at the home building level has given us breathing room it is all coming together just when no one sees it coming because you have to look at the hard hit regions to know whats going on this morning the wall street journal noted that more clarity on merrills mer commentary cramers take arrangement with lone star is needed and speculates whether lone star is going to renege on this deal and whether this is not a fair arms length deal i say give me a break these mortgages if held with a private company with a servicing arm that is in the subprime business accredited home lending and has assumptions and models for this time would not have bid if it didnt want them i think the loan is fine more importantly if the homes are down 50 and you are buying mortgages that somehow we dont even know relate to those homes you can figure you can buy them for 20 cents on the dollar and flip them for 50 cents on the dollar if you can work out the financing and lone star can this deal works because of depressed markets like stockton and daytona and the inland empire not because of the financing you have to pay attention to the real markets not the wall street markets if this stuff is going to be successful and i think it will at these prices i continue to think that merrill was a game changer and that things look brighter now everyday

774934 maybe the new city can adopt the fig tree as its city tree and encourage citizens to plant them
774935 the new city is not going to spend money to provide citizens with fig trees

774938 we need to set up a non profit people pay a nominal fee for the trees

774966 i guess its up to meg the beatles did it quite touring but continued as a band im joking but if we didnt ever tour again it wouldnt matter to me
774967 there are so many different aspects to being creative that it doesnt matter if one component is changed its been changing all the time since the band started
774968 if something touring isnt working for you and its detrimental to you then you have to figure out a new way to attack it a new way to look at it i think thats what megs doing

774981 first of all i dont think taking action on climate change is going to have that much of an impact on the economy overall second of all if you dont do it you can be sure that the economy will go down the drain in the next 30 years what may happen to the dollar and what may happen to growth in china or whatever pale into insignificance compared with the question of what happens to this planet over the next 30 or 40 years if no action is taken

775003 the briefing was based on poor research and the objective was a joke but ferguson scored a lot of points with his presentation
775004 be sure to use these buzzwords the boss loves them
775005 our guest speakers topic is management lessons from the animal world by the end of the presentation youll know whether youre a tiger a wolf or an eagle
775006 mary and ed are the top contenders for the promotion they just look the part
775007 and just think matt not only did she win a silver medal but she won it just four months after the death of her favorite aunt tilley who bought her her first pair of running shoes
775008 assuming we could reach agreement on the revenue side a big assumption we would definitely want line item allocations and some way to guarantee that dollars allocated are actually spent
775009 so i think we continue to be on a very steep uphill climb
775010 the lottery was originally sold as a way to help education so buying a losing lottery ticket still helped the kids take away education and people may feel theyve been bamboozled

775020 you move from first trying to make something and showing it to a few friends and then you start getting to know some people online and you might get it uploaded to the organisation or you could enter a competition when you decide to go to a big convention and meet other amv creators then thats another level its at the big amv conventions that we get to talk about each others video and thats when you realise that the videos are actually conversations amongst the amv creators you wouldnt just know that just from downloading the videos the videos are a result of conversations that editors are having through a lot of private channels like at conventions or on im
775021 i think a lot of americans dont know a lot about barack obama and legitimately the republican national committee is getting the information out
775022 theres nothing new here its stuff people have known for a long time probably some information in there they dont want to be on the web
775023 apparently john mccain picked up on the internet about as quickly as he picked up on the fact that the economy is going south and the war in iraq is a complete blunder
775024 theyre trying to throw everything they can against the wall and see what sticks
775025 what theyre trying to do is an overall strategy to make obama look like another chicago politician though somewhat different in who he is but not what he is
775026 its always been seen as a place thats been more open and friendly to immigrants
775027 this particular announcement is a further step in making immigrants feel that their rights are going to be protected
775028 finally because we are opposed to discrimination we reject preferences quotas and set asides based on skin color ethnicity or gender which perpetuate divisions and can lead people to question the accomplishments of successful minorities and women
775029 i would push for federal action to carry out a federal responsibility and a federal responsibility is immigration if you have secure borders and you have a temporary worker program that has to do with tamper proof biometric documents you address the issue of the 12 million people who are here illegally and you dont have to worry about all that
775030 a company that actively demonstrates its commitment to the gay and lesbian community
775031 on saturday cook county will hold its first medicine collection drive in the south suburb of midlothian joining will kendall and other counties in the chicago region in providing a safe way for residents to toss out their old prescription drugs
775032 chicago officials reacted swiftly in april after testing performed for the chicago tribune showed trace amounts of many common household medicines in the water supply which serves 7 million people in the city and suburbs
775033 finally because we are opposed to discrimination we reject preferences quotas and set asides based on skin color ethnicity or gender which perpetuate divisions and can lead people to question the accomplishments of successful minorities and women
775034 theres no question that mainstream journalists completely adore mccain and cover him favorably
775035 now it is you cannot do what we do routinely and have been doing for a century
775036 you have been writing favorable stories about president bush for eight years this is a serious problem and one of the reasons why this organization was founded

775041 further examines the security and authentication overhead issue and found only a 5 5 overhead to tcp vs udp their summary includes the comment

775043 does anybody know what is the max length of this attribute i did not find this information in the documentation just tried to set different rcc sip uris msrtcsip lineserver through active directory users and computers snap in and received that in some cases the maximum length is 211 characters but in other cases it is more than this number can anyone advise me on this attribute
775044 it is not encrypted so you cant ensure end to end security of sip messages
775045 udp has a fundamental flaw for large sip messages the size of the udp datagram is limited to 1500 bytes
775046 while it is true that ocs does not comply with rfc 3261 by not offering or accepting udp the assumption that all sip messages will exceed the udp datagram size limit provides an implied waiver on this requirement

775088 illinois has no restrictions on who can give or how much anyone can contribute to campaigns but the law does require candidates to tell the public the amounts and sources of their campaign money and details of how it is spent
775089 it is a weak system that has been made even weaker by a history of timid oversight by state authorities
775090 house bill 824 now sitting on the governors desk would ban businesses with state contracts from making campaign contributions to the officeholder awarding the contract
775091 the governor should sign hb 824 and give the public some confidence the billions of dollars in news spending would be done fairly and would not be directed at the wallets of the businesses contributing to his campaign fund
775092 the governor claims he wants billions in new infrastructure spending to create jobs and to guard against a bridge collapse as happened in minneapolis last year
775093 but after years of headlines about contracts that look more like pay to play than legitimate state business taxpayers have to wonder whether his top concern is bridge safety or building up his campaign treasury

775187 but catholics who support pro choice candidates also need a compelling proportionate reason to justify it what is a proportionate reason when it comes to the abortion issue its the kind of reason we will be able to explain with a clean heart to the victims of abortion when we meet them face to face in the next life which we most certainly will if were confident that these victims will accept our motives as something more than an alibi then we can proceed
775188 i cant name any pro choice catholic politician who has been active in a sustained public way in trying to discourage abortion and to protect unborn human life not one
775189 only in circumstances that are extraordinarily hard to contemplate may a catholic voter support a proponent of so great an intrinsic moral evil
775190 changing the views of pro choice candidates takes a lot more than verbal gymnastics good alibis and pious talk about personal opposition to killing unborn children im sure roman catholics for obama know that and i wish them good luck theyll need it
775191 its exciting and were a little nervous at the same time
775192 were going to face good pitchers and good players but were ready for it
775193 well its never easy with all the drama but we did emerge victorious
775194 luckily it was going our way and we were able to put the ball in the net after the first goal you generally keep your cool and able to play a calmer game and thats what helped us come out on top
775195 well its kind of hard to answer that right now because i havent seen the video yet
775196 i mean it was so out of the play and in all fairness i was watching the ball the whole time
775197 i asked amado what had happened and he told me that further back field he hit me with an elbow in the chest and then he retaliated so if thats what my player is saying then i trust him the linesman is saying he didnt see anything and the ref didnt see anything so i have to look at the video before i can comment on it
775198 well toronto is a place we love to come to because we know that it going to be a great atmosphere but at the same time with the crowd out here it feels like they have an extra player on the field with them

775218 it used to be taiwan was seen as a more prosperous donor and better ally while the p r c didnt have very many resources
775219 now pacific nations are quite rightly seeing the p r c as a rising power with huge reserves and see huge economic benefit in aligning themselves with the p r c
775220 taiwan has to resort to increasingly covert methods to bribe politicians because they dont have the lure they had in the past of being more prosperous than china
775221 its in the p r c s interest to reach a compromise on international space
775222 these issues have been alienating taiwanese for a long time
775223 china has gained more leverage against taiwan in diplomatic struggles

775227 though india is not worried about beijing building a strategic naval base on hainan island in the south china sea it is concerned about the numbers nuclear submarines have long legs traversing anywhere between 7 000 15 000 kilometers it is immaterial where they are based

775264 we said you pay your own transportation you pay your own hotel we give you one meal a day and you work 10 hours a day and folks did it
775265 they found so many holes today that there wasnt much we could do
775266 hats off to them they swung the bats well today
775267 we were down on our pitching and it makes it tough when you dont have healthy arms
775268 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
775269 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
775270 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
775271 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
775272 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
775273 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
775274 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
775275 i came onto the court thinking ok its not going to be an easy match
775276 i would say i was more experienced in finals and it paid off
775277 i hit some good shots and in the crucial moments she gave me some good mistakes that i could say thank you and that helped me win in two sets
775278 its just unbelievable its a first time experience for me
775279 normally if i win a tournament the next week id always lose in the first round
775280 when i won my first match i thought ok its better than the previous times then i just took it one match at a time
775281 i was pretty nervous in my first big final and i wished i played better
775282 i wanted to have a good match against dinara in the rallies i didnt play the way i wanted i was scared to make a mistake thats why i was standing behind the baseline it was not all good today but that happens
775283 to be no 1 in the world you have to win a grand slam
775284 there you have to play your best tennis for two weeks theres so much more emotion in a grand slam i think i still have to get stronger mentally and fitness wise i just want to be healthy and take one step at a time and lets see if i ever can make it
775285 now i have enough confidence to believe in myself so we will see
775286 this was my best week ever and i really enjoyed it when you beat your idol jankovic or a player you always looked up to dementieva its something special i hope to have more weeks like this
775287 next final i will be more relaxed and not so scared about it
775288 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us

775292 the outlook for the global economy today is much worse than it was a year ago
775293 if you look at the housing sector in the united states it is obvious that there is no signs of a recovery yet
775294 asias financial exposure to the united states has also risen as a result growth has become more synchronized as has financial market performance
775295 put something in a class i want you to start typing today because we have had the problem defined for over two weeks solve the problem refactor only if you have to
775296 i disagree with the assertion that developers are largely happy with their salaries
775297 companies work hard to keep their cash and typically only invest in the risky business of software when theres a lot more money to be made
775298 why put up with rubbish wages when you can earn more in another profession
775299 1 the reason most projects fail is down to the individual developers
775300 a real large chunk of em would do a bloody good job of it too
775301 its probably about right in terms of payment vs effort
775302 as for the roi argument i have to say there is a major management problem with the companies that behave the way youve described
775303 companies that undertake software projects with no thought to profits and then overpay developers to the point that theyre fat and happy are either doomed or up to something that we dont understand
775304 the fundamental problem ive seen in most projects is management
775305 if only they didnt have to write a quick fix for the release on friday and then once thats done theres another quick fix and another
775306 is there mediocrity at work in software development sure you bet same goes for management sales and just about any other job field you want to look at
775307 how many people die each year due to mistakes made by physicians pharmicists
775308 complaining about it is about as effective as complaining about gravity
775309 it is obvious you havent worked in the industry for very long
775310 the incompetent programmers move on to become managers of some sort
775311 if you would run iq tests of everyone in a company and then compare them to salary i can guarantee that the programmers will turn out to be underpaid rather than overpaid
775312 programmers deserve blame though and they do so because they will accept doing dumb changes that lead to bad applications
775313 if i click to the left of this text the entire article and all text within it is marked in my firefox 2

775316 and i would like to work for you amp get better right environment amp company of right people can help developers get better for those who want to do better
775317 dont waste time on talking to the users just start coding
775318 i want to click here and see a list of everything then i want to click an item and the system know that im wanting to reallocate it to joe bloggs because i viewed his record last
775319 the system doesnt read minds and cant be made to do what you want if you cant get to grips with that were not going to waste your money pretending that it can
775320 i honestly dont understand how kids find the energy and complete random behaviors that they do
775321 when i got him to settle early he just got into a galloping kind of pace and they just left him alone
775322 when he straightened up in the laneway he accelerated underneath me and i knew we had a big shot
775323 when he straightened up and i went past the quarter pole i asked him to run a little and i looked over and i saw a horse on the outside fence almost and wondered where did he come from
775324 after that it was great he just accelerated and i knew i had a good shot from there
775325 when youre going a mile and a half you want to ask your horse to run as late as possible because this laneway here believe me the wire looks like its in malton sometimes you want to be as quiet and give him as little to do as possible
775326 i tried to get him back by hitting him right handed just to straight him out
775327 marlang was pretty strong but i love my horse today note to self easy on the left hand with him
775328 i didnt want to take my horse away from his running style so i couldnt attack as early as maybe i wanted to
775329 i just couldnt get to him i got nosed out late
775330 im happy for debbie trainer debbie england because this is probably the biggest race shes ever won and shes done a very nice job with this horse
775331 from day 1 she told me this was probably best horse shes ever trained and she proved me right
775332 i think he handles polytrack but hes better on turf
775333 i could see he was relaxed and i knew hed be tough from then on
775334 he just kind of said im going to give you a horse to train and he did
775335 taking nothing away from the horse that finished second but when a maiden is the favourite i just thought if he could get up there and relax he could go the mile and a half print
775336 hey things act strangely when x y and z but not w are happening

775338 if north american churches do not accept the need for a moratoria on same sex blessings and the consecration of gay clergy we are no further forward we continue to be in grave peril
775339 we are concerned with the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches
775340 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
775341 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
775342 it sends the wrong message that gays and lesbians are still strangers at the gate its not going to change anything on the ground

775344 you say you want revolution id like to know why
775345 this song is probably the best piece of french house i have heard in a long time
775346 this song is so money and it doesnt even know it
775347 theres no one thing that you can do that is going to fix the problem but when people think about this area they often look to isps to provide the silver bullet
775348 they will cut us to pieces we know they are going to kill us
775349 either they will torture me or they will kill me
775350 they torture us with beatings with electricity they pour hot drinks down our throats no one can see you you just disappear
775351 they want to build their own islamic state and if you follow for example al aqsa tv which belongs to hamas you see its a new taliban state

775378 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
775379 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote

775396 my first reaction when i heard about snows was this is impossible
775397 it doesnt happen there are no unknown great barbecue places in texas
775398 i wrote that it was as soft and sweet as cookie dough

775417 congratulations to my team mate on his deserved first grand prix victory
775418 it the result for me was nowhere near as bad as it could have been as we could have had kimi and felipe ahead of us
775419 the race could have been better for me my start was ok but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me my lap times were good and i kept the gap slightly small with our strategy we still had the chance to pass him but the damaged tyre destroyed my race i dont know why it happened but at least i scored some points so the result was not too bad for me
775420 it has been a moment i have been targeting for many years now since i eyed the possibility to be a formula one driver i wanted to improve my fitness to try and achieve this goal and to achieve it is pleasing i am very happy with the win hopefully it is the first of many
775421 there have been various incidents this season that have happened when ive been in a position to fight for a victory today lewis and massa were fastest in the race i tried to put pressure on massa hoping he would have a mechanical failure and it seemed to work
775422 it is just unbelievable after the race in hockenheim and the big crash
775423 i could not believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was second i was under pressure from kimi with soft tyres and i was struggling quite a lot we knew since friday that the soft tyres would be difficult
775424 i had a really good car it was perfect until the last stint unbelievable in my first year

775426 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain i panicked when a climber fell straight on to my back i was terrified that we would all be pulled off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
775427 according to the rumours from the base camp there should be nine people dead and four still missing
775428 we were told that some climbers are still returning to the camps
775429 he was always in the humour for a joke a smile or a song
775430 hed always bring his bodhr n out when we summited a peak and give it a rattle
775431 for all climbers who have been in the death zone like places where ger and his pals disappeared on k2 we know the consequences of things going wrong theres always the possibility of not coming back but mountaineering is about living and believing you can do it
775432 gers drive courage bravery and ambition are an inspiration to us all
775433 with irish inflation running consistently ahead of our european colleagues for years it was always going to be difficult to secure a moderate pay deal
775434 the absence of any anti inflationary strategy by the government only exacerbated this problem what we are witnessing now is the unravelling of another key element of economic policy on foot of several years of soft option politics from brian cowen as minister for finance
775435 it remains to be seen what can be retrieved in the immediate future from this process
775436 kerry are the team to beat and always will be in fact this could be the best kerry team of all time if they win this all ireland that would be five finals in a row and winning four of them they are going to be a serious nut to crack for anyone left in the championship and whoever beats kerry will win the all ireland
775437 maybe theres a serious battle down the road with dublin
775438 that was a great match for us exactly what we needed a good game against a good team
775439 dont get me wrong we still have a load of work to do six points as a set of forwards in the first half wasnt good enough
775440 we had cool heads when it mattered thats when experience counts

775446 but having said that we always look at ways in which we can assist clinics or owners in these tough tough times and that is why i am meeting with dr lovell to explore what more we can do other than what we have done
775447 this is about queenslanders and a queensland business that employs people
775448 they need a helping hand to get them through this lengthy quarantine period and they have got not only to deal with that they have got to deal with the distress and concern they have for two of their colleagues who are in hospital
775449 businesses that have the courage to put their hand up and say ive got this disease then they shouldnt be left out to dry as a result of the quarantine
775450 there are 23 jobs on the line they have got two of their staff still in hospital that is very distressing for the highly respected owner of the business
775451 we couldnt ask for anything better and that will mean that it wont need a lot of rain now through its growing period to get through
775452 while i wasnt here when we hired john certainly hes the kind of coach that i would be looking at and im thrilled that hes here

775455 theres some significant storage capacity on those silver lines that will be accumulating a lot of grain from this harvest
775456 we estimate 30 000 more trucks annually would be added to the congestion around our ports
775457 when we met coach jack del rio told me theres a roster spot on this team and i can go out there and earn it thats all im trying to do
775458 the key is will he continue to do that and sustain that
775459 you see from the things that hes doing that he can be pretty darn good if we can get him to fight through soreness fatigue all those types of things and continue to play at a high level
775460 when my bodys healthy i think i can play with anybody and i think i can do a lot of good things and help this team win it definitely feels good
775461 were talking about having a shot at him by week four week five certainly for our bye week which comes in week seven
775462 were going to get him for the last 10 games of our regular season and hopefully we earn our way beyond that

775499 first off i want to apologize for my absence the past week some unforseen computer issues have taken me completely offline since last thursday although we should have those fixed by now
775500 i want to discuss an issue that i had no intention of bringing up again but whiny beaver fans have started sniffling again
775501 both teams have similar records over the past few years why is oregon so overrated and the beavers so underrated
775502 for the sake of beaver fan i have put together a list of major reasons nobody gives a flying shit about oregon state football
775503 1 your national perception is that of a loser ill give you credit you guys usually pull it together late and end up with a decent record at seasons end however due to our mind boggingly stupid tv contract most of your national tv games are non conference early in the season
775504 and those are the impression most people have of you
775505 meanwhile these same national tv fans have seen oregon beat michigan twice including one of the worst losses in wolverine history weve beaten oklahoma wisconsin and fresno state five times in a row yes we always seem to blow a late season matchup with arizona or stanford but national tv audiences see oregon beat big teams they see osu get drilled by mediocre ones
775506 2 nobody watches the las vegas emerald insight bowl beaver fans youve been to one bowl this decade that anyone really cares about fiesta maybe sun counts as a half so 1 5 meanwhile oregon has been to a fiesta two holidays and two sun bowls so four if you count the two sun bowls as a half each weve beaten texas and colorado and played oklahoma fairly even you did beat notre lame to your credit but lets be honest does anybody give a damn that you beat maryland in the emerald bowl or new mexico in the vegas this is why we dont give a shit about the byu game nobody outside of oregon or utah even remembers it happened
775507 3 nobody has any reason to consider you a serious contender youre 1 2 almost beforet he season starts and that one win is often against insert 1 aa foe here you can say what you want about oregons late season swoons and really thats just the last two seasons not some longstanding issue but at least we are contenders at some point see 2 in november last season we may have finished near the same point last year but why should anyone talk about a team that barely squeaked into the top 25 at the end of the season thats really the long and short of it while finishing fourth in the conference every year is consistent that is pretty much osus ceiling oregon will have a down year from time to time where we finish fifth or sixth but we are in competition for a conference championship on a regular basis
775508 lets talk about the real issue here again its beaver jealousy beavers jealous of our relationship with phil knight beavers jealous of our facilities beavers jealous of our uniforms yes jealous of our uniforms your insults fall on deaf ears until you stop wearing orange sports bras id be jealous of anyones uniforms if my team was wearing those jealous quite frankly that we have more money power and influence than you translation im obsessed with the beavers and thats why im writing so much about them im jealous of their superior on field results i really like their new uniforms but i wish i could still make jokes about the old ones however i bet youre jealous of all the influence we wielded when we got joey harrington 4th place in the heisman voting yep i bet nobody from the beavers has ever won one of those yes the style helps us a bit but everything is better with substance weve beaten the cream of the college football crop on a national stage texas oklahoma michigan youve struggled against mediocre out of conference competition and ultimately its that more than phil knight of giant billboards that people take us seriously and think of you as the little brother
775509 the division of labour is the source of economic growth

775531 so tell me john how do you expect to pilot our submarine i mean its a complicated piece of machinery you dont just press submerge
775532 but to kill him that would be cheating because my people also heard me make a promise and to break my word that would be the end of me too and then you came striding out of the jungle john to make my dream come true

775550 i was 34 when i started doing it and i probably started 10 years
775551 then i looked at the people at the top of the rankings and they were all pretty strong fellows tiger phil retief ernie vijay all big guys big shoulders i used to be big and i needed to put a bit of bulk on its paying dividends the weights helped tremendously
775552 im hitting the ball a lot further and when i want to make changes in my swing i can implement them a lot faster because my muscles are more responsive to change
775553 if i hadnt won in the states id feel there was something missing in my career
775554 you want to win everywhere dont you that youre capable of winning im proud that ive won on every tour basically european asian and southern african
775555 these are a rung down from the major championships obviously but i havent won a world golf championships so thats obviously missing on my cv it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into next week too
775556 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference but i made a few as well so that kind of evens it out
775557 i thought the crowds were great they were funny made some funny comments and it was really fun they were great to both me and vijay it was a great day we both birdied 15 we both birdied 16 and i thought both of us played okay played pretty good
775558 its going to be a big challenge with four guys being right there and a number of guys right behind us so im not really thinking about what it would mean
775559 i still have to go out and shoot a pretty low round with these guys that are playing some good golf i think that were all in good position but i feel like ive played well the first three rounds and im looking forward to a nice shootout
775560 starting dec 1 in the u s and canada and coming soon after to an additional 13 international markets microsoft will make available free downloadable product trials via office online
775561 note to customers in france office 2007 has not been authorized for supply import or export to or from france if you are located in france microsoft does not authorize the download of this product until further notice
775562 for you developers out there later in the week ill post the final office 2007 schema for ribbon development which you can use to author
775563 but because the windows interface guidelines for software design microsoft press 1995 and the online documentation that comes with visual c suggest you use sdi instead of mdi this article the final installment in a series that began last june discusses documents views and other aspects of the document view architecture with an emphasis on the single document interface
775564 note mdi is an application oriented model many new and intermediate users find it difficult to learn to use mdi applications therefore many applications are switching to a document oriented model therefore you may want to consider other models for your user interface however you can use mdi for applications which do not easily fit into an existing model until a more suitable model is introduced
775565 ack all my excel documents closed when i clicked x word doesnt do that i wrote this nice set of simple vba add ins for excel and powerpoint
775566 can i use the new office user interface in my own product
775567 the license excludes products or components that perform primarily as software for word processing spreadsheets presentations email contacts and databases and that are created or marketed as a replacement for any or all of them
775568 i fail to see how microsoft can protect the concept of a ribbon style user interface sure they can licence out the graphics but the concept
775569 the layout of controls on the ribbon must change in real time when the application window is resized by dragging with the mouse the change in the layout of controls on the ribbon must not be delayed until after the application window has been resized and the left mouse button is released
775570 man how are we going to keep our competitors from copying our ui this time hey i got it well give it away to our non competitors thus trying to demonstrate some kind of ownership and hopefully that will both intimidate people out of copying it and also give us a better leg to stand on in court
775571 on the other hand the new office user interface was a huge investment by microsoft and the resulting intellectual property belongs to microsoft
775572 the license excludes products or components that perform primarily as software for word processing spreadsheets presentations email contacts and databases and that are created or marketed as a replacement for any or all of them
775573 and you said you invest a lot of money into r amp d good but really it is the same as if some other small vendor invests a fraction of its revenues into research
775574 here is what i would suggest someone ibm should set up a very small company with limited liability does that exist in the us it certainly does in germany then that company forks the openoffice dev tree and clones the ribbon let ms sue see them loose in court and have this nonsene out of the world the risk is small at most the very small amount of capital that this pseudo company would by liable for would be lost the potential gains are huge this nonsense attempt to ip protect look and feel would be sorted out in court quickly and hopefully dismissed
775575 it is not clear at the moment that this license is even required
775576 call your buttonclicked function with this iribboncontrol parameter and let me know how it goes
775577 i would like my add in to load when the host application loads
775578 note that office queries the iribbonextensibility interface for idispatch instead of the main interface normally this is unimportant but it allows complicated add ins to split their idispatch interfaces off onto multiple objects if they provide multiple idispatch implementations for example excel add ins can provide user defined functions udfs via idispatch and they usually wont want to have all of their ribbonx callbacks and udfs on the same object
775579 you may have an older type library registered instead such as

775584 helen clarks dreaming in 1984 when rob muldoon left office debt to gdp was enormous
775585 i just think its mind boggling stupid you go out and borrow at a time when the international markets are in crisis
775586 the big idea is just borrow the money run up the debt all our students know how hard it is to pay a debt back all our families know how hard it is to pay a mortgage back and here we are in the middle of international financial market turmoil and the national party want to borrow the money
775587 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen this situation we will be careful stewards of the economy and of taxpayers money
775588 on the other hand we need to keep things in perspective small operating deficits for a limited time are not the end of the world
775589 our policy focus is on lifting our prospects over the next three to five years
775590 it is a tragedy of new zealand history that previous national administrations got our country into a mess in the past through massive overseas borrowings
775591 the hurt caused to families and to small businesses when those damaging policies eventually had to be corrected was immense in our not so distant past

775607 this decision has been something that has crossed my mind for some time i had every ambition to lead the england team to the next ashes series 2009 but as england captain i feel ive run out of steam
775608 i believe that the best thing for the team is to embark on a new direction under a new captain
775609 michael has been the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the type of character he has instilled in the england dressing room
775610 one of the reasons i havent scored the runs is my mind hasnt been as fresh
775611 i believe these could be the best years of my playing career i want to get my focus come back and score plenty of runs
775612 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket

775616 we as teachers collaborated and thought it would be a nice kind of educational and entertaining theme
775617 the students are researching all of the artists and the specific pieces that were working on
775618 but it certainly is a huge problem to the owner of a dog who lost it and couldnt find it and it didnt get returned if you can see the face of a kid whose dog doesnt get returned to him or the fear of a child bit by an unknown dog these things are issues in my opinion that need to be addressed
775619 what ive noticed is that the seniors seem to embrace this with enthusiasm as much as the kids at the end of the day the youth have done something positive for the health and safety of the community and the seniors have participated in this community
775620 i have the seniors and the youth center going out and knocking on everyones door

775623 we have to have them make an application its been a source of frustration for those people who never knew i dont write the code i just enforce it
775624 if the village people are satisfied with the results it could be an ongoing project
775625 during my campaign i wanted to find a way that we could have the college and village work together
775626 the students have to create a marketing plan anyway they can choose a case study or work on the village marketing plan
775627 im so excited that the college is receptive to working with its neighbors in east rochester
775628 i feel this could bring a lot of positive change into the village by bringing people outside of the village in to see the wonderful assets we have in east rochester
775629 we have quite a few restaurants we have a skate park we have gymnastics small grocery stores a baseball training facility its really an attractive place to come and see its a great place to visit come shop and eat

775636 for many consumers the early days of mobile internet were filled with great potential but experiences were throttled by network quality like getting keys to a new sports car to discover it has the engine of a go cart or more aptly like returning to dial up speeds while having full knowledge of the breadth of content that lies just out of reach

775695 the world wide web architecture has evolved into a novel architectural style that i call representational state transfer using elements of the client server pipe and filter and distributed objects paradigms this style optimises the network transfer of representations of a resource a web based application can be viewed as a dynamic graph of state representations pages and the potential transitions links between states the result is an architecture that separates server implementation from the clients perception of resources scales well with large numbers of clients enables transfer of data in streams of unlimited size and type supports intermediaries proxies and gateways as data transformation and caching components and concentrates the application state within the user agent components

775713 we no longer have to evaluate a man based on whether or not theyre going to be a good provider and take care of us
775714 older women know exactly what they want and arent afraid to make that clear
775715 sometimes it can be a bit confronting but its mostly great not having to play games i find older women are less needy more independent
775716 the game playing is over by the time you get into your late 30s or 40s youve learnt a lot and made mistakes so its easier to be honest i found the older guys ive dated have been more set in their ways maybe they have a more traditional expectation of how a woman should be in a relationship younger men are more open and less threatened by a smart successful woman

775722 grimilde carrrrraaa ma come sei ridotta ho sentito quello che ti hanno fatto quei cattivoni dei nani e biancaneve era una sposa cos adoraaabile con il suo principe ho letto che ti hanno fatto causa
775723 e tu gertrunda con la tua dolcerosa come te la stai cavando con tua nipote
775724 ma come non lhai saputo non vedi che sono in lutto la povera dolcerosa morta sob sob
775725 barista un altro e anche uno alla mia amica grimilde
775726 ma come hai fatto aveva una fata madrina tra le pi potenti che
775727 ohohoh ahahaha cara la mia regina invece di perdere tanto tempo a specchiarti e a leggere libri di magia avresti dovuto provare con la psicologia guarda me io sono sempre stata meno abile di te con gli incantesimi eppure ho raggiunto e affondato il mio bersaglio pow
775728 quellimpicciona di fata madrina laveva circondata di incantesimi protettivi e per di pi laveva dotata dei soliti tre desideri dotazione standard allora mi sono detta ecco unaltra storia in cui la virt e limbecillit vincono ma se sappiamo come vanno le storie sappiamo anche come va il mondo ho pensato e se uso la storia a mio vantaggio cos lho portata a vedere biancaneve
775729 biancaneve tua figliastra pallida come un pesce lesso corpo da urlo leggero ritardo mentale ricordi dentro la teca di cristallo immobile come morta i poveri nanetti in lacrime costretti a vegliarla tu sai comera sensibile la povera dolcerosa ha subito detto ah preferirei morire che rimanere cos per sempre
775730 emb ha espresso uno dei suoi tre desideri il resto stato facile ah posa qua i bicchieri ragazzo
775731 ho trovato il cavallo pi selvaggio e bastardo che esista nei regni lho fatto drogare e acconciare ben bene da minipony quando biancarosa lha visto lha voluto immediatamente e paf il secondo desiderio era andato ovviamente il cavallo lha schiantata alla prima sgroppata
775732 ma non basta cadere da cavallo per ammazzare le principesse delle fiabe le protezioni magiche
775733 ma certo cara figurarsi se non ci avevo pensato sarebbe bastato il bacio del solito principe a risvegliarla ma hai dimenticato il suo primo desiderio
775734 lhai detto il suo stesso desiderio era lunica mag a cos forte da abbattere le protezioni che lamore della sua madrina avevano posto e stata lei stessa ad ucciderla in fondo
775735 nelle storie dove il genio o il rospo magico o la fata madrina ti danno tre desideri cos il terzo desiderio
775736 e semplice in ogni storia che si rispetti che sa come va il mondo il terzo desiderio quello che disfa il danno causato dai primi due
775737 vedi bene grimilde che cosa mi ha permesso di vincere ho fatto in modo che il terzo desiderio non potesse essere pronunciato
775738 va bene imposto la costante di planck al secondo valore
775739 direi che questa costante va bene daccordo vediamo la seconda costante fondamentale accidenti

775741 ci siamo quasi sotto con la terza costante dunque vediamo ecco un asteroide provo a ma che
775742 qui la materia molto pi dura che nel nostro universo non credo che neanche unesplosione atomica ne staccherebbe un pezzo da queste parti i letti devono essere parecchio scomodi meglio provare con un altro valore della costante di struttura fine
775743 troppo molle a questo punto il terzo valore oh qui sembra andare proprio bene questo luniverso che fa per me
775744 qui qualcuno ha sondato un universo ma lha trovato troppo caldo
775745 questo invece lha gradito tant che entrato strappando la parete
775746 e qui invece gli piaciuto e ci entrato un altro buco
775747 lo strappo molto grosso e chi lha fatto ancora qui
775748 ci credo questo luniverso che ho fatto per il figlio su misura per lui
775749 e meno male che c sempre uno che canta e la tristezza te la fa passare senn la nostra vita sarebbe come una barchetta in mezzo al mare dove tra la ragazza la miniera apparentemente non c confine dove la vita un lavoro a cottimo e il cuore un cespuglio di spine

775766 mr longdon this is the sunnyvale police my name is captain fach
775767 mr longdon this is because tonight under very strange circumstances java got killed im sending a car over to pick you up we need your help to solve this mystery
775768 only that ive read about a similar case recently during my vacation
775769 net can be read backwards saying ten this probably means that java was attacked by ten maniacs backwards this would also explain the dot at the beginning of net which would signify the end when read back to front
775770 the rest was written by someone who knows more about math than dan brown the mystery author
775771 because the number 0 is included this my dear captain is the beginning of the fibonacci sequence including the zero
775772 mr brown omitted the zero is that what youre saying
775773 and he forgot to mention that the fibonacci sequence is endless it doesnt end at 21
775774 what about the funny order of the numbers isnt the fibonacci sequence in order
775775 that is right it goes 0 1 1 2 3 5 etc maybe java was dyslexic that would explain what were seeing here
775776 i can assure you that with assumptions like the ones you make youre not going to make many friends in some communities that may read my report what else can you tell me
775777 maybe the other lines are in the wrong order too maybe bag sell it has to be changed somehow mingled mixed repositioned to point to the java killer
775778 i think we have to look for the solution somewhere else
775779 i mean lets look at the rivals of java who would be happy with javas demise
775780 close but no cigar bag sell it is an anagram
775781 java points to bill gates as the reason it was dying
775782 the bottom line is that net certainly the new version is becoming the development environment of choice for many programmers who used to code in java
775783 the reason java was dying when it wrote down the mysterious symbols
775784 why dont you see if theyll come out to the cowboys billy could ride a horse or something
775785 arrest is an instantaneous shattering thrust expulsion somersault from one state into another
775786 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
775787 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
775788 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others
775789 it is going to be uncomfortable horrible to live in such a country
775790 sometimes though you got thinking and your spirits soared your sentence was running out there wasnt much thread left on the spool lord just to think of it walking free on your own two legs
775791 standing there to be counted through the gate of an evening back in camp after a whole day of buffeting wind freezing cold and an empty belly the zek longs for his ladleful of scalding hot watery evening soup as for rain in time of drought he could knock it back in a single gulp for the moment that ladleful means more to him than freedom more than his whole past life more than whatever life is left to him
775792 shukhov felt pleased with life as he went to sleep
775793 the end of an unclouded day almost a happy one
775794 just one of the three thousand six hundred and fifty three days of his sentence from bell to bell
775795 in the past few years hundreds of muslims have committed suicide amid innocent civilians without making concrete political demands and without generating any vigorous sustained condemnation in the muslim world muslims have got to understand that a death cult has taken root in the bosom of their religion feeding off it like a cancerous tumor if muslim leaders dont remove this cancer and only they can it will spread tainting innocent muslims and poisoning their relations with each other and the world
775796 this is not americas war to win or lose we have given the iraqi people the chance to have freedom to have their own country it is up to them to decide whether or not theyre going to take that chance
775797 in the twentieth century the strength of a great power is diminished if it ceases to serve an idea
775798 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
775799 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
775800 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
775801 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
775802 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
775803 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
775804 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
775805 if it does succeed its going to be done in a way thats subtle enough that its there for people who want it
775806 but its not going to be intrusive for people who dont

776007 the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his field though it is the smallest of all your seeds yet when it grows it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches
776008 to speculate on the intrinsic essence of things i hold to be as hopeless an undertaking and as vain an endeavour in substances close to us as in those far away in the heavens for i know as little truly about the substance of the earth as of the moon about clouds as about sunspots
776009 ok when i leave here today i will feel so much better and be lifted up and be more positive
776010 over the last two years we have been color flagging whimbrels and hudsonian godwits on chiloe island chile
776011 over 20 000 each of godwits and whimbrels spend the boreal winter in the vicinity of chiloe using a cannon net we have marked 323 godwits and 135 whimbrels
776012 besides banding the birds we collected blood took measurements assessed molt and collected samples for avian influenza
776013 the blood will be used in a genetics study to determine the origin of the birds there are tentative plans to attach satellite transmitters to whimbrels next year
776014 they fly off screaming if you go near them so i knew it would be a long term project
776015 the perch is bolted onto a christmas tree stand submerged in the water and weighted down with cinder blocks
776016 if they see you theyll leave and youre done for the day
776017 the only issue with this is you have to be careful what species of fish youre putting in a lake
776018 we have no intention to harm the woods in any way
776019 i think weve done a pretty good job of that
776020 we had a great time in giant sequoia national monument it was a long drive but the beautiful immense trees pretty wildflowers mountain breezes and of course the high country birds made it all worth it in addition to the regular
776021 the most impressive paper in the higher level phylogeny of birds to come along in a long time it will be used by avian systematists and nonavian systematists for a very long time
776022 yet the close relationship between passerines with parrots and or falcons appeared consistently
776023 can change the way people look at the evolution of flight
776024 because many aquatic birds were not part of the water bird clade e g tropicbirds flamingos and grebes and terrestrial birds were found outside of the land bird clade e g turacos doves sandgrouse and cuckoos
776025 first appearances can be deceiving birds that look or act similar are not necessarily related second much of bird classification and conventional wisdom on the evolutionary relationships of birds is wrong

776029 macd upward crossed zero line 3 days ago and still up macd 8 17 9 as the macd gets older the time we have available to hold the trade becomes shorter and shorter an macd green arrow that is older than 2 days provides a fairly weak positive signal and still needs to be combined with a stochastics green arrow this signal is ok in a bullish market environment but is much riskier in a down trending one a conservative investor will take action on an macd green arrow only when it is combined with 150 of the average volume to avoid a fake out
776030 it helps to get a sense of the market trend the best way to do that without using tools that cost money is to track spy dia and qqqq on a chart with a 10 day and a 50 day ma and the same stoch and macd that we use on everything else
776031 these three stocks are exchange traded funds that you can buy like stocks these three track the s amp p 500 the dow jones and the nasdaq 100 watching what they are doing with the tools can give you an idea of the trend of the market in addition you can put in etfs for major industries and track those as an indication of the big money moves in and out of those specific stock groups short of paying money to investools thats the best i can offer you

776037 revealed a widespread reluctance to commit to a blu ray player in the near future
776038 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40 percent termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players

776043 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

776045 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
776046 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
776047 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
776048 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
776049 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
776050 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
776051 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
776052 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
776053 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
776054 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
776055 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
776056 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
776057 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
776058 shiloh and z pick out the twins clothes and help change and hold them
776059 the consumers expectation is if the photos are going to be available im going to see them in people if we dont get them we miss that brand promise we lose the halo that goes with that
776060 a jmc obama campaign would be good for the country one conducted between two men who respect each other and respect the opinions of the voters republicans would welcome such a campaign rich in ideas and poor in rancor the two men respect each other do not sell jmc short in such a campaign he represents an integrity and heroism that simply cannot be denied
776061 one of the prime qualities a leading movie star must have is f ability do you honestly think that its talent alone that puts them into leading category as opposed to character actor falling in love with the hero or heroine of the movie is often what its all about if that doesnt happen for you then the movie wont work for you
776062 to make it in this industry you gotta have f ability

776109 in a tentative move to comment on the realm of opera i was thrilled to see cheryl barker take out the award for best female performer in an opera this was for her title role performance in arabella which i did not see but who cares i saw and heard barker in otello last week and oh my gosh here is another perfect candidate to support my theme i did happen to be there eighteen years ago on the opening night of baz luhrmann catherine martins la boheme which not only set that mildly talented duo up for all that has since followed but where cheryl barker made us weep as a most tender of mimis a star was born cheryl barker look at you now your desdemona is incandescent you are in full flight as the guy who gets to hangs out in the stalls with the punters i had to stop and pinch myself how goddam lucky am i

776113 this is otello in wwii in the stately home of a bunch of fascists no overdone political statements though just an atmosphere of unsettlingly recognisable fear and deception setting it here also neatly sidesteps the controversial cosmetics issue to blackface or not to blackface
776114 referred to in several more episodes and finally mentioned as having gone to tasmania
776115 you can have it high quality fast or cheap pick two of the three
776116 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
776117 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this
776118 i figured he was like everyone else in hollywood a democrat
776119 and we knew that this was not a democrat movie
776120 we were afraid that he would not want to be involved in something that was so directly taking on the left and that he would not want to play the michael moore character
776121 i thought that the minute we started talking about politics that would be the end
776122 there was this dance that we did a dance familiar to conservative actors in hollywood lots of actors have done it
776123 i usually just bite my tongue unless it gets too ridiculous
776124 the only thing that really bothers me is when they go off about the president it just gets annoying
776125 if its the last movie i do ill go work for steves company
776126 the only thing that really bothers me is when they go off about the president it just gets annoying
776127 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
776128 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
776129 we cant design our own products and we have no idea what people want from them so were going to tell people weve hired some dude who always gets it wrong with no product design experience whatsoever to help us design it
776130 a star product like the iphone does a lot of great things for apple but when things go wrong it can bring down the entire image of a company
776131 its been a rocky road and we know the pain some people have been suffering
776132 vista wasnt finished and thats what the iphone feels like
776133 its been rushed onto market even though it wasnt ready
776134 people line up for it so it must be good
776135 people line up for it so it must be good
776136 the word count is still long because the media cant find anyone who can churn out rent a quotes as reliably as rob enderle the networks and publishers line up for him so he has to be good but that misconception cant last forever
776137 this actually isnt such a far flung idea if you think about it current macbooks can use gestures to control the machine
776138 also a setting can be activated that allows clicking by just tapping the trackpad in fact many pcs have been doing this for years the loss of a mouse button wont be as drastic as you might initially think
776139 at least 140 people have died in a stampede at a hindu temple in the indian state of himachal pradesh a rain shelter on the mountain path to the temple collapsed triggering rumours of a landslide tens of thousands of devotees had been gathering to celebrate the annual nine day festival of shravan navratras an investigation is now under way into the incident at the nainadevi temple in the bilsapur district about 160km 100 miles from the himalayan hill town of shimla thousands of hindu worshippers were climbing up a 4 km 2 5 mile trail leading to the hilltop temple chanting and singing hymns when the stampede happened
776140 theres an interesting contrast to be made here between open and closed development methodologies the mozilla project has had a bug open on this issue http bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id 122445 for over two years which has drawn over 170 comments with plenty of great ideas but no approved solution microsoft on the other hand have remained silent on the issue until we can only assume the bad publicity surrounding it forced them to act at which point they announced a fix that appears to gly in the face of commonly accepted web standards but does undoubtedly solve the problem of course with no chance for user feedback prior to the decision it amounts to little less than a decree from god which correlates directly to their inarguable domination of the browser market at least in terms of market share
776141 marco one user reports that he cant connect to our sister site with his credentials he has just installed security patch ms04 004 from microsoft
776142 yes that patch has broken our small ssl single sign on system
776143 you cant throw out the window all applications made in five years
776144 most oil companies have hardly begun to factor in the externalities that are currently imposed on the environment

776147 my b s flag really went up when they said they wanted my address to pick me up at night
776148 which has helped torment our men and women in uniform
776149 but i am not going to entrust al jazeera with my life
776150 honestly i think we should just trust our president in every decision he makes and should just support that you know and be faithful in what happens
776151 no one has supported president bush on iraq more than i have let me emphasize that there are many national security issues that i have strongly supported the president and steadfastly so
776152 i dont think that mccain is proud of the ads hes running right now
776153 i bet john mccain is embarrassed a little bit by some of these ads
776154 all i can say is were proud of that britney spears commercial
776155 these campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign weve run
776156 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans
776157 it is a decent margin but it is not a landslide
776158 it would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008
776159 these hotels are justifiably outraged by this order which puts them in the awkward position of having to craft pop up messages explaining to their customers that their web history communications searches and key strokes are being spied on by the chinese government
776160 he added that the chinese program can be used on journalists on athletes on their families democracy advocates and human rights advocates
776161 lieberman defends hagee his holocaust comments were taken way out of context
776162 sessions was publicly livid over janet jacksons liberal values when she bared her covered boobs during the superbowl a few years back
776163 it is hypocritical for bill keffer who claims to be the champion of morality to continue accepting pete sessions political patronage and strip club money he should denounce congressman sessions for using a strip club venue to raise money and he should return the monies given to him by sessions or that sessions helped him raise for use in his own campaign
776164 i think often times they look at the usual suspects
776165 i think dalton jones was thinking this is a dangerous person and whether he did it or whether he didnt im going to get him off the street
776166 reflect that lorden is unable to fairly and reliably describe the circumstances of the offense
776167 weve got a serious problem here that goes beyond coughing up cases where snitches were helpful
776168 the whole criminal justice system is being intimidated by the way this thing is being run and in many cases especially at the local level mishandled a lot of people have died because of misinformation
776169 we have the most data on capital and homicide convictions because they are the most high profile
776170 so we have no idea how many wrongful convictions there are in larceny cases or assault cases or any other because nobody is paying any attention to those
776171 the governments use of criminal informants is largely secretive unregulated and unaccountable
776172 this lack of oversight and quality control leads to wrongful convictions more crime disrespect for the law and sometimes even official corruption
776173 if the criminal system cant get homicide cases right then its very unlikely that were getting other things right
776174 very few people will look at that kind of prison time and not cooperate
776175 we have this incredible institution for cooperators and informants yet for the kind of cooperating we need the most there are really no resources
776176 youre not supposed to of course you are trained to maintain your objectivity
776177 but you spend time with this guy you get to know him and his family you like him you believe that he has come clean hopefully the assistant has a skeptical mindset but the reality is that the cooperators information often becomes your mindset
776178 sometimes prosecutors are convinced they have the guilty guy then they go about seeking to convict and do not carefully look at things that are funny about their case
776179 most prosecutors are very very young especially at the state level
776180 theyre new graduates of law school or theyve done some other job for a few years but theyre mostly in their late 20s early 30s tops with very little experience its one of the reasons that office policies that just tell them what to do are so important
776181 the established safeguards of the anglo american legal system leave the veracity of a witness to be tested by cross examination and the credibility of his testimony to be determined by a properly instructed jury
776182 lets say the government does disclose compensation and the jury knows about it
776183 you would think and the supreme court certainly thinks that that will make a difference well psychological research has found that it makes almost no difference that jurors ignore the fact that the witness is compensated
776184 the supreme court has held that while defendants who go to trial are entitled to impeachment material about their informants defendants who plead guilty are not
776185 so that means that most defendants will never see the deal that the informant got
776186 when we appropriately manage informants great cases ones that make our community safe are the result
776187 when informants are improperly used the results can be devastating but without the ability to freely use informants law enforcement would have very few significant investigative successes
776188 and it doesnt have to necessarily be a matter of legislation but it could be a matter of individual prosecutors offices adopting specific policies it can be a matter of local ordinances it can be case law where judges start to intervene its a slow process and as of yet there is no uniform informants act
776189 given the prevalence of informant falsehoods in wrongful capital convictions such hearings should be mandatory in capital cases even where the defense intends to concede guilt and move directly to the sentencing phase
776190 after identifying the legal obligations of the haitian government in the field of health our project will gather partners and resources for a coordinated medical and legal response
776191 the world court order is fully consistent with u s international law obligations that support fundamental norms especially the right to life if the united states executes these individuals in defiance of the court it will be that much harder for the next president to rebuild the standing of the u s in the world especially as a state committed to the rule of law and fundamental human rights
776192 the question now is whether the president will take effective steps to comply with the new order which requires action he has already acknowledged he is bound to carry out
776193 the negative impact of defying the court in this case will be particularly strong because the u s itself went to the world court and cited the very treaties at issue here when americans were taken hostage in iran in november 1979 the courts order in favor of the u s then was instrumental in securing the hostages release we need the world court and the law it implements which means we also need to respect the court and international law

776201 we want to have a serious debate but so far weve been hearing about paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what the election is about is that worthy of the american people even the media has pointed out that mccain has fallen back into predictable political attacks and demonstratively false statements spending all this time talking about me instead of talking about what hes going to do thats not going to lower your gas prices thatss not going to help you find a job if its been shipped overseas it doesnt do a single thing to help the american people its the politics of the game but the time for game playing is over thats why im running for president

776267 series today i finally get quickr entry see sometimes you have to use social software to really understand its value so let me tell you a brief story
776268 there will be veterans who have been here who will get more reps and there will be rookies who have to get a lot of reps as well
776269 its most definitely a big change you get the wrong person hurt and you got to throw in a guy thats valuable to your team and it can affect some people down the line
776270 its harder with more veteran guys because then you can have few extra guys who can take reps during practice that they didnt have to
776271 thats kind of a hindrance same thing with playing in the games you dont have seven or eight guys to take some reps from guys who are going to play only four to five plays but now theyre going to play more because we dont have the numbers so it makes things a little more tricky because people have to take a lot more reps than they would
776272 if you have any guys hurt at that position it could be devastating
776273 thats a tough rule 80 especially when you have that extra game and you come to camp early you have to be very careful how you practice
776274 its an amazing experience to be able to tell people how much i love my dad
776275 he led by example always consistent and true to what he believed
776276 he was the best dad we talk maybe 10 times a day hes always so encouraging
776277 he never pushed me to football only encouraged me to do the best i could
776278 i had to beg dad to let me try out for football we never talked football at home and once i started playing he kept his distance
776279 he told me it was my time just try to do good
776280 always attending his games never going on the field except once at oakton i forgot my gloves one game and dad went and got me a pair brought them to me

776286 if youre frightened of dying and youre holding on youll see devils tearing your life away but if youve made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth
776287 then seeing you have sinned with the multitude you shall now go to hell with the multitude
776288 the infamous operation vistula is a symbol of the abominable deeds perpetrated by the communist authorities against polish citizens of ukrainian origin
776289 operation vistula was the revenge for the slaughter of poles by the ukrainian insurgent army
776290 we all know that kuchma is not accepted by the vast majority of ukrainian society
776291 how then could we expect that he would apologize on behalf of the ukrainian people
776292 the local people did not want to talk to us the atmosphere before the ceremony was tense
776293 the idea of presenting the problem as an axis of polish ukrainian reconciliation was senseless because there is no historical tension between our nations and relations between the two neighboring states are developing in a positive direction
776294 the truth of those dramatic years is painful for everyone
776295 over the past six months the ukrainian mass media has aired the opinions of our academics politicians and journalists on the events in volhynia far more than in the previous decades
776296 to a large extent provoked a decisive reaction by the most influential ukrainian political force in the region the organization of ukrainian nationalists
776297 for the inhabitants of western ukraine the upa nationalists are national heroes while in central and eastern ukraine people see them as bandits
776298 the ukrainians themselves have not yet squared up to their history
776299 a civilized person cannot ignore the argument that the oun and upa murdered innocent children and women
776300 neither polish nor ukrainian scientists were allowed to deal with the volhynia massacres
776301 was killing poles under the motto of fighting communism under the same motto polish servants of the hitler police were burning ukrainian villages
776302 ukrainians do not have any experience of open discussion about crimes they themselves committed
776303 we apologize to those poles whose lives were shattered by ukrainian weapons we apologize to the whole of polish society we are sorry that those weapons were directed against innocent civilian polish families and we acknowledge that the removal of the polish population from volhynia by force was a tragic mistake
776304 the time for common talks about the history of polish ukrainian relations has yet to come
776305 it is not true that the past never comes back
776306 its ghosts stay well time does not heal the wounds and is not a good doctor at least not in ukraines and polands complicated relationship
776307 the truth of a pole from volhynia clashes with the truth of volhynian ukrainian the truth of western ukraine with the truth of eastern ukraine the truth of a nationalist will never match the truth of a democrat either in poland or ukraine
776308 he understands that a show is a concept and the pieces you put together as a designer should come alive on the runway to tell a story furthermore opulence and extravagance is always boldly displayed within tlale collection
776309 this is important for example in cases where you want to display just the top results from a search based on some numeric metric of relevancy or if you want to start your own pop music countdown the simplest algorithm running the first
776310 oscar likes movies that earn a respectable amount of money unless they earn such a vast amount that it becomes unseemly until said vast amount passes a certain plateau at which point the unseemliness ceases to bother anybody too much
776311 preliminary experiments have shown surprisingly that co cache oblivious b trees can outperform traditional b trees sometimes by factors of more than 2
776312 profiling was used to find an optimal chunk size too small and performance approaches that of a char structure too large larger than the l2 cache and performance also falls away in practice a chunk size that allows the working set to fit comfortably in the l2 cache has been found to be best
776313 one problem with blocking is selecting the block size it has to be chosen carefully with the particular architecture and cache sizes in mind to get optimal performance in the blitz library i decided to adopt a slightly different approach based on the hilbert space filling curve in this approach there are two loops an outer loop which follows an approximation to the hilbert space filling curve 1 and an inner loop 2 which traverses the corresponding column of the array the space filling curve ensures good cache use and the inner loop allows the cpu pipelines to pick up steam as the column is traversed ive found this traversal ordering has a very nice property performance increases steadily for every extra bit of cache you have resulting in good performance on all platforms for most platforms the l1 cache hit rate is 70 to 76 compared to only 54 for the fortran 77 program described above this isnt the case for blocked algorithms where performance makes abrupt jumps at critical cache sizes making tuning very platform dependent
776314 dont worry about that ill get to that later when i talk about x
776315 well i was janice lester and wanted to be captain kirk except i got away with it
776316 i need the phone number of bert jabins marina in annapolis
776317 were a running company so for us to put on the largest race in the world shouldnt be a surprise to anybody
776318 theres lots of creativity plenty of adaptations and its an exciting way to do business
776319 but its not our race im much more risk averse than nike were just along for the ride
776320 so there will be a lot of national attention i think ill have enough to be concerned about so ill be able to concentrate on my responsibilities and itll be a fun game for the fans even though theyre going to see a lot of different people play i think it will be a fun game to watch i think itll be entertaining on television
776321 the younger players we have they dominated at their positions at the college level and they have to now learn how to dominate at the pro level
776322 i have no interest in polite and clever conversation anymore ive been rendered a social cripple by god
776323 before you point your fingers be sure your hands are clean
776324 with the reality that many are not happy in their circumstances and choose to permeate their pain onto others
776325 theyre telling omb we really need your help we know this is important
776326 as you see more agencies completing migrations to shared service centers and completing the move from legacy systems you will see more people moving off the list
776327 father i know that i have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you i am truly sorry and now i want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you please forgive me and help me avoid sinning again i believe that your son jesus is the messiah and he died for my sins was resurrected from the dead is alive and hears my prayer i invite jesus to become the lord of my life to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward please send your holy spirit to help me obey you and to do your will for the rest of my life amen
776328 it will be done right because thats the bottom line
776329 one of the eyebrow raising statistics about the bpa studies is the stark divergence in results depending on who funded them
776330 what they are doing is developing their own system for evaluating things
776331 eek i for got to tell you ftp isnt working at the moment high level tech guys are working on fixing it or so im told p i keep getting panicky emails from them so i assume its true vbg
776332 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
776333 specialize a gallon of gas costs money yet little is accomplished for the higher prices
776334 the problem with reducing the number of fuels is how do you do it
776335 a more uniform national spec would definitely help utilize the existing infrastructure a lot more efficiently
776336 theres a reason why californians pay a lot more for gasoline than the rest of the nation
776337 there was this perception that the phoenix market was going to run out of fuel and so you had price spikes and complaints of retailers gouging the public
776338 even during the hurricanes there was never a shortage of that kind of fuel
776339 this year its been all about the crude oil price rise
776340 at no time was there any risk to the reactor plant the safety of the crew or the safety of the public
776341 less than the quantity of naturally occurring radioactivity in a bag of common lawn and garden fertilizer
776342 ask not what you can do for your country but ask what your country can do for you
776343 oliver wendell holmes said taxes are the price we pay for civilization ballards idea of civilization is some kind of marine corps
776344 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
776345 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq are going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
776346 you know the truth is that this was an example where we had some poor phrasing in the speech and we immediately tried to correct the interpretation that was given the point we were simply making was is that we dont want barbed wire running through jerusalem similar to the way it was prior to the 67 war that it is possible for us to create a jerusalem that is cohesive and coherent
776347 i rejoice at violent and bloody demise of our enemies
776348 one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences
776349 a single scud missile carrying a single nuclear weapon detonated at the appropriate altitude would interact with the earths atmosphere producing an electromagnetic pulse radiating down to the surface at the speed of light depending on the location and size of the blast the effect would be to knock out already stressed power grids and other electrical systems across much or even all of the continental united states for months if not years
776350 it would not harm people initially like a traditional nuclear bomb it would affect communication systems computers electrical appliances and automobile and aircraft ignition systems pacemakers or other electrical implants the pulse would wipe out most electronics and telecommunications including the power grid millions could die for want of modern medical care or even of starvation since farmers wouldnt be able to harvest crops and distributors wouldnt be able to get food to supermarkets

776353 because it might make an impact to the texas shore were looking at activating resources including search and rescue and maybe military forces
776354 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
776355 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
776356 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
776357 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
776358 we have done everything to improve flight safety which has to do with the operators and regulators in the country s airline business but we still did not get an appropriate response
776359 we also regret the unilateral ban imposed by the eu before consulting indonesia the judgement made by the eu has yet to satisfy indonesia
776360 indonesia has really been shamed this is a setback because our country continues to be considered a marginal one incapable of ensuring flight safety
776361 for the sake of indonesian sovereignty there are only two solutions namely compromise or the opposite don t only assess the eu s intention toward politics while there was no courage to take a political decision
776362 we should make the necessary corrections and improvements to secure flight safety the eu needs to be informed about this namely that we are responsible for the improvement of flight safety and security
776363 the flight operators need to give more attention to flight safety therefore the regulators should not be lax and permissive in this case if there is a deviation that may risk flight safety
776364 drawing a lesson from many accidents in the past ten years regardless of the eu ban we have to make all out efforts to improve transportation safety
776365 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can
776366 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
776367 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
776368 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
776369 at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy
776370 but if things keep progressing between them they wont have a problem discussing it further down the track
776371 look this is what happens when you go against the theory of comparative advantage in a country like japan which in relative terms has lots of labor and little capital we shouldnt be producing things like motor cars which are very capital intensive in production
776372 dont tell us that you couldnt succeed because you didnt have help you had 25 years of very high tariff protection we kicked out all the foreign car makers 20 years ago and didnt let any of them in since then and back in 1949 this central bank even injected public money into toyota to save it from bankruptcy so please dont tell us that you couldnt succeed because you didnt have help because you had all the help you can ask for
776373 if i were his brother hed have to kill me
776374 in fact when he wrote about debt especially debt to the dead derrida came closest to revealing a unique strain of the
776375 when i say roland barthes it is certainly him whom i name him beyond his name but since he himself is now in accessible to this appellation it is him in me that i name toward him in me in you in us that i pass through his name
776376 political machines that disenfranchise racialized others leading to their civic death
776377 branding devices that lead to the accumulation of negative symbolic capital
776378 the prison contract and surplus punishment on angela y daviss abolitionsim
776379 imagine that inside someone is getting what they had coming to them mendieta 306
776380 w e are not looking down into the souls or at the predetermined qualities of groups when we observe these disparate patterns of behavior
776381 new institutions that lay claim to the space now occupied by the prison that can eventually start to crowd out the prison so that that it would inhabit increasingly smaller areas of our social and psychic landscape
776382 the consistent reduction in the numbers of people who are sent to prison with the ultimate aim of dismantling the prison system as the dominant mode of punishment
776383 immediately makes opponents of those who could potentially be allies
776384 the goal is not the abolition of prisons but their demotion
776385 long history of the exclusion of black and minorities from us society
776386 the problem isnt with neo liberalism its that we just arent being liberal enough do it right and everything will work out

776415 the nitrogen oxide diesel particulate matter and sulfur oxide emissions from some large ships headed to california ports are among the biggest contributors to a toxic stew permeating port communities the air board says the emissions are linked to asthma as well as respiratory and cardiac problems
776416 its one of the most significant regulations with respect to controlling air emissions thats been done in years
776417 the impact of these oceangoing vessels that are running up and down the coast is very very significant on california air quality no one disputes that

776431 if any group of aboriginals mixed or otherwise comes into the shop you will ask them to leave this does not include any customers of a long term basis say to them they are not be allowed in sic but can come in individually if they are willing to be searched on their way out
776432 if they ask why it is because of a recent spate of shoplifting involving people of their appearance if they start yelling or otherwise call the police

776438 with modern earth moving equipment and talented construction guys no longer is anybody intimidated by flat sites
776439 in florida and arizona theyre all flat ive been spoiled with some great sites in my career but im totally bullish on the new southwood
776440 everybody really liked his perspective on the overall design of the course his philosophy and how to tie this into the site and its history
776441 im not sure manitoba was ever on the radar screen
776442 its a mature market and not a growing market but i thought southwood was well organized and financed and they are pretty smart guys there they did a great deal with the university with great people and the right financing we could accomplish good things
776443 in my view this is totally capable of hosting a canadian open
776444 but we havent really talked about it because what im doing is building a club for members at southwood
776445 ask any of us if we prefer to leave here and i believe all of us would say no
776446 members generally live five to 10 minutes away this is a great location and location is a major consideration
776447 i think it was admitting we had some problems here really getting all the members to realize that reinvesting here didnt make as much sense as going for something that had a much bigger vision
776448 once they had all the facts people were able to understand it
776449 it is another example of hateful sexist language being used on the campaign trail and now is our moment to make it clear not on our watch the leadership of both parties must step up to condemn such hateful speech and demand apologies the obama campaign has criticized the lyrics but we call on the presumptive party nominee who is the celebrated subject of the new song to go even further publicly condemn the song demand an apology on behalf of the targets now
776450 this is not an issue of being pc politically correct
776451 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word

776457 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
776458 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
776459 turning cb1 back on and than treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention

776498 no lobbyists as such the war over software patents in the european union
776499 on july 6 2005 the world of politics turned upside down big money was dealt a blow the european parliament threw out legislation that the worlds largest it companies badly wanted under the pretext of protecting inventors against plagiarists it would have handed those giants sweeping powers over europes high tech markets an electronic roll call vote thwarted the wicked plan in a matter of seconds but that decision was preceded by years of intense fighting
776500 its quite a journey to observe and for the last couple of months ive been getting my hands dirty with the fawn as it finished the final stages of testing and in the process have been learning what is marks ubuntu in todays world of software it is more than apparent that its not what you know as it is often commoditized knowledge but what you do with what you know leaders in business and beyond often talk of empowerment how empowerment of the employee manager enables their business to grow and out perform if this empowerment were taken for granted what could one expect i often find myself sharing one particular thought in conversation these days age of participation
776501 weve calculated that we save 300 000 gallons of fresh water a year by using these toilets
776502 when you think about it its a real waste to use three to five gallons of water to flush away eight ounces of human waste but the best part is that were using waste as a resource
776503 the food waste and clipping are a huge source of lush green nitrogen then we mix them with leaves twigs and straw basically anything brown even unbleached paper products for carbon
776504 we turn the mixture every week and end up with 6 000 to 7 000 pounds of finished compost per year weve turned waste into a resource we could use way more compost on the course than that but weve made an 85 per cent reduction in what goes to landfill just by composting
776505 a golf course can be a wonderful habitat for wildlife
776506 weve now gone leaps and bounds beyond the audubon program
776507 one time a few years back we put it on just as a beautiful warm rain was beginning we sat back and thought this is going to be beautiful but then the rain stopped leaving all this gloppy muddy stuff on the greens golf balls picked it up as they rolled with a snowball effect golfers got it caked on their shoes in great big clumps it was a nightmare all we could we could do is apologize and hand out plastic bags
776508 a home lawn is so small it should be very easy to manage
776509 that dark dark blue green lawn is probably not very natural take a look around you at the colour of the leaves and whats around your site and try to make your yard fit in theres always going to be a weed seed that flies through the air or a bird that drops one on your lawn try to achieve a natural balance
776510 let the clippings fall on the lawn returning the nitrogen to the soil
776511 pick an organic fertilizer composted poultry litter is good because it has a low middle number the phosphorous lawns use the nitrogen first number and potassium third number efficiently but phosphorous can leach into nearby water causing problems
776512 also spoon feed your lawn if it says to use so much fertilizer divide that into four to five applications so if you get big rain the fertilizer wont all wash away
776513 if you can aerate your soil because it creates little channels for air water and nutrients to penetrate into the soil then fertilize after aerating for most home lawns even the aerating sandals will work if your yard is very compacted youll want to get an aerator that pulls the plugs right out
776514 hand pull weeds but once youve got them down to manageable level use corn gluten its a fertilizer but it also suppresses weed seed germination it suppresses all seed germination actually so dont use it on newly seeded lawns by fertilizing you get some fairly vigorous growth so the grass can compete with the weeds
776515 if you read no other posts noted in this carnival then do read this one

776521 i had a ski jacket on and iverson brought me winter gloves that i cherished
776522 when you keep telling people its going to rain all day they find other things to do
776523 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
776524 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next
776525 my compliments on a superb and extremely helpful web site to the best of my knowledge its only one of its kind that provides so much detailed information in one place for the clean air conscious traveler as a business editor for a florida daily newspaper i know quality of life and particularly air quality are critical factors for many high tech companies when they are scouting for locations to expand or start a new enterprise your site and links provide an outstanding portal into this expanding field of clean air consciousness keep up the excellent work

776535 i think that if you go back and look at us defensively to have a championship football team you cant give up big plays in a game
776536 the games that we lost last year we gave up too many 15 and 20 yard runs in the georgia game we gave up a 60 70 yard run in the lsu game on the last play of the game it was a 35 yard pass
776537 i mean in the past we have not given up big plays on defense
776538 you cant do that and get to atlanta now you can win games but for us you know were to the point now where we got to break that barrier and get to atlanta a little bit more often than what weve got in the last few years

776592 its not just about your knowledge and experience although they still are very important its really about an agents adaptability
776593 the most important question i ask is how do you want to be contacted

776595 the experienced professionals get most of their business from people who have done business with them already
776596 because the lender or agent did a superb job every time the client hears the word move or real estate they think of their professionals like you think of kleenex when youre about to sneeze

776601 how do you invest your most valuable asset time whats the roi
776602 with so much competition in the market one of the largest mistakes i see agents make is creating marketing just like everyone else

776614 o ne question remains why didnt mr obama leave his aides behind even the retired general and make the visit by himself
776615 having spent two years as the command sergeant major at landstuhl hospital i am always grateful for the attention that facility receives from members of congress
776616 senator obama has explained his decision to cancel a scheduled visit there by blaming the military which would not allow one of his political advisers to join him in a tour of the facility why senator obama felt he needed an adviser with him to visit u s troops is unclear but if senator obama isnt comfortable meeting wounded american troops without his entourage perhaps he does not have the experience necessary to serve as commander in chief
776617 mccain said he would fight to see those troops if it was him i see mccain would disobey the pentagon push in to see wounded troops in germany even if it compromised them wow now that is patriotism mccain style
776618 an analysis of federal records shows that the amount of money journalists contributed so far this election cycle favors democrats by a 15 1 ratio over republicans with 225 563 going to democrats only 16 298 to republicans two hundred thirty five journalists donated to democrats just 20 gave to republicans a margin greater than 10 to 1 an even greater disparity 20 to 1 exists between the number of journalists who donated to barack obama and john mccain
776619 assertions in early news reports that the pentagon had told mr obama he could not visit the medical center were incorrect said geoff morrell a pentagon spokesman he said the military personnel in germany had made arrangements for mr obamas visit and were surprised when it was called off
776620 yes even without cameras you and your ilk would claim obama is not sensitive to the needs of the military
776621 so rather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been considered a political controversy of some sort what we decided was that we not make a visit and instead i would call some of the troops that were there
776622 purpose in life is to try and spin anything and everything obama does into a negative
776623 you somehow think he suddenly decided that he wanted to deliberately disrespect the troops in germany
776624 its a fact that obama canceled a visit to landstuhl regional medical center at the last minute after planning it for weeks
776625 oh do we really want a president whose middle name is hussein
776626 block said the area where price was standing was restricted to members of the traveling national press corps that accompanies mccain on the campaign trail
776627 so what does the mccain camp have to gain by allowing black reporters access the nominee
776628 6 800 minority journalists gave a standing ovation to obama even though they were told not to
776629 one of the minority journalists in attendance said it was appropriate for journalists of color to
776630 it would be a smart move by mccain to restrict the access of black reporters theyre all voting for obama out of racial solidarity so what does the mccain camp have to gain by allowing black reporters access the nominee black reporters arent going to be objective so allowing them access can only cause damage
776631 black people are loud and all listen to gangsta rap and are therefore inferior
776632 watermelon is the fruit of inferior people black people like watermelon

776833 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
776834 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
776835 when attempts were made to have him exit and surrender to police were unsuccessful additional resources including the rcmp emergency response team and negotiator team were called in to assist
776836 he was immediately subdued and arrested without incident and is currently in rcmp custody
776837 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
776838 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
776839 due to the rural nature of our network airport type security is not practical its a very different type of system
776840 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
776841 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there

776894 product is seen or advertised on any tv show or network and sold by amazon com it can be merchandised to viewers through tivo
776895 if a guest on the daily show or oprah has a new book cd or dvd out you can purchase it on amazon com using your tivo remote without missing a second of tv whether the viewer is watching live or recorded

776898 now a record label can merchandise and sell a new artists cd on a show where the music is featured or a publisher can merchandise an authors book during a talk show when the author appears as a guest the marketing possibilities are endless
776899 a lot people in this industry have speculated that older people dont fast forward through programming as much because theyre not tech savvy or they believe early adopters are uber tivo users and never watch live tv or commercials
776900 what this data shows is that none of that is true people are fast forwarding and time shifting on an overall basis in the same amounts but what they time shift is really different
776901 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers

776907 the real id act establishes a new and privacy invasive national id card program by forcing states to standardize their drivers licenses and creating a vast national data base of private information on the citizenry the law establishes through the back door something americans would never have accepted directly a national identification card there was no open and honest vote on real id the mandate was slipped into a supplemental appropriations bill discouraging any real debate over the issue
776908 creating anything close to a national id card threatens americans basic civil liberties and privacy while doing little or nothing to make us more secure the legislation means higher fees longer lines and greater inconvenience for americans getting a drivers license the burden on states which have to redesign and remake state licenses and include all manner of information on citizens applying for new drivers licenses would be extremely high and immensely costly since they would have to restructure computer databases security systems verification measures and more

777012 this is a fantastic day for the green party and will help ensure we have a party that is understandable recognisable and effective but we now need to demonstrate to all our members regardless of which way they voted that this is not about weakening our principles its about strengthening our effectiveness
777013 the result of this referendum challenges the party to create a leadership structure that is true to green ideals it has put our future leaders on notice that the membership expects a more focussed more effective party with a leadership team that is truly accountable to the membership in a real and effective manner
777014 the referendum was an excellent example of democracy in action

777022 i tell you guys ive been seeing more and more bodies coming down the river all with their faces practically scraped off that would be bad enough but the last three that have shown up all had this weird tattoo on their necks his majesty specifically said to keep it quiet because he didnt want the people to panic over the idea of a cult lurking nearby he doesnt want another witch hunt the official cause is that meat eating fish upstream are eating the softer parts of the flesh but that torn flesh wasnt nibbled off it was sliced off

777039 there is always a lot going on in the government we are constantly working to improve the effectiveness and efficiencies in delivering quality programs and services to canadians
777040 the government of canada is working to improve accountability through transparency enhancing the collective ability to manage and reallocate resources improving the quality and reliability of information to support decision making and its management practices as well as streamlining its processes policies and administrative functions we are doing this through a number of initiatives such as the federal accountability act which brought forward specific measures to help strengthen accountability and oversight in government operations the corporate administrative shared services initiative which helps us identify opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of corporate administrative processes such as finance hr and material management and services government wide it shared service organization whose mission is to be the government of canadas centre of excellence for the delivery of it infrastructure solutions to federal institutions they have the mission to consolidate the it infrastructure of the government of canada current emphasis is on data centres desktop and network services a policy suite renewal initiative which is an effort to streamline our policies standards and guidelines while at the same time clarifying responsibilities and accountabilities within government an expenditure management system renewal which is an effort to streamline our budget and management processes to ensure our focus is on maximized results for resources expended better outcomes for our investment dollar and the management accountability framework which sets out the treasury boards expectations of public service managers especially deputy heads for good public service management measure the management performance of government organizations
777041 getting things to work together in such a diverse array of initiatives is not easy for our part were starting to introduce some of our ea tools to support these initiatives as well as our improve existing management practices in particular we are rolling out gsrm governments of canada strategic reference model and btep business transformation enablement program where and when it makes sense
777042 btep is essentially a collection of best practices knitted together around a common structure and language for the business of government that common language is gsrm which is a public sector business driven model that was developed by municipalities years ago some of these municipalities like peel and the city of winnipeg used it called mrm municipal services reference model to better understand their expenditures and results it allowed cities to compare their results to each other it allowed a better understanding between investment and outcome years later provinces began to leverage the model adding their unique features to handle the services of provincial governments calling their model psrm public service reference model the province of ontario was a leader in this space about 5 years ago we started work to extend the model for the federal government the model was missing a few elements national defense as one example but the basic constructs were the same it was at this time that the idea that a method based on the reference models took hold
777043 think about the bridge you drive home on last night as a user you care about certain things where is it how many lanes is it slippery when wet and generally how it looks you trust that people with engineering and architecture degrees built it safely when those people get together they will talk about the bridge using terms from the fields of civil engineering e g statics and dynamics and they will talk about coefficients of elasticity tensile strength of steel etc the argument i make is that business is complicated like a bridge it takes real science to architect and engineer it precision around the language of business design is necessary the same way it is necessary for the bridge within this context gsrm and btep were first written for the architect community of practice not the end users moving forward as ea matures as a recognized best practice increasingly we are seeing the executive and business owner groups look to common consistent program service information technology and organization design guided by best practices like those embodied with ea
777044 for years cios as a profession have been working on capturing business in order to build systems capture business design systems to do this the profession has come up with tools and methods to help with the process of capturing the business in order to build systems these tools are pretty powerful then something strange happened somebody somewhere made the leap from capture business design systems to capture business design business these methods and tools became business capable and business centric that is the common languages we are discussing today would be used not for the sake of building some it solution instead we do it simply to design better business answering questions like what do we do why do we do it who benefits and how much does that outcome cost this idea is not all new but there are things that make it different the models tools forms etc of this new approach form a type of science it is holistic it is powerful this advancement might be seen as the pivotal change in business it relationship but it also and more importantly a vital tool for business designs
777045 how about this as a vision business program service experts plan and design their programs services processes and clearly identify outputs outcomes target groups etc using a set of tools and methods they are experts with their processes are detailed their job descriptions are synchronized with the processes citizens can understand their services and how other services within link to what they see business experts do all of this then one day the business people decide the want to automate something and need to adjust an it enabled part of the business instead of relying on the interview process the it people pick up the designs from a tool they also know that which was previously gathered in an interview is now already there because the business experts needed it there to design their processes services etc thats simply the business being better able to deal with it folks the real interesting challenge is business people speaking to business people it is a common occurrence to have programs looks at clients in completely different ways when we start projects with multiple jurisdictions we see even more challenges for interconnections that is why gsrm is critical it forces each player to look at the business through a different set of terms and within a rigorous common reference model and structure but after a few exercises the participants will begin to see connections they never knew were there the btep method helps get through this initial hump it is like many other strategic planning methods the difference is that btep uses a common language and very strong structure
777046 well let me tell you a real story i attended a meeting where ken cochrane our cio was asked his opinion about the technology required to resolve this huge business issue involving billions of dollars of program delivery ken was asked to talk about recommended solution approaches the conversation revolved around technology managing large technology projects service oriented architecture erps data centres software etc then it was time for ken to speak for the next hour we talked about business requirements business design principles service design service standards outcomes and designs with well understood recipients we talked about business design and processes yes we would help but we would help by asking our business scientists to work with the business owners we would not address business questions with technology answers
777047 we must start to address these bigger issues it starts i believe in understanding your business like a builder understands a bridge not how a driver understands a bridge

777074 while im delighted that both tories and lib dems have decided to make climate change a key policy battle ground in the next election i remain a little under whelmed at their proposals and lack of commitment to the issue while the lib dems have opted for unrealistic optimism over the reality of experience calling for a zero carbon britain by 2050 when their record in power at all levels is one of supporting both airport expansion and more road building the tories have already insisted any leaked proposals from them do not represent party policy the truth is that we cant cut emissions sufficiently by tinkering around the edges of society we will only reach a zero carbon society as we must if we are to avert the worst impacts of climate change by changing the very ways we do business live our lives and measure progress now that would be a truly radical proposition as long as the other parties remain committed to economic growth at all costs and ever freer international trade this necessary radicalism seems far from their thinking whatever their leaders are saying this week only the green party recognises that if policies to address climate change require a different economic paradigm then thats to be welcomed since the kind of materialism that is currently driven by contemporary consumer capitalism is leaving people unfulfilled as well as destroying the planet far from being a sacrifice a zero carbon society will be a healthier happier society with warmer homes better public transport stronger local communities more green jobs and more free time put simply the policies we need to live good lives are precisely the policies we need to tackle climate change and that is what we need to articulate if we are to have any chance of achieving a zero carbon britain

777177 the cia ufos mj 12 jfk amp james jesus angleton
777178 a s far as i know this burned memo is the only document that ive ever heard anyone claim could be the authorization to kill president john f kennedy
777179 in 1967 i was asked by my boss to look into ufos because he had to give a speech on the subject and that assignment resulted in my establishing a group of about five scientists who studied the ufo subject for a couple of years thats when i met james mcdonald ph d
777180 my science team at mcdonnell douglas did not discover the secret of anti gravity but we worked on it stanton friedman nuclear physicist and long time ufo investigator was one of the contributors to our work
777181 in the meantime i learned that timothy coopers father harry bob cooper was assigned to holloman afb in the late 1940s and one of the jobs he had was to run their reprographics facility document printing and copying
777182 perhaps the most stunning physical evidence for the existence of the top secret majic program is this original 339 page manuscript about flying saucers
777183 the author was charles vernon bowen who in 1961 produced a manuscript entitled encyclopaedia of flying saucers then a friend of bowens in the u s air force asked to show bowens manuscript to some u s air force authority and some one there apparently gave it to someone else in the u s army because it was returned from the foia office at fort meade in 1999 to timothy cooper charles vernon bowen was an advertising agent who spent most of his lunch time in the new york public library looking up everything in the periodical guide to literature on ufos and flying saucers his encyclopaedia was basically an unclassified summary of everything he had read were not sure where exactly his manuscript went in the government but we do know there were people actively reading it because they were writing on the margins ive analyzed the age of the ink when those marginalia occurred the earliest date is 1961 and those were the ink marks made by vernon bowen the last marks he made on the manuscript other ink margin notes are dated 1977 the interesting thing is that the notes made in the margins of this original manuscript were datable by pen and ink and some of the notes identified harvard astronomer donald menzel as a guy who was a member of the inner government ufo circle editors note donald howard menzel april 11 1901 to december 14 1976 an american astronomer and astrophysicist who was one of the leading astronomers of his era menzel also earned notoriety as an early skeptic of ufos reported that his own research including examination of harvard university archives showed that menzel had served as a consultant to the national security council the fact that menzel had security clearance and worked with the u s government is not on its own extraordinary many scientists participate in sensitive duties for the u s government what is somewhat unusual about menzels case is that he held the rarefied top secret ultra clearance menzels dual membership in the academic community and in the black world of military secret projects was apparently unknown to many colleagues and military contacts in the usaf air technical intelligence center friedman argues that menzels high level clearance is evidence that he was a member of mj 12 in fact friedman found menzels name on a list of purported mj 12 members friedman then concluded that menzels persistent debunking of the ufo phenomenon was a deliberate mj 12 assignment to misinform and reduce public and professional interest in ufos vernon bowens encyclopaedia is significant in that its one of only two or three documents i have that are on original paper where you can actually date the paper and ink and determine it was authentic for that era when did you receive the pages for the first time that you could study the ink i think i saw it for the first time probably a week after he got it in june 1999 but i got possession of the documents in 2001 when timothy cooper became disenchanted with the ufo subject wanted to become a tv script writer and was really short of cash i asked him how much would it take to buy from you everything youve got he agreed on a price and he shipped me the documents www majesticdocuments com came into being after you purchased all of the documents that timothy cooper had in 2001 yes and interestingly enough one week after i had been at his big bear lake california home and saw the vernon bowen inked manuscript with the top secret majic stamp on the title page i received an email from timothy saying you wont believe what arrived in the mail yesterday then he alluded to the fact that a new memo he just received had apparently been scorched in a fire thats when i first heard about the burned memo as far as i know this burned memo is the only document that ive ever heard anyone claim could be the authorization to kill president john f kennedy

777187 your low doses over time assertion has been repeatedly falsified by empirical studies
777188 the scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial
777189 the health risks particularly the development of solid cancers in organs rise proportionally with exposure at low doses of radiation the risk of inducing solid cancers is very small as the overall lifetime exposure increases so does the risk

777192 im gymnasium lernte ich die sharia das islamische recht 1996 ich war gerade 18 wurde ich von den israelischen verteidigungsstreitkr ften verhaftet weil ich der vorsitzende der islamischen gesellschaft in meinem gymnasium war es ist eine art jugendbewegung der organisation damit begann mein erweckungsprozess bis dahin kannte ich die hamas ber meinen vater der ein sehr bescheidenes und liebevolles leben f hrte zuerst bewunderte ich die organisation weil ich meinen vater so sehr bewunderte aber w hrend der 16 monate die ich im gef ngnis verbrachte war ich dem wahren gesicht der hamas ausgeliefert es ist eine negative organisation ganz einfach eine grunds tzlich b se organisation ich sa im gef ngnis von megiddo und verstand pl tzlich wer die wirkliche hamas war ihre f hrer im gef ngnis hatten bessere bedingungen so etwa das beste essen und auch mehr familienbesuche und handt cher f r die dusche diese leute haben keine moral keine integrit t aber sie sind nicht so dumm wie die fatah die am helllichten tag vor jedermanns augen stiehlt und sofort der korruption verd chtigt wird die leute von der hamas erhalten ihr geld auf unehrliche weise investieren es an geheimen orten und legen nach au en eine einfache lebensf hrung an den tag fr her oder sp ter verwenden sie das geld und legen die leute rein
777193 ich respektiere israel und bewundere es als staat ich bin gegen jede politik die zivilisten ermordet oder sie als mittel zum zweck missbraucht und ich verstehe dass israel das recht dazu hat sich selbst zu verteidigen wenn die pal stinenser keinen feind zum bek mpfen haben bek mpfen sie sich untereinander in etwa 20 jahren werden sie sich an das erinnern was ich ihnen sage der konflikt wird zwischen verschiedenen gruppierungen innerhalb der hamas stattfinden sie fangen schon jetzt an ber die kontrolle der finanzen zu streiten
777194 ihr juden solltet aufpassen ihr werdet nie niemals frieden mit der hamas haben der islam als die ideologie die sie leitet wird ihnen nicht erlauben ein friedensabkommen mit den juden zu schlie en sie glauben dass die berlieferung sagt dass der prophet mohammed gegen die juden gek mpft hat und man sie daher weiter bek mpfen muss bis zum tod sie m ssen rache an jedem nehmen der den propheten mohammed nicht akzeptiert hat wie die juden die im koran als affen und s hne von schweinen betrachtet werden sie sprechen in begriffen historischer rechte die ihnen genommen wurden in den augen der hamas widerspricht ein frieden mit israel der sharia und dem koran und die juden haben kein recht in pal stina zu bleiben

777208 lenders assume that the future will be much like the past if there is a problem with loan defaults the assumption is made that higher defaults are likely to be temporary but models based on this assumption are faulty because resource shortages peak oil etc are likely to raise the price of all types of energy products and food year after year this will tend to cause progressively more loan defaults because people will have less and less money available to repay loans after buying basic necessities failure of financial markets to recognize the increasing risk of defaults due to resource depletion can be expected to result in a consistent underpricing of risk individuals and institutions owning debt based financial products are likely to suffer huge losses year after year

777220 her experimental work fell out of fashion following the advent of the synthesizer but in recent years she has enjoyed a revival of interest especially among bands like the chemical brothers and portishead to whom she is a legendary figure
777221 the material had languished unheard for 30 years until it was passed to manchester universitys school of art histories and culture to catalogue and preserve the material in poor condition had to be played on a 1960s studer a80 tape machine lent by the bbcs manchester studios before it could be digitised

777228 the goal is to learn the sources of structure and understand mechanism
777229 it is one of humanitys most enduring spiritual traditions the idea that all life or all consciousness is interconnected human groups whether ethnic religious or racial as various as the iroquois the sufis and western european freemasons all incorporate it into their belief structures references to it can be found in ancient documents of the classical world both east and west it is a very compelling idea spanning both millennia and the vast complexity of human cultures yet as compelling as the concept is emotionally only in recent decades has any objective evidence emerged that such a construct might be valid even this work in fields as various as physics parapsychology and biology has provided only suggestions largely because the research was not conceived in global terms but instead focused on more limited vistas indeed much of the relevant research has regarded only individual performances in experiments on anomalies such as telepathy mind matter interactions and distant healing somewhat broader vistas are opened in studies of group resonance and morphogenetic fields

777231 we have a habit in writing articles published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as possible to cover up all the tracks to not worry about the blind alleys or describe how you had the wrong idea first and so on

777233 although information will be presented with the scientific rigor that is required for accuracy and clarity the site is intended also to have a strong artistic and aesthetic presence we expect to use music and dynamic images both for background and for display of information and we will provide links to a variety of articles and scholarly resources we believe important aspects of the project may be represented in stories poetry and philosophy including selected readings from henri bergson teilhard de chardin carl jung and others who have thought deeply about consciousness for example one of the guiding models for this project is teilhards idea of a noosphere or layer of intelligence enveloping the earth and his description of mankinds evolution toward a destiny to fulfill that role while this metaphor is more spiritual than scientific it provides a very interesting interpretive background one of several that we may consider for our specific scientific questions a few examples of aesthetic expressions of the projects philosophy and mission are given in our even the scientific data sometimes create immediately meaningful pictures as in the beautifully symmetrical traces that appear to note the death of our friend and reg host in new zealand

777275 what is hard for canadians to understand as it is for the public in the rest of the western countries is just how big the development task is here
777276 this is an extremely underdeveloped country its the most underdeveloped country i have worked in and it has had 30 years of war
777277 we have had a tough summer both in terms of kabul and kandahar in terms of security incidents
777278 when we have setbacks its too easy to think that any bad day ruins whole years of work and thats just not true
777279 when we look five years later at kabul city or kandahar city and there are tin stores with a paved road with some basic lighting selling some basic things well into the evening that actually is a sign of recovery and success but it may not look like it if were expecting a higher level of development i think thats the hard part for people to understand just how basic it is and how difficult the challenge is to move this community to get around 30 years of war
777280 our development program is going to continue and that means our development work will continue so i think we need to look at how thats going to take shape in 2011
777281 development assistance is very dependent on security but its not dependent just on canadians providing security
777282 canada has projects in the north in the east in the west of this country where were implementing projects where other troops are actually providing the security so lets not forget that we work throughout the country not just where we have canadian soldiers
777283 but they should be proud of what canada is doing here

777288 i played great i really played well i played great today i felt like i should have shot 63 or 64 had countless birdie opportunities from 6 to 15 feet and then i make three bogeys on the last four holes and turn a 64 into a 70
777289 so i feel like im playing well i just need to get that final piece of scoring down
777290 maybe i hit it straighter than i used to maybe im smarter i dont know its definitely not smarter
777291 i played great all week all week long and then today i make a couple mistakes in the back nine and when i start to make bogey i cant stop i start to make bogey bogey bogey greg norman played the masters he start to make a bogey he never stopped i remember about it but after that i make a good putt on the 15 and talked with my caddy i said we have to make one par thats all we will make and then we make a par on 15 and i start to finish with par

777297 the current web is a web of text and pictures
777298 data is everywhere but most of it is locked in inaccessible databases behind websites locked within documents or held within silos so it cant be linked to related data elsewhere
777299 it realises the vision for interoperability between data sources on the web and it gives the data meaning in a way that computers can understand and reason with it
777300 i have a dream for the web in which computers become capable of analysing all the data on the web the content links and transactions between people and computers
777301 now the semantic web is taking off for real with billions of facts available scale is becoming a problem
777302 the tools we have are fine for small scale applications but we need large scale infrastructure to break away from toy applications
777303 a new technology that rates web pages rather than use keywords and number of links to the page the wisdom of crowds searchmonkey finds web pages using the semantic markup that is embedded in the page the wisdom of authors this creates a substantial motive for adding semantic markup search engine optimization
777304 well yes my young samurai you want to write material that your audience desires if you want to reach a limitless audience then you need to write about subjects that always interest a lot of people
777305 sensei i want to have lots of readers i want to be the next stephen king james patterson or heather armstrong help me noble one to be a popular writer online
777306 yours is a worthy endeavor young one so i will tell you the secret to conquering a large audience you must use keyword analysis to find the water for which readers thirst the secret to writing success is to find a topic or keyword that people are searching for but that isnt already covered by too many other writers the warriors who are your competition google keyword tool to search for keyword ideas but now young seeker i will give you a mighty new weapon that will harness the power of the internet and the google so that you too will be invincible online market samurai
777307 weve got all the pieces to be able to go ahead and do pretty much everything you should be able to implement a huge amount of the dream we should be able to get huge benefits from interoperability using what weve got so people are realizing its time to just go do it
777308 theres a movement called linked open data which is to put up information about different artists and songs and cds
777309 theres another site which has got data about different places and another site which has got data about famous people and where they were born now take that data which is public data out there on the semantic web so you can now write a program or make a mash up site which will do things like play me all the tracks by singers who were born within a hundred miles of where i was born or something
777310 around the web itself there are lots of different disciplines in which people are investigating the web playing with the web doing new bits of the web but the study of the web itself what were calling web science isnt really established as a discipline so thats something were trying to do
777311 consumers dont dislike advertising they dislike bad and irrelevant advertising
777312 we believe its important to expose our residents to life after the grove living here is pretty sweet with no worries about roommates not paying rent or bills and the luxury of having a full amenity package at their fingertips we dont want them having total culture shock when its time to enter the real world
777313 we know college is stressful so we help balance that stress with a lot of fun we put together themed parties like peace love grove event where students wear tie dyed grove shirts love beads and participate in green days
777314 other ways we help residents relax are through fitness classes pool parties monday night football parties and movie nights
777315 our events are successful because they are led and organized by our community assistants peers attending the same university when residents feel a part of something they are more likely to stay where they are making our residents better makes the grove a better place
777316 one way we help residents is through designing programs to help them look at things from a different vantage point for example in one of our past events residents helped blow up hot air balloons and took tethered balloon rides illustrating how different things look when you see them from a new perspective

777332 i know there is a sword above your head and that it may fall at any moment but why should that trouble you i have a sword over my head all the time i am every moment in dread lest something may cause me to lose my life

777347 we found a small laminated and hinged cabinet which was probably a vattern bathroom cabinet 33x35x37cm we then bought two extra flat laminated panels at 1 euro each 1 in black and one in white to create the missing side wall and oven top
777348 searching for a desk for my workplace was very hard and i could not find anything which fitted my new appartment
777349 ive finally gotten a chance to take pictures of my beauuutiful new slipcover i tried to get bubo in the pics with the couch but id just used the vacuum cleaner and he was hiding on top of my expedit bookcase thanks again for this wonderful contest and for helping my new apartment look so good
777350 all i did was saw the birch level with a miter saw drill a 12mm hole through the middle and inserted the light fixture i also sanded the top and added felt to the bottom
777351 i actually used two ikea lamps in the process i disassembled one lamp from its arm then i took the metal clip base off of another metal lamp cant find it on the site anymore and screwed the loop at the bottom into the metal arm then i screwed a clipboard into the side of the arm
777352 its a lamp ive made using the grundtal lamp base and skimra shade
777353 it has cut outs that cast light onto the wall and ceiling in a sort of not terribly exciting light show weirdly enough it also features bugs
777354 i think they were intended as drawer pulls or maybe refrigerator handles they were only 49 and using a hacksaw i was in business they were too long for what i needed so i cut off about 3
777355 i originally bought only one and it looked really sparse so i decided to increase it this involves three rimfrost pendant lamp shades i stared with a wooden disk and tin material that i got from the hardware store the tin comes in different patterns the pattern i picked had small holes all over it making it easy to put the screws thru and the nails to hold it into place wrapped the edge of the wooden disk edge with the tin leaving a inch extra on the top to make room for the wires put small nails thru the tin holes to hold the edge on then cut out a circle of the tin material to cover the bottom of the disk spaced out three holes for the wires and used the ceiling clips loops to hold the wires above and in place wires are hemma with the plug cut off and spliced to connect to the ceiling wires wired the three lamps into the one switched outlet and put large screws 6 of them up thru the disk directly into the ceiling to hold it into place voila an inexpensive chandelier
777356 all it took was removing the original lampshade of the not cutting the wire in the smaller opening of the regolit the one on the downside when used as a pendant lamp to make room for the lightbulb putting that side on top of the not and then fixing it there with some adhesive tape
777357 the globe fit perfectly and gives a very nice glow i also combined the lamps to get the look of a street lamp
777358 the love of god has been poured into our hearts by the holy spirit who has been given to us
777359 abba father i am yours and you are mine forever
777360 do not grieve the holy spirit of god by whom you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise
777361 the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the lord
777362 as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god
777363 on the top there is enough space to decorate it with some flowers etc under the cage you find a drawer where you can store everything you need for your pets also the forvar jar from ikea is a wonderful sand bath and helps to keep the environment clean thanks to my boyfriend sven these racks are a wonderful adventure playground for the four clowns
777364 we got a small bookcase from ikea and drilled holes into the sides of it we then slipped a curtain rod through the holes and created a small closet type setup for our babys room we can take out the shelves as he gets bigger but for now its incredibly wonderful to have we use the knobs on the outside to hang his bath towels simple but perfect for us
777365 you cant deny though that there are a couple of sectarians and nutters in the west
777366 yeah thats great true opposition is always non parliamentary its good i wasnt admitted into parliament

777369 i have to tell you dear comrades that i would ideally be a communist but i dont want you to think of stalin or something im thinking of karl marx
777370 yeah i have to tell you too ideally i would be a social democrat but i dont want you to think of scharping im of course thinking of august bebel
777371 you know ive always thought the same way ive always tried to find the pigeonhole for myself and told the media who said perhaps i was a social democrat yes but if so then like august bebel i know all of that i dont think it gets us anywhere they are twentieth century pigeonholes we need to get rid of now we are the new left of the 21 st century and we dont need them any more we need to answer the questions of our century and then we will become a new force
777372 im interested in your relationship to representative democracy that means that different interests ought to be represented in the bundestag four parties say pensions from 67 cdu fdp spd and greens 77 of the population are against pensions from 67 that means they do not want these 77 percent to be represented with their argument in the bundestag the real scandal is that only one party represents these 77 percent in the bundestag
777373 that does not mean at all that the last answer of history is capitalism
777374 we have transformed a cheap ceiling lamp melodi into a work lamp we only needed a longer cable and a curtain rail
777375 we recently hacked an ikea lamp taking a picture of our beloved astroboy we used posterazor to enlarge and print it on sheets of backlit film for inkjet printers from folex then attached the sheets to the lamp frame using photoclips and some nylon thread easy but fiddly
777376 there are very few people who realize what god would make of them if they abandoned themselves into gods hands and let themselves be formed by gods grace
777377 im standing out there with my 4 year old son and theres this giant rat standing about four feet away from us
777378 just looking at us in broad daylight as if it were a pet
777379 kind of climbed up on the boxes off the ground and sort of watched this thing just nonchalantly walk around inside my garage and onto my yard
777380 you start to realize that as you go to that property wait a minute
777381 you couldnt see in any of the windows i dont know if it was tarp but it wasnt just curtains it was blacked out you couldnt see in the house the front door was rotted

777386 show me a sane man and i will cure him for you
777387 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
777388 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement

777393 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way
777394 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
777395 okay the times gave him the rope and he hung himself
777396 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
777397 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds

777400 y dijo pedro anan as por qu llen satan s tu coraz n para que mintieses al esp ritu santo y sustrajeses del precio de la heredad no has mentido a los hombres sino a dios

777402 el esp ritu mismo da testimonio a nuestro esp ritu de que somos hijos de dios
777403 mas el consolador el esp ritu santo a quien el padre enviar en mi nombre l os ense ar todas las cosas y os recordar todo lo que yo os he dicho
777404 porque todos los que son guiados por el esp ritu de dios stos son hijos de dios
777405 digo pues andad en el esp ritu y no satisfag is los deseos de la carne
777406 y de igual manera el esp ritu nos ayuda en nuestra debilidad pues qu hemos de pedir como conviene no lo sabemos pero el esp ritu mismo intercede por nosotros con gemidos indecibles
777407 y si el esp ritu de aquel que levant de los muertos a jes s mora en vosotros el que levant de los muertos a cristo jes s vivificar tambi n vuestros cuerpos mortales por su esp ritu que mora en vosotros
777408 pero recibir is poder cuando haya venido sobre vosotros el esp ritu santo y me ser is testigos en jerusal n en toda judea en samaria y hasta lo ltimo de la tierra
777409 ahora bien hay diversidad de dones pero el esp ritu es el mismo porque a ste es dada por el esp ritu palabra de sabidur a a otro palabra de ciencia seg n el mismo esp ritu a otro fe por el mismo esp ritu y a otro dones de sanidades por el mismo esp ritu a otro el hacer milagros a otro profec a a otro discernimiento de esp ritus a otro diversos g neros de lenguas y a otro interpretaci n de lenguas

777412 sed llenos del esp ritu hablando entre vosotros con salmos con himnos y c nticos espirituales cantando y alabando al se or en vuestros corazones dando siempre gracias por todo al dios y padre en el nombre de nuestro se or jesucristo
777413 pero cuando venga el esp ritu de verdad l os guiar a toda la verdad porque no hablar por su propia cuenta sino que hablar todo lo que oyere y os har saber las cosas que habr n de venir l me glorificar porque tomar de lo m o y os lo har saber todo lo que tiene el padre es m o por eso dije que tomar de lo m o y os lo har saber
777414 cu nto m s vuestro padre celestial dar el esp ritu santo a los que se lo pidan
777415 ellos despu s de haberle adorado volvieron a jerusal n con gran gozo y estaban siempre en el templo alabando y bendiciendo a dios am n
777416 vino sobre ellos el esp ritu santo y hablaban en lenguas

777421 you have to scrap that because youve got to have time
777422 and that is exactly what politics is all about the judgment you bring to make decisions
777423 and the truth is that weve got a bunch of smart people i think who know ten times more than we do about the specifics of the topics and so if what youre trying to do is micromanage and solve everything then you end up being a dilettante but you have to have enough knowledge to make good judgments about the choices that are presented to you
777424 how long does it take to do nothing 1 billion times

777427 here is my conversion of the pantry in our newly acquired but small home in ontario canada i used three akurum high cabinets with the arlig doors the cabinets had to be reduced in depth from 12 inches to 7 inches to fit flush into the available space my wife helped me with the long cuts on the table saw the three pictures show the space as we took possession of it the interim period and finally the finished product the surrounding walls are still undergoing transformation and hence the unfinished look
777428 we got the boy a set of finger puppets from ikea which are cute but of course small so they would inevitably be lost plus little hands sometimes have a problem with getting the puppets on their fingers to play with them so we came up with the idea of a schoolbus with wood dowels where the puppets could live

777432 i also wanted there to be a gap between the desktop and the base cabinets so i could use the space as extra storage i tend to have piles of paper on my desk and i wanted to be able to tuck them away neatly without actually putting them in a drawer or cabinet i had some old west elm modular storage furniture already so i decided to use these as the base i took four of the square cabinet components used in two sets fastened each set together in the back and added extra re enforcement to the bottom of both by hammering an extra board beneath each set then i added four 6

777434 when revamping my workspace a few weeks ago and not in the mood to unscrew my jerker desk by hand i thought i might try sacrificing one of the countless hand wrenches ive picked up from ikea in a perfect world i would have had a drill bit exactly sized for the hex screws used in the desks fixtures but alas such things escape my grasp so i took the freebie hex wrench cut it at the straightest edge i could manage with the bolt cutters and slid the new bit into the chuck of the power drill it held in there just fine and i had my desk in pieces in minutes i imagine that this technique isnt limited to just this driver but to any and all ikea wrenches and hand drivers from the s shapes to the ls

777454 i love tea in a teapot and its hard to find a good well padded tea cosy in the us so a few years ago i started making my own usually i make them from scratch but it occurred to me that i could use these ikea potholders that had been lying around unused they were too big as potholders but worked fine for an individual teapot cosy 1 i unpicked the binding off 3 of the 4 edges of both the squares 2 i cut each square into a bulbous semi circular shape keeping the binding attached on one potholder cutting it off on the other 3 i joined the 2 semicircles together at their round sides by fitting the attached binding over both of them and sewing together i actually had to hand sew this part as my sewing machine wasnt up to the thickness so this was the most time consuming part about an hour i also made a little loop at the end with some of the extra binding theres a lot left over because i like to hang my cosies up on hooks in the kitchen and there you have a teacosy you can compare with another cosy i made previously and with a small teapot for size actually this cosy is not quite as effective at heat conservation as my regular ones since its not quite as well padded but it was so easy to make and cute that its fine

777665 paul is a talented songwriter hes got a force of nature behind him he will carry on regardless
777666 he is still creating music thats getting people talking it is testimony to his talent hes like a bob dylan or van morrison
777667 he will never put out a really awful record he knows how to write a good song he knows what works
777668 out of all the punk scene he is the one that has proved himself who would have thought he would be the one he has an obsession with music
777669 you could never imagine bruce foxton and rick buckler from the jam allowing music to dominate their lives in the way it has shaped pauls life
777670 he would literally change his life around a record like he did with the style council

777682 paul can be the devil and then an angel he can be really spot on but equally he can be quite difficult
777683 if you look at dylan or van morrison you can imagine them having the same lifestyle hes a mystic poet wrapped up in a hooligans coat
777684 he can be effing and blinding and then come out with these beautiful songs about rustic scenes

777887 what im trying to figure out is do i believe its the eighth of july and not the eighth of june
777888 i cant believe all this snow its pretty incredible for the middle of july
777889 all frozen over just ice everywhere i guess its not a normal july
777890 but i wouldnt call it abnormal either weve had some snow up here in the past as i recall
777891 its been an exceptional melt year not an exceptional snow year
777892 the total snowfall wasnt that impressive but it just didnt melt out its really persisted
777893 hazardous conditions steep snow slopes ice axe and crampons recommended
777894 campground is unrecognizable and covered by five feet of snow
777895 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
777896 i was dismayed to discover that the ipccs 2001 and 2007 reports did not devote chapters to the central climate sensitivity question and did not explain in proper systematic detail the methods by which they evaluated it when i began to investigate it seemed that the ipcc was deliberately concealing and obscuring its method
777897 in the past 70 years the sun was more active than at almost any other time in the past 11 400 years mars jupiter neptunes largest moon and pluto warmed at the same time as earth

777900 all right you can get a rabbit on the condition that if it doesnt work out after a few weeks the person you buy it from takes it back
777901 pet animals are gifts that parents provide for their children and that we end up taking care of them is all part of the gift
777902 nowadays we think of a philanthropist as someone who donates big sums of money yet the word is derived from two greek words philos loving and anthropos man loving man all of us are capable of being philanthropists we can give of ourselves
777903 its a rewarding experience to serve someone sometimes we are the only people that these folks see all day
777904 we used to go to five or six people now we just go to three the others have gone elsewhere or to hospices
777905 its possible the situation will get quite a bit worse mr chaney said yesterday
777906 very strong shape and a downgrade of the companys credit rating is ill advised
777907 we certainly dont believe any downgrade would be appropriate he said
777908 the banks in very strong shape and at an operating level things are going extremely well but thats a matter for us to sit down and talk to the ratings agencies with and to assure them thats the case
777909 when you get people to notice your brand or product in store the intent to buy will always be much higher
777910 competing with global blue chip brands with large advertising budgets can be difficult but in the end its the quality of the software and the service you provide to customers that shines through and not the hype future media needed a solution that was powerful and scalable enough to run a truly huge network and yet not require a team of it professionals to run it we were delighted when future media chose our technology after almost a year of careful research the size of this deployment is truly impressive our technology will deliver content news and advertising to 100 million viewers annually thats comfortably greater than most national broadcasters and is a testament to the growing reach of out of home digital
777911 we are pleased with the support rendered to us by ryarc in terms of flexibility amp software customization
777912 we are extremely satisfied with campaignmanagers features functionality and robustness its outstanding user friendly interface isolates the user from all complexities our test runs have all been successful with no software glitches

777921 a weakened anglican communion or church of england does not help the proclamation of the christian faith
777922 prayers for the success of the lambeth conference are so important i encourage catholics to remember the archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams and all those attending the lambeth conference
777923 world youth day in sydney has shown the vitality of the catholic church and its young people i very much hope the anglican communion can draw strength from these catholic traditions and the assurance of prayers from pope benedict xvi
777924 move much closer to the industry average in the coming months
777925 policy of rapid movement towards recovery where it is clear the borrower will not maintain payments and where we have higher risk
777926 this is the biggest amount of fraud that hits the banks mortgage atm and credit card fraud is committed by criminals but this is white collar fraudsters they are not drug dealers just commercial rascals but this will become a bigger issue in about 12 months as we head in to a downturn expect to see some very large frauds
777927 banks credit committees often dont want to admit they have been defrauded
777928 in the last downturn one bank gave a jordanian lecturer 130m to build homes he built a few and then went off with the money they never saw him again
777929 as we head into a downturn the deception and fraud gets exposed also banks start asking more awkward questions as they want to check their provisions in a boom they are less worried about that
777930 pressures for higher rates are likely to linger on the committee overall we cannot entirely rule out the risk that the committee will sanction higher rates this time
777931 inflationary pressures continue to prevent the mpc from cutting rates in response to the deteriorating real economy in fact if interest rates change this month they are more likely to go up than down
777932 what we have to guard against is the persistence of inflation and a little more action now could mean we are all better off in the end
777933 as history has shown perhaps if a little more was done in the 1970s or even a lot more we may have avoided many of the issues that we faced for almost 20 years
777934 zeitgeist was created as a not for profit expression to inspire people to start looking at the world from a more critical perspective and to understand that very often things are not what the population at large think they are
777935 as history has shown perhaps if a little more was done in the 1970s or even a lot more we may have avoided many of the issues that we faced for almost 20 years once inflation gets significantly out of control its extremely difficult to bring it back

777938 the whole chocolate bar is made of small bubbles of chocolate and it gives you a specific fine taste when you put it in your mouth it basically melts and gives you a fuzzy feeling
777939 wispa is a true icon loved by its fans we brought it back temporarily to see if the desire was genuine but fans are still rallying so we took the decision to bring it back for good
777940 we are looking at this as part of the overall picture
777941 the panel shares the unions concerns about tbgs unfortunate track record according to union and academic sources
777942 tbg is alleged by the union to have an unfortunate track record
777943 it is an exceptional step the cac has taken and it sets the record straight about us our advice and the work with our clients complies with the spirit and intent of all current uk legislation and codes of practice
777944 were proud of our track record with clients and there is nothing unfortunate about it
777945 metrovacesa is currently assessing these targets in light of the significant changes seen on both the spanish property market and the financial markets in general in the last few months
777946 there are a couple of shareholders with positions in both companies and so it is inevitable that the subject comes up when centrica meets with them as part of its normal round of talks
777947 these discussions will take place however i cannot see anything concrete happening for the rest of the summer we will have to see whether edf comes back with a higher offer
777948 centrica proposed an all share merger with british energy at the beginning of the year
777949 however there was no cash involved with the deal what the company was offering was returns in the future rather than returns now unfortunately some of the shareholders at the time were holding out for a cash deal
777950 here was this absolutely brilliant person who had forgotten more about risk and credit than ive ever learned
777951 he had been there and had the scars to prove it his major thesis was that economies and industries are by nature cyclical the ability to be able to have a successful business is about building on fundamentals
777952 i was in chile when gdp dropped 13pc in a year due to copper prices argentina during various crises the uk in 1990s when the property market fell apart and in the us when leveraged loans went bust the lbo phenomenon
777953 if youve been around the circuit for any length of time you grow to appreciate that economies are cyclical and there is such a thing as flavour of the month what you have to do is base your business on very solid fundamentals building solid customer franchises people forget its too easy to get carried away in an expansionary market
777954 people get carried away during the expansionary times and it almost appears foolish not to join the bandwagon
777955 with hindsight you can say it was a lucky accident but i think holding the dividend was a very deliberately set strategy and very coherent with our fundamental beliefs lloyds has been around for 243 years and you have to think that we are stewards are we leaving it in better shape than when we found it no i dont believe it was an accident
777956 dont hold your breath i dont buy a pair of shoes just because they are cheap
777957 you wouldnt want to have regulators squeeze everyone into a one size fits all box
777958 there has to be some sense that people who took a prudent approach were the ants rather than the grasshoppers probably shouldnt be penalised or shouldnt have a free ride given to those who managed their affairs less prudently
777959 having bonuses that were very short term that didnt look at the consequence and didnt fully measure the risk probably didnt make an awful lot of sense and probably should be changed but are you going to mandate the change or are you going to let the market do it my first instinct would be to let markets correct the problem
777960 there should be some kind of intervention in the markets as they take time to resolve themselves and i have no doubt they will do but how much damage will intervention do in the meantime
777961 in the last decade weve lived in a wonderfully benign environment and if you took a lot of risk you were rewarded but is the cycle always going to remain benign
777962 take a look at my sexy free videos i love getting myself off on camera and now im pregnant im hornier than ever
777963 im a webcam model so when im horny i log on line and masturbate for others i love to be watched the thought of lots of eyes on me guys i dont know gets me wetter than if i was just getting off by myself

777991 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
777992 if real fraudsters had been in charge of the fictitious companies they would have been clear to bill medicare from the virginia office for potentially millions of dollars worth of nonexistent supplies
777993 will only be successful if those tasked with ensuring compliance exercise due diligence when conducting screenings and inspections
777994 because office buildings have air conditioners and in the wintertime it would be safer because maybe employees wouldnt have to travel in bad weather on certain days
777995 im not certain at this moment whether this would be our biggest reduction i would be pretty surprised if thats where we would get our energy efficiency savings

778035 this afternoon i finally caught up up on steve vinoskis recent
778036 rest is now beyond the peak of the hype curve and is sliding down waay down
778037 hype could be a problem for rest if the industry gets on board with it as a commmercial factor that requires ticking off rather than some dorky engineering stuff do they have rest
778038 the rest architectural style defines a number of basic rules constraints and if you adhere to these rules your applications will exhibit a number of desirable characteristics such as simplicity scalability performance evolvability visibility portability and reliability non restful pox applications violate these basic rules first they dont define a uri for every resource and second they dont constrain the interactions to the methods defined in the uniform interface instead they define a single url that represents an operation that can be performed on any number of unnamed resources essentially they are tunneling rpc calls through the url
778039 weirdly enough building your own protocol using web services is a lot easier than understanding and using http correctly rest and restful http are
778040 the world is inherently heterogeneous even in languages and language runtimes there are 3 core platforms in existence today c jvm and net clr every language runs on top of one of those sticking your head in the sand in only one of those will automatically limit the market you can address
778041 being a broad architectural style rest will always have different interpretations
778042 the ning platform is one giant api that runs on what we call the core a collection of hundreds of servers and dozens of server types that power the platform presenting a homogeneous view of data and services through a variety of http based rest apis the ning apis are built using rest but php applications running on ning have access to them through a thin layer of php code that simplifies their use from within php however it is possible to use the ning rest apis directly from php its just a little more cumbersome
778043 the least common change in a rest architecture is to change the set of methods why because its hard to know what to do when faced with a method you dont understand you can deal with this to some extent by returning a response to indicate that you didnt understand or only partially understood the client may be able to refashion the request to take into account the protocol mismatch however method changes require special and individual attention there are few hard and fast rules as to what strategy will work this is one of the reasons why methods in rest architecture tend to be so heavily restricted every one must pull its weight as reinventing or altering the set makes it difficult to continue moving an architecture forward the other set of common changes is a restructure in server uri spaces however this is not a protocol change the clients still work they just need to be reconfigured to point to the new urls note that this can be done in protocol via redirection response codes in short i think that soa is fine and a proven technology when it is possible to upgrade your whole architecture in one go to the new protocols i think that rest is the only proven technology when only a tiny fraction of the overall architecture can be upgraded in a single sitting you cant upgrade the whole web rest accommodates this note that if you dont have a definitive list of all content types and all methods in use across your architecture you arent doing rest yet rest uses standard methods and standard media types it is still up to your architecture to define the sets but they must be defined and controlled not only that but they need to be defined and controlled separately so that the set of methods and the set of media types can evolve independently
778044 we need some more books that are written for programmers who need to get something done on the web and want to do so with as much principle as makes sense for them along the lines of effective java poeaa or ajax patterns

778049 i know these two american shetland ponies will be good ambassadors of the breed here in hong kong and i am confident that they will bring many young riders a great deal of joy for years to come
778050 we were honoured to be a part of this entire process
778051 the two shetland ponies have carved a small place in olympic history i am grateful to the hkef the hkjc the united states equestrian federation the american shetland pony club pinto horse association and the many businesses in the us and hong kong who joined forces to make this event a reality

778053 the specs answer to determining whether youve seen an item in another feed is that atom ids should be globally unique so equal atom ids are proof that two entries are the same however many aggregators dont trust the web to use ids correctly and end up generating their own
778054 and because ids should be eternally static and globally unique so they would yknow identify entries
778055 if aggregators dont trust publishers to mint ids correctly what makes you think they will trust publishers to correctly assign any other property of the entry intended for the same purpose
778056 the point is that theres no place to carry them forward
778057 i think this would be more interesting if we looked at the use case

778065 on the way mccain reminisced about his evening in new york
778066 as has been their hallmark this congress bush mccain republicans have once again run away from an important debate failing to back up their words with action
778067 it is this kind of misplaced priorities that is making america less secure
778068 republicans rejection of this vital bill is indefensible it shows a lack of support for our troops and underscores how desperately america needs more senators committed to change
778069 i have pledged to conduct a respectful campaign and i have urged time after time various entities within the republican party to also do that
778070 on july 3 news reports said senator john mccain worried that he might lose the election before it truly started opened his doors to disciples of karl rove from the 2004 campaign and the bush white house less than a month later the results are on full display the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook mr mccain used to pride himself on being above this ugly brand of politics which killed his own 2000 presidential bid but he clearly tossed his inhibitions aside earlier this month when he put day to day management of his campaign in the hands of one acolyte of mr rove and gave top positions to two others the r sum s of the new teams members included stints in mr bushs white house and in his 2004 re election campaign one of the most negative and divisive in memory
778071 the old happy warrior side of mr mccain has been eclipsed a bit lately by a much more aggressive and more negative mr mccain who hammers mr obama repeatedly on policy differences experience and trustworthiness
778072 mr mccain is clearly trying to sow doubts about his younger opponent and bring him down a peg or two but some republicans worry that by going negative so early and initiating so many of the attacks himself rather than leaving them to others mr mccain risks coming across as angry or partisan in a way that could turn off some independents who have been attracted by his calls for respectful campaigning
778073 on july 3 news reports said senator john mccain worried that he might lose the election before it truly started opened his doors to disciples of karl rove from the 2004 campaign and the bush white house less than a month later the results are on full display the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
778074 listen nobody denies hes one of the smartest political minds in america id be glad to get his advice i get advice from a lot of people id be happy to have his advice he beat me i certainly would be glad to get his advice i dont think id want to revisit how he did it and i mean that i mean that i dont feel like reliving my defeat
778075 like so many other promises cast aside in his pursuit of the white house john mccains promise to run a respectful campaign didnt even make to his convention
778076 we all respect john mccains service to our country but he has clearly become an honorable man running a deeply dishonorable campaign the american people deserve better and john mccain knows it
778077 we need to have change in america we need to do things differently i want to prove to you that i will wage a respectful campaign mccain town hall thomasville al 4 21 08
778078 yeah i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into youre less patriotic than me im more patriotic

778098 while john mccain is focused like a laser beam on pressing issues like britney spears and paris hilton the american people still dont know where john mccain stands on the issue of raising payroll taxes
778099 while hes previously said one thing on the campaign trail he now is saying something entirely different the american people deserve a clear answer from senator mccain he may be tying himself in knots to keep the base of his party on board but the bottom line is clear a vote for john mccain is a vote for more of the same politics and failed bush policies
778100 last september he was forced to defend his refusal to sign a no new tax pledge offered by the conservative americans for tax reform
778101 meeting with us last december before the primaries he declared that
778102 no look here we are americans are hurting you know that i know that these are tough economic times do we want to raise their taxes and have the government take more of their money we cant raise peoples taxes particularly at this particular time
778103 mccain no i have said and will say i will say that everything has to be on the table if were going to reach a bipartisan agreement

778131 senator obamas action today will help unify the democratic party it also underscores the need for a fairer and more sensible process for selecting presidential nominees as well as the critical role of michigan and florida two representative swing states over the efforts of iowa and new hampshire to perpetuate their privileged position in that process

778163 it is time that we review agency practices and existing law to ensure that the privacy rights of individuals are not violated through the development of new technology

778166 program which aimed to positively identify people from a distance through technologies such as face recognition or gait recognition
778167 leave behind prototypes with a limited number of proof of concept demonstrations in extremely high risk high payoff areas
778168 risks spending funds to develop systems that may be neither deployable nor used to their fullest potential without costly revisions and retrofits
778169 may be obligated or expended on research and development on the terrorism information awareness program
778170 current data mining operations practices and policies at the department of justice
778171 if we need a big brother john poindexter is the last guy on the list that i would choose
778172 the primary goal of tia is the assured transition of a system level prototype that integrates technology and components developed in other darpa programs including genoa genoa ii tides genisys eeld wae hid and bio surveillance
778173 does not authorize fund or move into the department anything like it total information awareness
778174 intended solely to authorize the use of advanced techniques to sift through existing intelligence data not to open a new method of intruding lawful everyday transactions of american citizens

778179 nothing in this legislation should be construed as requiring or encouraging hsarpa homeland security advanced research projects agency to adopt or replicate any specific programs within darpa such as the total information awareness program or as conferring hsarpa with any additional authority to overcome privacy laws when developing technologies for information collection
778180 i have a serious concern about whether this type of program called total information awareness can be used responsibly i intend to advocate that congress and the senate armed services committee vigorously oversee this program to ensure there is no abuse of law abiding individuals privacy
778181 congress should shut down the program pending a thorough investigation
778182 the defense secretary should appoint an outside committee to oversee it before it proceeds

778225 it s downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
778226 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
778227 in yet another dishonest attack at the urban league senator mccain misled the american people about senator obamas record and his own
778228 with that kind of track record senator mccain should be the last person lecturing senator obama about a commitment to quality education for our nations children
778229 i don t think the campaign is negative in the slightest
778230 i think john mccain has harmed himself in the last week really eroding any capital he had built up in terms of what kin of politician he is
778231 but hes really helped our campaign because so many of you have contributed in the last week our field offices had people pouring into them yesterday
778232 isnt to compare barack obama to one person who is best known for being a porn star and another who was recently hospitalized for mental illness attempting to smear a public figure

778238 when martin luther king jr was arrested in georgia for leading civil rights protests kennedy against the advice of several key campaign strategists called mrs king on october 26 to offer help in securing her husbands safe release kennedy was subsequently endorsed by the rev martin luther king sr father of the civil rights leader the black vote went heavily for kennedy across the nation providing the winning margin in several major states
778239 with pres george w bush and sen john f kerry both after the african american vote a recently unearthed recording reveals how martin luther king jr regarded blacks influence in an earlier presidential contest according to a transcript by the martin luther king jr papers project at stanford calif university king maintained that black voters were key to propelling sen john f kennedy to the white house in 1960
778240 on election day kennedy won the black vote in most areas by wide margins and this may have provided his margin of victory in states such as new jersey south carolina illinois and missouri
778241 many black people were not allowed to vote in the 1960 s because the white people in the south used any excuse to not allow them to register to vote they required people to pass a test and pay money to vote a poll tax you have to register to be able to vote without voting blacks had no power kennedy tried to get more blacks registered to vote by supporting students to go and register black voters in the south he thought that if blacks could vote they could change laws and the people who governed them more government people would then help the blacks because they would want the black people to vote for them
778242 it turns out that this is a problem all over the web since friday afternoon and is sitemeters fault
778243 the blacks gained the right to vote in usa in 1966 this led to the emergence of the black power movement which lasted till 1975 due to the racism and inequality the black power rose against all odds to fight for their freedom and rights this mission proved too dangerous and thousands of people sang to their tunes at the lincoln memorial martin luther king delivered his famous speech i have a dream which broke all barriers and the black society rose ahead for their basic rights to freedom the march happened to be a huge success with almost 200 000 supporters after that king had a meeting with president j f kennedy and their demands were granted blacks winning the right to vote had a great impact on the society and thus changed the political landscape
778244 the real answer is in 1870 dumb a black actually gained the right to vote in 1870 with the passing of the 15th amendment oh and dr king fought for desegregation and equal rights under the law read a book
778245 after the civil war the constitution was changed to make sure black men had the right to vote for twelve years after the civil war soldiers of the union army helped make sure that blacks would get to vote in the south when the soldiers left though whites in the south invented many ways to keep blacks from voting they succeeded for almost one hundred years learn how civil rights leaders in the 1960s helped make sure that all black people would be allowed to vote by clicking on the links below
778246 but we also did dozens of interviews with alternative outlets and leading progressive bloggers we started a my space page that has some rabidly active folks down for the cause i posted diaries on dailykos we did live chats with readers of blogs like crooks and liars the progressive community really got behind the film and any success we have had and will have for the life of the film is due to these sites and the online community

778248 over half of americans 55 rate barack obama s historic speech in berlin yesterday good or excellent and the democratic presidential candidate is experiencing a modest bounce over john mccain nationally in the latest rasmussen reports daily presidential tracking poll even nearly a third of republicans 32 give the speech good or excellent marks but democrats are far more enthusiastic with 75 feeling that way however 39 of republicans rate the speech poor versus only five percent 5 of democrats forty seven percent 47 of unaffiliated voters say the speech was good or excellent while 16 characterize it as poor
778249 unlike my diplomatic advisers i never believed in hillary clintons chances i always said that obama would be nominated
778250 the rasmussen reports daily presidential tracking poll for friday shows a bounce for barack obama
778251 i worked on capitol hill for 20 years and i can tell the difference between a staff driven politician and one who knows what he s talking about the staff driven pol mccain is an example is always capable of the big blunder he does not mix up shiites and sunnis because he misspoke he really doesn t know the difference same on the economy he studies a memo and works to assimilate it but there is no depth the sad fact is that most of our politicians are like that on the arab israeli issue all they know is that they need to sound pro israel so they end up mouthing the most superficial pieties they are afraid to talk about the palestinians because they might say the wrong thing they pander and pander knowing that they won t get into trouble by just sucking up not obama he is pro israel and he supports the two state solution he is for keeping jerusalem undivided but supports resolving jerusalem s status in negotiations he acknowledges the iranian threat to israel but does not endorse a military response to deal with it so what s obama s secret he s smart he reads he knows his sh t and that is why the republicans who are counting on him to lose this election through some verbal blunder are going to be disappointed i m not saying that mccain cannot win he can but he ll have to win it obama is not going to hand this election to him by stumbling i just talked to a friend who saw obama in israel i asked him what his friends in the israeli media are saying what are they saying they are saying that he s the next president and they think he s the smartest american politician they have seen yet me too
778252 but of course it was obama s opponent john mccain
778253 i am going to perfect you glick here take this jesus saves jesus saves
778254 in his interview with nbc s kelly o donnell which will air on nbc s nightly news tonight mccain questions whether obama should have given a speech in berlin before becoming president
778255 eighteen months ago america faced a crisis as profound as any in our history iraq was in flames torn apart by violence that was escaping our control al qaeda was succeeding in what osama bin laden called the central front in their war against us the mullahs in iran waited for america s humiliation in iraq and the resulting increase in their influence thousands of iraqis died violently every month american casualties were mounting we were on the brink of a disastrous defeat just a little more than five years after the attacks of september 11 and america faced a profound choice would we accept defeat and leave iraq and our strategic position in the middle east in ruins risking a wider war in the near future or would we summon our resolve deploy additional forces and change our failed strategy senator obama and i also faced a decision which amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief america passed that test i believe my judgment passed that test and i believe senator obama s failed
778256 from the early days of this war i feared the administration was pursuing a mistaken strategy and i said so
778257 the costs of these enterprises are not known with any degree of certainty at this time nor are the costs we will incur after what i believe what i fervently hope will be a brief successful war in iraq as we seek to establish the foundations for a peaceful stable and democratizing iraq
778258 i believe the war in iraq can be concluded successfully in a relatively brief time
778259 there s no doubt in my mind that we will be welcomed as liberators
778260 there s no doubt in my mind that once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
778261 i believe that this conflict is still going to be relatively short i believe we ve achieved significant goals and successes
778262 at what point will america be able to say the war was won
778263 we ve still got the oil fields in the north that have to be secured tikrit saddam hussein s hometown i would imagine there ll be some die hards there that but i think that we it it s clear that the end is very much in sight and today i think americans should be very proud of their leadership their technology there are still some foreigners syrians and others hanging around but it won t be long it will be a fairly short period of time but this happens in wars i m confident that once they are confident the area is no longer a threat to the marines and to or army troops that they ll start imposing discipline in the meantime we ll have a short period of chaos
778264 is it your judgment that we are near the end of this conflict
778265 i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change is accomplished
778266 operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom demonstrated to the world what we saw just 12 years ago we went to war as the most combat ready force in the world the value of that readiness is clear we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens our technology edge in afghanistan and iraq would have been meaningless if we did not have men and women trained to use it having the best weapons system platforms in the world would not have given us our victory if we had not had the right command and control facilities maintenance capabilities and munitions
778267 whatever our commitments to veterans cost we will keep them as you have kept every commitment to us
778268 insist that conference report include funding to strengthen america s military as contained in senate passed amendment instead of any extension of tax cuts for capital gains and dividends which do not expire until 2009 as contained in house passed bill
778269 obamas words ring of sincerity but thats not the key thing they grow from a much wider basis than one politicians desire to be elected
778270 it may be true that he resorts to cliches when speaking of a new world and dignity for every person but the impulse behind them is shared by millions not just in this country but around the world
778271 i dont think pretty words and promises will be enough to bring about the changes so much desired by millions
778272 his very presence the color of his skin the very strangeness of his name is the best guarantee of his betrayal of the expectations of the constituencies that will vote to elect him
778273 obamas words ring of sincerity but thats not the key thing they grow from a much wider basis than one politicians desire to be elected
778274 lets make a deal who can undermine the constitution and the rule of law better than karl rove
778275 it will be an amazing read the first 4 chapters instead of matthew mark luke and john they will be irvine chris freyja and john
778276 obama is the right man for his party and mccain is the wrong one obama is not only personally inspiring but he also seems to have a deep understanding of the value of markets and transparency he aims to fix outcomes not tinker with the process mccain on the other hand shows little respect for spontaneous free order or suspicion of expanded state power he seems to think that the main problem with the government is that the wrong people are pulling the strings
778277 he is strongly committed to helping the disadvantaged but his university of chicago background shows
778278 in other words and in short obama s slogan stand for change is not a vacuous message of uplift but a content laden token of dissent from the old style liberal orthodoxy on which clinton and edwards have been campaigning
778279 when did left leaning libertarianism become the significant and perhaps even dominant ideology among progressives a generation or two ago the dominant left wing ideology was decidedly authoritarian socialism but only right wing commentators and museum piece communists seriously think anyone really believes in socialist style central planning any more so who exactly are these libertarian lefties the best i can offer is anecdotal observations mixed with tenuous extrapolations about how they may differ from the socialist left and the libertarian right they value diversity they recognise it both as an innate right and a precondition to innovation they are committed to social justice but less inclined than their socialist forebears to achieve it by trying to make all things constrictively equal they re sceptical of highly centralised bureaucratic and inefficient structures however most of them see that up close in the corporate sector rather than as the exclusive problem of government they believe in freedom but do not see free markets and freedom as entirely the same they tend to think governments must play an active role in ensuring freedom is protected from unscrupulous employers or predatory companies reflected in the choices and opportunities we have in our personal lives or reflected in the diversity of media available they tend to regard choice and competition as generally good and cannot imagine price controls or state run industries but they know that the market often fails and they don t trust it alone to tackle issues like climate change or health care they see market power as just as likely an impediment to freedom as governments they are sceptical of over regulation believing regulation should be proportional to power and influence and not the other way around they question why the deregulation of economics has concentrated on the powerful while nanny state regulation politicised micro management and national security has made life more complex for the poor and the powerless most of all they tend to be both idealistic and pragmatic and unable to accept that we should not try to achieve more
778280 obama is a democrat and democrats want to raise taxes and mccain is a republican and republicans want to lower taxes
778281 in the post political world the candidates who can best thrive in it have tremendous appeal to the economic elites these candidates thrive in a system that does not dwell on issues and will never ask the question who has power and why
778282 the uprising an unauthorized tour of the populist revolt scaring wall street and washington hardcover
778283 hes a potential vehicle for change and i think he is a good vehicle but he is just a vehicle
778284 if the wind isnt blowing in the right direction they will perpetuate the status quo
778285 my concern is that people will think that by simply electing obama change will come whether its on race or economic justice issues
778286 if people believe that then real change will not happen
778287 for the last few weeks every reporter politician and pundit in washington have been saying obamas endorsement of warrantless wiretapping and shifting statements on nafta and iraq are moves to the center
778288 sirota is a fierce critic of what he considers to be neoliberal policies and has leveled frequent criticism at both the clinton and george w bush administrations
778289 sirota reports cleverly and in pleasing detail about a complex world of political conflict
778290 sirota hostile takeover chronicles how ordinary citizens on the right and the left are marshaling their frustrations with the government into uprisings across the country and analyzes the effectiveness and longevity of their efforts
778291 the activism and energy frothing today is disconnected and atomized the only commonality between it all is rage
778292 after so many decades of fake populism of revolts by the wealthy red state fantasies and stock picking grandmas could we finally be looking at the real thing in this compelling book rooted in history but as contemporary as this mornings newspaper david sirota gives us reason to hope
778293 david sirota is honest uncompromising passionate and a brilliant communicator he is the most important progressive voice we have in this country the uprising should be read by anyone who wants to understand exactly how the ordinary person has been sold out by the political system
778294 this book engages in the nearly lost art of reporting to tell us whats going on in the many places that the elite media cant be bothered to look it chronicles just how fed up americans have become and nominates a few heroes for them to turn to that great senator bernie sanders or the activist nun pat daly for instance it cheered me a good deal to read how many americans are finally starting to fight back against the rule of greed that has been our lot for too many years
778295 with a historian s and a journalist s storytelling gifts david sirota describes the populist tide that so many elites fear and ignore at all our peril multinational corporations that rip off local communities as if they were resource colonies a national security state that manipulates our young to bleed for that same empire and a political elite more concerned with preserving its power than empowering citizens to become self governing since leaving the beltway behind david sirota has become a must read chronicler in the populist tradition
778296 david sirota details with clarity the sharp knife of corporate greed pointed at the throat of our democracy and the populist uprising that may thwart the threat if enough americans heed his call if you love your country buy the uprising read it and act
778297 david sirota is a clear headed and principled hell raiser for economic justice
778298 im not saying were there yet but thats the danger
778299 i dont think theres disillusion i think theres an education process that takes place and thats a good thing he is a transformative politician but he is still a politician
778300 so freya you should think before speaking about racist attitudes i did appreciate all your work on behalf of the libertarians though you surely like to write posts
778301 i dont think that barack obama is the best candidate for the office but he has youth and race as his trump card and may win just due to imagery instead of substance
778302 hi indy so glad that you noticed that obama had voted for a bill that even bob barr criticized when on countdown
778303 just for the record what has barack obama ever done what bills has he sponsored what books has he written how long has he been in the senate before that what did he do anything that suggests that he should be a presidential nominee
778304 this funding will further strengthen our ability to detect and intercept illegal shipments of weapons and materials of mass destruction enhancing efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism
778305 this legislation would ensure that for the first time these incidents are fully investigated and that those found guilty are punished
778306 our troops have performed brilliantly in iraq but no amount of american soldiers can solve the political differences at the heart of somebody elses civil war
778307 with thousands of american service members suffering day in and day out from the less visible wounds of war reports that the pentagon has improperly diagnosed and discharged service members with personality disorders are deeply disturbing
778308 this provision will add additional safeguards to the department of defense s use of this discharge and mandate a comprehensive review of these policies
778309 it is imperative that we build and sustain a truly global effort under an aggressive timeline to secure consolidate and reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons usable material to keep them out of the wrong hands the comprehensive nuclear threat reduction plan required by this provision is an important step in that effort
778310 the center for media and public affairs at george mason university where researchers have tracked network news content for two decades found that abc nbc and cbs were tougher on obama than on republican john mccain during the first six weeks of the general election campaign
778311 its a cherished myth of many in establishment punditry that most americans perpetually and happily find their way to the safe center of american politics
778312 so the times presents gallup data showing a clear trend toward the left and calls it a
778313 the reality is that longterm trends in american opinion are generally leftward on issues as documented in well researched studies
778314 its a reality that troubles those beltway pundits who constantly goad barack obama toward
778315 i would ask a person who is unaware of obamas positions what he she thinks is the most important issue and give obamas plans or platform
778316 moveon has announced it will spend 150 000 to air this new pro obama tv ad on mtv and comedy central
778317 to come out of this vicious circle when ridiculed will be a test of integrity and character for such people and i know i can modify my behavior to help them see things more objectively but as i said it is more progressive to make an example out of them which would be a better lesson for the group as a whole its upto them though it may be slow and painful process or it might take some jolt of lighting wisdom somehow hitting you or you can die in denial protecting your ego and opinions to the end
778318 reforming washington reversing the enormous national debt updating the tax code offering universal health care and establishing a new image abroad
778319 have you ever heard about figures such as george soros in the news coverage of critical issues of current times george soros is the invisible hand behind much of the manipulation of our culture he is using 400 million of his dollars a year to fund groups that are dedicated to destroying our culture and its traditional values
778320 when jerry brown ran for office he listed an entire booklet of his record for examination and i have always been impressed with the need for politicians to do that so that their constituents can know what to expect from them if they continue in office i suspect that his reminding people of all that he had accomplished while serving them has made it possible for him to be elected so often to so many different positions in california so i expect the same from other candidates
778321 higher taxes not good for the dignity of the individual
778322 we are called to speak for the weak for the voiceless for victims of our nation and for those it calls enemy
778323 economists of various ideological persuasions however view mr mccains assessment as inaccurate or exaggerated contrary to mr mccains assertions the democrats proposals if enacted would actually reduce taxes for the middle class
778324 in a study of the candidates plans made public wednesday the nonpartisan tax policy center concluded that in contrast to mr
778325 senator obama offers much larger tax breaks to low and middle income taxpayers and would increase taxes on high income taxpayers
778326 in his effort to run the best campaign of 1980 john mccain has hauled out the dusty tax and spend label from the gop basement and tried to wrap it around barack obama
778327 as you are looking from the outside in to situations that have been developing over a period of time i guess you are able to look with rose colored glasses on what is currently transpiring
778328 the reality is that obama will support higher taxes not good for the dignity of the individual
778329 support more government programs which will require more taxpayers money
778330 and support a judiciary system with radical rulings encourage abortion and entitle criminals to more than their fare share of rights
778331 i wish obama was as idealistic as you seem to think he is
778332 ill be looking for a a focused tightly crafted argument and analytic rigor in working through the legal or policy problems raised by your topic 2 a thorough examination of the diversity of opinion that exists on the issue or theme 3 a willingness after having looked at the various facets of the topic to take a stand and offer concrete proposals or approaches to the problem

778344 as one of the principal shareholders of teliasonera we have followed closely the discussions between france telecom and the board of directors of teliasonera when france telecom announced their indicative proposal on june 5 we stated that the offer did not reflect the full value and potential of teliasonera france telecom today announced that they withdraw their proposal to combine with teliasonera the governments intention to reduce its ownership in teliasonera remains unchanged
778345 i note that today robert mugabe has forced the implementation of a second round of elections in defiance of both the international community and democratic decency the election now being conducted contravenes the principles of free and fair elections
778346 here the zimbabwean people are not being given the right to freely choose their president in view of this i strongly question robert mugabes continued presidency the legitimacy of a government is based on the free will and support of the people
778347 the zimbabwean regime has now deliberately driven the country and its people into a state supported culture of violence characterised by massive violations of human rights
778348 now the neighbouring countries and the southern african development community sadc must take their responsibility for re establishing democracy human rights and the principles of the rule of law

778358 the banks are down 70 on the year the others are down 40 50 we are down by 10 id take that any day of the week
778359 what we must do is manage this downturn we will get through it and we will see the housing and property market come back any intervention by the government such as reducing the stamp duty or propping up an ailing property market using taxpayers money would be a disaster and the bar room economists in the sunday independent shouldnt be allowed get away with that kind of nonsense
778360 the banks are effectively closed to lending currently taking this action i believe would reverse this trend and in turn inject confidence in the economy
778361 it would have a very positive influence and could well create the necessary momentum to turn around the current economic situation
778362 many people currently in a position to buy property or to get their first step on the property ladder are sitting on the fence because they feel house prices and commercial property might fall further
778363 the national treasury management agency is an independent body and this is an opportunity for it to show confidence in the irish banking sector
778364 this would be a reduction from 9 per cent to 4 per cent for one year and would act as a vital stimulus for the market stamp duty on uk commercial property is at a maximum of 4 per cent and many irish investors have gone overseas as it is cheaper to make such investments this would be done as a specific contained measure for a 12 month period purely to stimulate growth in the economy

778398 you cant compensate for having one area underexposed and one area overexposed

778401 so if you have a pumpkin in one shot and a few months later you wear an orange shirt later when youre searching for the day you visited the pumpkin patch it wont show photographs from when you were wearing the orange shirt
778402 the idea behind this is annotation of large collections of photos
778403 we know that if you put annotations on photos that its much easier to retrieve them but we also know that its tedious and difficult to do we use the advanced techniques that are available such as face detection and image clustering to make it easier for you to interact with your photos we also use a game graphics card for higher visual quality
778404 a picture is not just a description of what is there
778405 for instance if you have a picture of a hotel and you showed it to a friend you probably wouldnt just say and thats the hotel we stayed at you might instead launch into a story about the waiter with purple hair who served you duck soup at the hotel restaurant even though you didnt have a picture of him the photo would be a reminder of the stories that surrounded that photo

778426 your recent comment on obamas brandenburg gate appearance noted something at the end about the possibility to lose the war on terror to me this says that you believe that somehow someway that that war can be won
778427 anybody who believes that this claimed war on terror can be won is historically stupid

778491 heartbreaking the girls last terrifying moments are delivered with such vivid texture that they are almost too painful to read the technique and execution is not unlike truman capotes in cold blood and just when your heart is broken by this terrible tragedy franscell adds a coda that will further disturb your peaceful sleep
778492 ron franscells breathless fall the darkest night is a true crime tale that grabs readers on the first page and doesnt let go until long after the final word thanks to franscells daily journalism experience his polished yet conversational writing style appeals to the everyman fall barely stumbles as franscell delivers a crackling story of lives and innocence lost
778493 few authors understand what makes a true crime book stand out like a beacon from the mass of prosaically gruesome re telling of police reports ron franscell does fall the darkest night explores the true story of this unholy sacrifice of youth and misplaced trust in a gripping throat tightening way it is an almost hypnotic read hard to look away from but it is also compassionate as we question the awful fate of the victims sadly singled out by fate or luck or whatever shapes our destinies this is a very very good book a gem for readers who look for the whole story written by a very very good writer every time i hear a neighbor or a local lawman in a traditionally low crime town say something like murder doesnt happen here when of course it does i shake my head this time it happened in casper wyoming and ron franscell takes you there completely it will make you cry honest tears the victims deserve no less
778494 ron franscells fall the darkest night is the best exploration of a true crime ive read since in cold blood
778495 fall is an intimate true crime story franscell tells his story from a truly unique perspective what sets fall the darkest night apart in the genre is that he was there not as a victim or a perpetrator but as a child splashed by the unexpected evil of it all and he grew up with a gift to be able to tell the story in all its violent colors
778496 the book is as much ron franscells own story as it is becky thomsons or ron kennedys making fall the darkest night stand out from the legion of true crime books the author here was an affected bystander not a neutral observer after the fact the story in fall the darkest night is in the end too horrifying to try to explain
778497 ron franscell reveals extensive new details of one of the vilest crimes in wyoming history one that cast a long and poisonous shadow through more than three decades he returns to his hometown and mine of casper to illuminate how it touched the lives of so many who were dragged along in its wake this is first rate reporting and a riveting read

778514 we were shut down two weeks ago now theres nothing to do but sleep
778515 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
778516 as a child i grew up in a very religious family on the principle of hatred of israelis the first time i encountered them was at about the age of 10 when soldiers entered our home and arrested my father until then i had never been separated from him we didnt know anything about the circumstances of his arrest his membership in hamas was a secret matter and we certainly didnt think he was one of its founders i didnt understand anything about politics or religion i only knew that the israeli army had arrested my father repeatedly and for me he was everything a good loving man who would do anything for me he took care of us bought us gifts gave of himself whereas the soldiers entered our house and took him away from me in high school i studied sharia islamic law in 1996 when i was only 18 i was arrested by the israel defense forces because i was the head of the islamic society in my high school its a kind of youth movement of the organization and my process of awakening began
778517 until then i knew hamas through my father who lived a very modest and loving life
778518 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do for example i remember how the family of saleh talahmeh a member of the military arm of hamas who was assassinated by israel was forced to beg for financial assistance because they were left with nothing after his death the hamas leadership abandoned them as well as the families of other shaheeds martyrs while the senior members of the organization abroad wasted tens of thousand of dollars a month only on security for themselves
778519 even some of the current leaders of hamas were involved in the past in the security arm in the prisons so that he is among those responsible for these acts they were suspicious of prisoners who spent too much time in the bathroom even if it was only an upset stomach they suspected that the prisoner was transferring information or alternatively having sexual relations with other men a homosexual the gays were immediately suspected of collaboration then i understood that not everyone in hamas is like my father hes a nice friendly man but i discovered how evil his colleagues are after my release i lost the faith i had in those who ostensibly represented islam
778520 youll see this interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it although i was never a terrorist i was a part of them surrounded by them all the time
778521 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
778522 only those christians with whom i met and spent time knew about my decision for years i helped my father the hamas leader and he didnt know that i had converted only that i had christian friends
778523 you have to understand i was never one of them although i helped my father and accompanied him i was always opposed to the use of terror hamas members didnt like me i didnt come to pray in the mosques i hung around with strangers they didnt like my leather jacket or even my jeans they considered it going astray but i helped my father and conducted his affairs because hes my father not because hes a leader in hamas im not a hamas activist who converted to christianity thats not the story i wanted to help my father understand that harming innocent people is forbidden and through him perhaps to change other peoples thinking
778524 when i was with my father i in effect pushed a moderate hamas leader into making logical decisions such as stopping the attacks and establishing two states alongside one another
778525 but within hamas there were other leaders mainly from the gaza strip and damascus who thought they had to continue with suicide attacks as an effective means of achieving their aims the problem was that they were stronger than my father in terms of their status in the organization what helped stop the attacks in the final analysis was israels attacks against the hamas leaders
778526 he had no connection to the military arm but they always consulted him about strategic decisions the hamas leadership did not make decisions only according to the opinion of the organization leaders in syria or gaza however you have to remember that the hamas leadership in damascus was in control of the organizations money therefore it had the most influence on organization policy they were also the only ones who were not restricted in contacting one another as opposed to the leaderships in the west bank and gaza so that they also served as go betweens among all the groups in hamas and incidentally although they now claim that the revolution in gaza was not planned i can tell you from clear knowledge that a year earlier in the summer of 2006 they spoke among themselves to the effect that if the tension with fatah continued they intended to take control of the strip
778527 i like his voice but dont always understand the words
778528 i respect israel and admire it as a country im opposed to a policy of killing civilians or using them as a means to an end and i understand that israel has a right to defend itself the palestinians if they dont have an enemy to fight will fight each other in about 20 years from now youll remember what im telling you the conflict will be among various groups within hamas theyre already beginning to quarrel over control of the money
778529 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
778530 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist
778531 do you know that hamas was the first to use the weapon of suicide bombers against civilian targets
778532 they are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise but no suicide bomber will find himself there and no virgins are waiting for them after they have carried out an attack they have to understand that islam was created by people and not by god
778533 in my eyes there were all cruel ugly inside but i think that mahmoud zahar one of the leaders of hamas in gaza is one of the worst
778534 people with an open mind i liked to walk around among the buildings the restaurants the people to feel the night life i have many friends there whom i would like to see and i dont know whether ill be able to do that at all i mainly miss my mother my brothers and sisters but i know that it will be very difficult for me to return to ramallah soon
778535 i hope that ill succeed one day in becoming a writer in order to write about my personal story and about the middle east conflict but at the moment at least my ambitions are only to find work a place to live i have no money i have no apartment i was about to become one of those homeless people but people from the church are helping me im dependent on them
778536 i left behind a great deal of property in ramallah in order to achieve true freedom i wanted to get to quiet surroundings that would help me to open the eyes of the muslims and reveal the truth to them about their religion and about christianity to take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east i dont give islam a chance to survive for more than 25 years in the past they scared people and in that way they prevented anti religious publicity but today in the modern age they wont be able to hide the truth any longer
778537 i hope that someday god will give the opportunity to meet the right one she will have to be a believing christian and if shes a jew who converted even better
778538 there were parts of my game that werent up to scratch like losing my feet a bit my defensive pressure wasnt up to scratch

778585 la reafirmaci n de moreno con el consecuente mantenimiento de los ndices de inflaci n es una falta de respeto al pueblo porque somos nosotros lo que pagamos esta pol tica de los kirchner
778586 adem s la conferencia de prensa muestra de conjunto que no van a cambiar porque reafirmaron todas las pol ticas cuestionadas como el tren bala la esencia de ellos es gobernar para los grandes grupos en todos los rubros
778587 la presidenta se hizo un lifting pol tico con la conferencia de prensa
778588 ese no era un proyecto de izquierda era para pagar obligaciones externas y lo reconoci kirchner en la uom por suerte nunca consultamos a cristina kirchner para decidir qu hacemos porque si no hubi ramos acompa ado la privatizaci n de ypf y todo lo que hizo el menemismo

778590 hay una argentina que intenta seguir aferrada al pasado la sociedad rural dici ndoles a los presidentes qu tienen que hacer y un gobierno que pulsea medi ticamente pero no toma decisiones concretas en favor de los que menos tienen
778591 a la presidenta le falt autocr tica y sus largos discursos impidieron que todos pudieran preguntar
778592 esta conferencia fue un caso de lo que en las clases de periodismo se ejemplifica con el perro que muerde al hombre no hubo noticia
778593 le falt autocr tica a lo largo de toda la conferencia
778594 espero que las conferencias de prensa de cristina sean una rutina el presidente de la sociedad rural habl de la inflaci n es un gran problema
778595 celebro que haya retomado el di logo con la prensa pero lamento profundamente que no haya tenido autocr tica
778596 no hizo menci n ni a los cambios de funcionarios que la sociedad reclama como guillermo moreno ni a temas de tremenda actualidad como la inflaci n la grave situaci n de c rdoba o la realidad de aerol neas argentinas
778597 no fue seria la conferencia por parte de presidenta no tuvo definiciones y es grave que haya ratificado que no va a haber cambios en su gabinete y en su pol tica de gobierno
778598 me llam poderosamente la atenci n que nadie preguntara o que la presidenta omitiera hablar sobre el acto en la rural
778599 creo que la conferencia la arm la presidenta para arrebatarle la tapa de los diarios al campo
778600 no hubo novedades no hay cambios de gabinete ni en el indec ni con moreno no dijo nada sobre un tema importante como es la seguridad no se han planteado una verdadera autocr tica de lo sucedido
778601 la idea de la conferencia de prensa me parece positiva pero sobre el tren bala dijo que era un pr stamo como si los pr stamos los pagaran los chinos
778602 s me pareci correcta la respuesta respecto a cobos fue una respuesta positiva
778603 la conferencia tuvo sabor a nada lo m s grave fue que se prohibi la repregunta a los periodistas
778604 que la presidenta contin e sin reconocer la inflaci n como uno de los principales problemas de la poblaci n en especial de los sectores m s pobres
778605 le resulta imposible plantear los actos de gobierno hacia el futuro sobre la soluci n de los verdaderos problemas de la gente como inflaci n inseguridad y la energ a no emite palabra
778606 pens bamos que era n stor pero no son los dos
778607 estamos en el peor de los mundos cristina no hace m s que ratificar lo peor de su gobierno a guillermo moreno y al tren bala
778608 a la vez niega la inflaci n la crisis energ tica y los problemas fiscales tampoco se hace cargo de la inseguridad
778609 cero autocr tica despu s de todo lo que pas no aprendieron nada
778610 el haber debutado con un instrumento de la democracia como es una conferencia de prensa hubiera podido ser un buen momento para la autocr tica en lugar de eso dijo que no cometi ning n error y sostuvo a funcionarios incompetentes no entender la ineficiencia de moreno jaime y de vido es un acto de soberbia imperdonable
778611 si ya no queda decreto de necesidad y urgencia por firmar
778612 yo esperaba una autocr tica no la hubo sino una fuerte reafirmaci n de los errores que llevaron al conflicto con el campo
778613 detr s de lo dicho sobre el indec y de moreno est que no hay autocr tica sobre el manejo de la pol tica antiinflacionaria
778614 fue una buena idea la conferencia de prensa y ojal no sea un evento aislado sino que se convierta en una pr ctica normal
778615 nunca escuch un acto de arrogancia y soberbia equivalente cuando es capaz de decir que despu s de ocho meses har a de nuevo todo lo que hizo me doy cuenta de que estamos en un problema y grave
778616 basta escucharla para saber que nunca en su vida supo lo que era un ndice de precios ah me asust porque tal vez no es un problema de sinverg enzas sino de ignorancia
778617 cuando se refiere a los superpoderes dice que es una pr ctica com n y eso no es cierto ac cambiaron el 33 por ciento del ltimo presupuesto eso es una caricatura que desconoce las bases del r gimen constitucional
778618 al hablar del tren bala dijo que no nos va a costar nada porque pedimos plata prestada y qui n va a pagar esa deuda eso me pareci incre ble
778619 decir que moreno es honesto es burlarse del pa s
778620 decir que moreno es honesto y correcto es realmente burlarse del pa s que todos los d as sufre la inflaci n
778621 the coaching staff have got ideas about why it happened
778622 it is possible although you should be extremely careful doing this to initiate a legacy install within a transaction and commit or rollback the transaction yourself depending on how satisfied you are with the results this should guarantee no file or registry changes will remain if you rollback but please be careful as discussed in a previous post there are caveats here what if the installer used transactions itself your rollback would no longer roll back everything in the way you might expect they may already be committed or the installer may switch out of your transaction and proceed with the install precluding you from rolling it back

778627 the win gets us four games clear of fourth with four games left and there are a couple of blokes maybe carrying little things

778629 oh come on we gave west wing lots of love
778630 you know whats great about the foundation garments as soon as you put that on as an actor you really can step into the part
778631 for the women it is about the bras and girdles for the men its about wearing their pants really high past their belly button thats an interesting transformation for the actor because it feels so strange for the men
778632 im like this shirt is not a 14 and a half you need to bring this in i need it tight
778633 the only reason i wanted off the show at any time was sheer fatigue and burnout because we did nine years averaging 23 or 24 episodes per season 11 day episode shoots 14 hours a day so it was kind of a lifetime and a decade
778634 i never wanted to see the show go away i wanted to see the show transform into a movie franchise i wanted to play the character for longer i just didnt want to play him every day
778635 sadly it feels like the nerdiest ugliest meanest kids in the high school are trying to cancel the prom but nbc wants to try to keep that prom alive
778636 to ryan seacrest with donald trump on a radio show so that was pretty unfair but
778637 the creative community and my content providers have held a prom in my honor
778638 we have tremendous relationships and i love the creative pool that we draw on and partner with
778639 we are systematically developing and pursuing the best talent in the business and i think the best talent in the business wants to play and work at nbc and were trying to bring new voices who havent necessarily played on tv or only played on it in short time frame and have them be a permanent part of our primetime landscape
778640 and were feeling really good about the people were attracting and the level of talent that we have on network
778641 it was a freeing experience public humiliation is good for anybody
778642 does this mean apple now see themselves as a software company is microsoft facing a competitor in the platform space
778643 even if apple wanted to prevent people running os x on pcs it would likely be almost impossible sure there might be some hardware differences some odd devices maybe even a completely new bios but how hard is it really to emulate those things and run at near native speed
778644 it will only be a matter of time before someone somewhere breaks
778645 the solution is apparent apple must make its os x compatible
778646 a man must be content to receive the gift which is given him from heaven

778649 i am what i am i cant be anything other than what god has called me to be so im going to concentrate on being the best me i can be and enjoy it everyday
778650 the first although with hindsight to even talk about it this way is completely insane it felt like it was easy
778651 all they had to do was take my right kidney out
778652 nothing got me quite ready to take a shower and watching my hair fall out go down the drain and just go away
778653 trying to find ways to adapt dishes so they would taste well
778654 to give people ways to actually use the fruits and vegetables that they should eat
778655 its not a gourmet thing its about giving people the tools to actually eat better
778656 i like to do field trips to the markets to help the class get the hang of it
778657 you lose a lot of control over your life when you have cancer
778658 that is one of the great things about cooking cooking for yourself is a great way of giving yourself back some control over your life
778659 many people who have done my classes say its great to do something for yourself to make something that is good for you and you have an instant result and totally in control of it
778660 our only requirement of a recipe is it has to taste good

778666 the chautauqua county fair board meets immediately following the fair to go through what we did right and what we can improve on for the following years fair
778667 we start laying the plans on what were going to do depending on what kind of money weve made
778668 what we can put back into the grounds and back into the equipment to keep it up to snuff
778669 theres a huge physical plan there at the fairgrounds in terms of building repairs and maintenance that needs to be attended to

778677 weve renovated the barn roofs and done a lot to ensure that fair goers do not trip over cords and can be completely relaxed and safe here
778678 things most people probably wont notice but are vital to running the fair
778679 when people realize that we produce wine in new york state they ask what finger lake were on this area needs this festival the festival will help local wine producers to become recognized for being in a wine region not just a grape juice region and it will also help strengthen the new york state wine market as a whole
778680 wine production is a huge tourist attraction for chautauqua county the wine industry in new york state averages around 4 2 million tourist visits each year
778681 that number alone can tell you something about the popularity of wine and grape products in our state

778683 ive always watched him to see what he does and how he handles himself and adversity weve been all star games in the same year three times and i love to spend time with him and pick his brain

778703 we cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand
778704 will not accept pretension but will gently and very firmly confront you with your own blindness no one can see life totally as there is a blind spot in the retina of the human eye there is also in the soul a blind side where you are not able to see therefore you must depend on the one you love to see for you what you cannot see yourself
778705 what am i supposed to learn from this person or experience

778710 fantastisch om te zien dat ook zoveel jonge mensen zijn teksten helemaal kunnen meezingen
778711 belangrijkste vaststelling is wellicht dat gemoedelijkheid dit festival blijft kenmerken ondanks de schaalvergroting van de voorbije jaren

778728 when we hear about islamist resistance lets try to put ourselves where they are and try to see it from their point of view
778729 were no longer based on the existence of nation states we must reinvent ourselves
778730 for atheists considered worthy of the death penalty by islamists to team up with their ultimate opponents in attacking canadian civic society demonstrates the fundamental bankruptcy of these two political ideologies

778746 the bemus point stow ferry is a gem of chautauqua county providing both a snapshot of the areas vibrant history and a major tourist attraction for western new york
778747 these federal funds will go a long way in ensuring that this nearly two hundred year old ferry service will continue its rich tradition of crossing lake chautauqua for years to come
778748 this is great news for chautauqua county the bemus point stow ferry has been crossing lake chautauqua for nearly two centuries and this investment will support critical improvements so that the ferry remains one of new yorks historical treasures
778749 this is yet another example of our federal elected officials helping chautauqua county preserve one of our local treasures the bemus point stow ferry has been in continuous operation since 1811 and as such it has significant historical value to our region
778750 i am delighted that these grant dollars can be invested in preserving one of the few inland ferries operating in all of the eastern u s we will be upgrading the landings and bulkheads on both sides of the lake to improve the access to and operation of the ferry i cannot thank our elected officials enough for their support especially senators schumer and clinton and congressman higgins who invested considerable time in this effort
778751 and the evil i have not done that also i know is by thy grace for what might i not have done seeing that i loved evil solely because it was evil

778754 at the moment were here to concentrate on sport and absolutely maximising our performance
778755 my advice would be to if they wanted to go down any of those paths do it outside of the olympic games times
778756 the australian government and the olympic committee have put huge amount of dough into funding the sport funding us to compete and represent the country
778757 theres plenty of other avenues to pursue those sorts of activities
778758 i think theres other people in the team that could quite adequately handle that
778759 but i would leave that up to others i think
778760 thats because youre only seeing the institution a man made system thats not what i came to build what i see are people and their lives a living breathing community of all those who love me not buildings and programs not a bunch of exhausting work and long list of demands and not sitting in endless meetings staring at the back of peoples heads just sharing life
778761 we i e the trinity are in a circle of relationship not a chain of command what you are seeing here is relationship without any overlay of power hierarchy would make no sense among us actually this is your problem not ours
778762 when we three spoke ourself into human existence as the son of god we became fully human we also chose to embrace all the limitations that this entailed
778763 does freedom mean that you are allowed to do whatever you want to do or we could talk about all the limiting influences in your life that actively work against your freedom your family genetic heritage your specific dna your metabolic uniqueness the quantum stuff that is going on at the subatomic level or the intrusion of your souls sickeness that inhibits and binds you or the social influences around you or the habits that have created synaptic bonds and pathways in your brain and then there is advertising propaganda and paradigms inside the confluence of multifaceted inhibitors what is freedom really
778764 to force my will on you is exactly what love does not do genuine relationships are marked by submission even when your choices are not helpful and healthy
778765 just because i work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies doesnt mean i orchestrate the tragedies dont ever assume that my using something means i caused it or that i need it to accomplish my purposes that will only lead to false notions about me grace doesnt depend on suffering to exist but where there is suffering you will find grace in many facets and colors
778766 my love is a lot bigger than your stupidity i used your choices to work perfectly into my purposes
778767 you hem me in behind and before you have laid your hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me too lofty for me to attain
778768 revelation is meant to reveal things about the trinity and while it is of course true that we can never fully get our minds around god this is really irrelevant we are meant to get our minds around what god has revealed of the divine nature or else he would never have shared it with us to that extent we certainly are meant to understand as much of the trinity as god has revealed
778769 the word hierarchy in no way implies any sort of ontological inequality thats just silly just because i am an employee of asbury seminary doesnt in any way make me less equal or somehow inferior to the president of the seminary

778783 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
778784 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
778785 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
778786 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality

778788 we know from experience that no serious reform of the current tax code will come out of congress so now it is time to turn the decision over to the people
778789 should not be denied an education because the recklessness of others has made credit too hard to obtain
778790 in so many ways we need to make a clean break from the worst excesses of both political parties
778791 somewhere along the way too many republicans in congress became indistinguishable from the big spending democrats they used to oppose
778792 both promise big change and a trillion dollars in new taxes over the next decade would certainly fit that description
778793 all these tax increases are the fine print under the slogan of hope theyre going to raise your taxes by thousands of dollars per year and they have the audacity to hope you dont mind
778794 we call it the forked tongue express around here hell lie about anything
778795 i feel badly that with a lot of these people barry goldwater would be unwelcome
778796 i would hope for arizonas future in the republican party is that it would continue to produce leaders of the caliber of goldwater of sandra day oconnor of john mccain yet if this posture continues from the state party you wont see those leaders come from within the party anymore because no one in their right mind would deal with these people

778818 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
778819 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
778820 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
778821 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
778822 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
778823 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
778824 globally it had some help with the firmer us dollar following the non farm payrolls release

778828 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas

778835 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome
778836 of course there are some bishops who arent here and the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams spoke about how he intended to be in touch with them and consult with them and try and involve them in this process going forward

778861 the elvs have created a situation where all of a sudden momentum is sustainable for attacking teams and defending teams are forced to halt that momentum with sheer physical brutality last saturday the all black philosophy of attacking the advantage line at every opportunity paid off like a pokie jackpot gifting them a glittering gush of possession in attacking positions and releasing their backs to tear the wallabies apart in midfield at the ruck the all blacks simply smashed their way over the advantage line with the same vicious intent of the tartars sacking jerusalem

778899 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
778900 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
778901 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
778902 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
778903 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
778904 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
778905 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
778906 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
778907 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
778908 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go
778909 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
778910 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
778911 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
778912 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
778913 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
778914 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
778915 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow monday
778916 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
778917 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
778918 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
778919 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
778920 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
778921 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success

779010 while the council is spending millions of pounds on larger projects such as road maintenance schemes and eco loos we also have to ensure that we pay due attention to the smaller details such as keeping our existing street furniture and signage well maintained
779011 this is a great way to get the local community involved in brightening up and improving their neighbourhood with the school holidays in full swing some young people may be looking for something to do and what better way than to be outdoors getting physical while knowing that the work theyre doing will benefit everyone in their area
779012 we were coming down off the green running down towards the finish line and had a bit of a broach unfortunately sgt pepper was on our windward side and we went straight up into them
779013 we were doing top speed and just had a wipe out broach there was nothing they could do really and they dragged our pulpit couldnt get off and eventually the side of the boat gave way the hole is above the waterline the inshore lifeboat was on standby but as long as we kept the boat heeled over we werent taking on water

779016 that could count against us in the long run because some of the guys in the class are very experienced so when the conditions change they will know how to set up their rigs a little better and how the boats will respond so they may well be more consistent over the week but i would like to think we will be competitive from now on

779050 you newcomers always the first to judge well have to teach you a lesson
779051 your sons and daughters and whomever you have in this city take them out of this place for we are about to destroy it in service of the lord
779052 dont overreact these men mean no harm if we could instruct them in the lord theyll be just as decent as you and me
779053 get out of this place the lord is about to destroy it
779054 just like pomegranates will turn your skin red lot im sure let us sleep

779060 when in the same project there is a namespace like
779061 the pascalcasing convention used for all identifiers except parameter names capitalizes the first character of each word including acronyms over two letters in length as in the following examples
779062 do capitalize both characters of two character acronyms except the first word of a camel case identifier
779063 most compound terms are treated as single words in determing how to capitalize them do not capitalize each word in so called closed form compound words these are compound words written in a single word such as endpoint for the purpose of casing guidelines treat a closed form compound word as a single word use a current dictionary to determine if a compound word is written in closed form table 3 2 shows capitalization for some of the most commonly used compound words and common terms not bitflag bigflag bigflag endpoint endpoint filename filename filename gridline gridline gridline hashtable indices logoff logoff logout metadata metadata metadata metadata multipanel multipanel multipanel placeholder placeholder signin signin signon signout signout username whitespace whitespace whitespace writable writable writeable two other terms that are in common usage are in a category by themselves because they are common slang abbreviations the two words ok and id and they should be cased as shown are the exceptions to the guideline that no abreviations should be used in names
779064 due to the newness of managed code and the design guidelines themselves its interesting to note that the development team itself broke a core guideline by note renaming the program fxcop fortunately by the time this was noticed fxcop had become such a recognized brand that it warranted an exception according to the design guidelines
779065 short acronyms should be uppercase this rule checks namespace type member and parameter names to ensure that acronyms less than three characters long are in uppercase the rule also checks that a short acronym appearing as the first word in a parameter name is entirely in lowercase this rule and the design guidelines consider id to be an abbreviation for identity or identifier not an acronym in pascal cased identifiers instances of id should be changed to id
779066 id versus id has by far caused the greatest amount of developer annoyance and churn in source code at microsoft for at least two years no one noticed inconsistent usage of these terms because id was permitted as a two letter acronym and id was recognized by the spell checker it is a tribute to the pervasive commitment to the design guidelines at microsoft that may teams have spent many hours resolving this sole issue to bring their projects into conformance

779239 at o surgimento da internet celebridades estavam relacionadas a m rito tanto na tv quanto no r dio se trabalhava com um filtro agora cada computador passa a ser um n emissor n o preciso autoriza o para se exibir a m dia se tornou self service
779240 o fato dos nerds sairem do buraco ajudou muito a mudar a vis o sobre eles com mais visibilidade somos conhecidos e fazemos amizades importantes nos valorizamos socialmente
779241 s o pessoas interessadas em tecnologia mas que n o se ap iam somente nela ela s uma ferramenta n o podemos esquecer o lado humano de todas as rela es

779243 passado o susto inicial da tecnologia como amea a ela se torna elemento essencial vida ningu m vive sem tecnologia ela abrigou os melhores empregos e quem domina esta rea possui uma supremacia financeira esta supremacia sempre bem vinda e visada

779247 accept that some days youre the pigeon and some days youre the statue
779248 ooohh we have to be perfectly in sync look into my eyes blah blah blah
779249 dont ever tell toby i told you this but i always thought he was sort of cute
779250 it was an extremely stressful environment it showed that our health costs and absenteeism were increasing and that it was not an accident
779251 the study identified some key areas of concern and obviously we take them very seriously
779252 at cbc your colleagues are great the problem with the cbc is venal managers
779253 dont do your job in a way that makes your employees like you
779254 theyre defending our constituents who are quite capable of defending themselves
779255 i would suggest it is far more charitable to establish a level of government spending that people can depend upon year in and year out as opposed to having government spending ride a roller coaster that reflects on overly volatile revenue source
779256 the healthcare of many in my district and throughout the central valley is dependent upon medi cal providers
779257 that is why i am working to restore the cuts to medi cal however raising taxes no matter who pays more of them to increase government spending in a weak economy is not what my constituents expect
779258 you see higher levels of reliance on social welfare program in the valley because you have a disproportionate low income population
779259 really wealthy people can have second homes on the beach in california and a primary residence in reno
779260 budget cuts at these levels will devastate the coastal commission and critically impair implementation of the coastal act the commission will not be able to work with local governments on lcp local coastal plan issues
779261 needless to say beginning the layoff process and notifying 46 employees 34 percent of the staff that they are at real risk of layoff has been disruptive painful and time consuming
779262 the loss of general fund staff positions has made it increasingly difficult to address the workload to meet the mandates of the coastal act
779263 were just not sure yet we are going through every single expense we have weve made drastic cuts in operating expenses and we are continuing to do that
779264 i fully support the coastal act but the coastal commission staff is out of control at this point you cant trust them to do the smart thing with the money that they do have
779265 the staff will openly say that they dont have enough staff
779266 and they are not shy about stating that they are lacking sufficient staff to be able to make deadlines the coastal act actually includes deadlines but without penalties
779267 they routinely violate those deadlines and in the most extreme cases the applicant has to go to court and get a court order and order them to act they routinely do not meet the statutory deadlines
779268 weve been trying to show that this agency really needs to be bolstered not cut
779269 i see the coastal commission as not just the enforcing the coastal act but doing the long term planning for coastal protection there has to be some effort put into how you increase money for the commission this should be part of the planning
779270 i think the staff clearly cannot handle the current workload
779271 what needs to happen is that someone needs to step in and redesign what the commission staff is supposed to do we believe they are not supposed to get involved in residential projects that local jurisdictions already have approved
779272 i dont believe the system is designed to allow less scrutiny
779273 the time frames for processing projects have gone up and up because the staffing has gone down and down they are barely able to make their own statutory time frames
779274 there are only so many white mice and they can go only so fast the coastal act is a very labor intensive law very evidence intensive and there is an awful lot of work to do
779275 budget cuts at these levels will devastate the coastal commission and critically impair implementation of the coastal act the commission will not be able to work with local governments on lcp local coastal plan issues
779276 needless to say beginning the layoff process and notifying 46 employees 34 percent of the staff that they are at real risk of layoff has been disruptive painful and time consuming
779277 the loss of general fund staff positions has made it increasingly difficult to address the workload to meet the mandates of the coastal act
779278 were just not sure yet we are going through every single expense we have weve made drastic cuts in operating expenses and we are continuing to do that
779279 i fully support the coastal act but the coastal commission staff is out of control at this point you cant trust them to do the smart thing with the money that they do have
779280 the staff will openly say that they dont have enough staff
779281 and they are not shy about stating that they are lacking sufficient staff to be able to make deadlines the coastal act actually includes deadlines but without penalties
779282 they routinely violate those deadlines and in the most extreme cases the applicant has to go to court and get a court order and order them to act they routinely do not meet the statutory deadlines
779283 weve been trying to show that this agency really needs to be bolstered not cut
779284 i see the coastal commission as not just the enforcing the coastal act but doing the long term planning for coastal protection there has to be some effort put into how you increase money for the commission this should be part of the planning
779285 i think the staff clearly cannot handle the current workload
779286 what needs to happen is that someone needs to step in and redesign what the commission staff is supposed to do we believe they are not supposed to get involved in residential projects that local jurisdictions already have approved
779287 i dont believe the system is designed to allow less scrutiny
779288 the time frames for processing projects have gone up and up because the staffing has gone down and down they are barely able to make their own statutory time frames
779289 there are only so many white mice and they can go only so fast the coastal act is a very labor intensive law very evidence intensive and there is an awful lot of work to do
779290 i have a lot of questions number one how dare you
779291 you look like gene simmons had sex with a basset hound
779292 why cant wilson just choose when to hang out with house why does amber get to choose
779293 a really naked spirit i e a mind without a priori presuppositions cannot assume that the world is thoroughly intelligible
779294 there may be surds there may be hard facts there may be dark abysses before which intelligence must be silent for fear of going mad

779300 state agencies paying the sales and use tax have to file unnecessary paperwork when the only purpose is to move money from their agency to the general fund to another state agency
779301 for one state university we had to dedicate about 2 200 hours to an audit
779302 we could be spending that time auditing businesses to try to get more revenue for the state
779303 state government is estimated to pay 330 million to 360 million in sales tax annually were not making any interest on that money while businesses hold it
779304 i think the board needed to take action as soon as possible
779305 when the new chair comes in and essentially we have a new board in the next few months they can begin moving forward with the management team that they find reliable
779306 the basic problem with this agency is that senior management doesnt seem to understand that we are here to run this program for the benefit of the public not for the benefit of themselves
779307 absolutely not i dont care as long as they make it clear that they are not representing their opinions as those of the board
779308 termination of cea career executive assignment appointment executive director alj
779309 it is premature to take an action against the executive officer until the audit is completed and there has been an opportunity for an independent entity to gather and do the necessary evaluation of the facts involved
779310 there are clearly serious concerns about how the board has handled various issues over the past year and the impact these actions have had on staff and the services they provide
779311 the final straw for me came when i learned of the longstanding practice of delaying decisions resulting in the delay of benefits to the unemployed as a budget gimmick designed to ensure that the board would be flush with cash even though our unemployed claimants would have their benefits delayed
779312 federal standards call for 60 percent of cases to be resolved in 30 days california currently only resolves 6 percent of its cases in 30 days and we continue to have a backlog of 46 000 cases
779313 i dont know whats going to happen with that money but we need it today for registration
779314 without knowing what the circumstances surrounding that transfer it looks like its no longer available for voter registration thats a problem
779315 a number of stakeholders have been involved with this for the past year and a half and were getting anxious
779316 that was our internal date we were trying to hit
779317 there wasnt any statutory requirement the issues are pretty complex and our scientific advisory panel tool a little longer to grapple with them than we expected were not bowing to any industry pressure
779318 while were optimistic about the governors environmental record you always want to look under the hood and kick the tires before you buy the car
779319 while there was substantial agreement on many of the options developed by the subcommittees the science advisory panel did not attempt to reach consensus
779320 just trying to get a committee of strongly opinionated individuals to come up with a common document was a real challenge
779321 you could probably claim any sort of chemical is hazardous
779322 you have to look at how a chemical is used at potential pathways for exposure
779323 the fine is a record amount and sends a message that if you come to california to sell health insurance you must play by the rules
779324 we support it in concept our objective has always been to enhance fire protection services
779325 but if it becomes a budget protection fee rather than a fire protection fee we would have concerns
779326 we are pleased that the democrats agreed that there is a need for emergency response funding we will work with the legislature on the details but we need a budget to sign before this the doubling would have any effect
779327 that means we have a 310 million shortfall in the fire fighting budget
779328 will give our firefighters and other first responders the tools that they need i have gone to many of these fires and the first thing that i hear from the chiefs and the fire experts is governor we need more resources we are fighting hard but we must have help
779329 its really a double tax and now they want to charge people for doing the basic duties of the state one of which is to protect its citizens from wild land fires this should be part of a basic function of government
779330 its a silly way to do it fire fighting should be within the purview of calfire the state department of forestry and fire protection
779331 we wanted to see if there was a way we could improve consumer protection without increasing costs
779332 what seems to be going is a reversal of the epedigree work and policy that has been done over the past two or three years in the state of cal
779333 thats very problematic the administration has entered this discussion very late
779334 we cannot support a proposal that would take california a step backward with their pedigree system
779335 the governor has always been a strong advocate of using technology to improve government functioning
779336 while the governor has not taken a position on this particular legislation he looks forward to working with legislature to ensure consumer protect as well as carefully balancing the affordability of prescription drugs
779337 you spend enough time in sacramento as well as washington you realize when you establish a task force it means you have an excuse to do nothing
779338 were not really for prime time yet but i dont think we can waste any time
779339 its a federal responsibility and the federal government needs to act
779340 if you design a state by state system it will create difficulties in enforcement

779379 the great man or woman in history is someone of whom we can say on the basis of the available evidence that if they had not lived when they did or acted as they did the history of their countries and of the world to the extent that they are intertwined would have been profoundly different their presence in other words must have made a substantial difference with respect to some event or movement deemed important by those who attribute historical greatness to them
779380 we are now free of that inordinate fear of communism which once led us to embrace any dictator who joined us in our fear
779381 a hope for the long term the march of freedom and democracy which will leave totalitarian islam on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self expression of the people
779382 for the love of god get rid of them both

779386 why do people care so much its not like im hurting anyone else
779387 self cutters were three and a half times more likely to report infrequent condom use than teens who did not self cut
779388 a lot of cutters have been victims of sexual abuse or rape
779389 if you go through counseling all your problems will be fixed for sure no matter what
779390 just because you think a cutter may have trouble with their emotions does not mean they lose all common sense at the time
779391 we have a team working with bocog to unblock sites to make it easier for reporters and to remove any concerns that sites are censored
779392 apart from those sites for example which relate to pornography which is common to every country in the world to block and sites which could be considered subversive all other sites should be free to enable all reporters to properly report on the games as they have in previous games
779393 always encouraged the beijing 2008 organisers to provide the media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games including access to the internet
779394 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
779395 rogge said i want to assure you i have always kept you informed and we have not shifted anywhere on this and wouldnt have without your involvement
779396 i said im very pleased to hear that because i had big doubts this week the situation was very bad
779397 rogge said i want to give you an unequivocal assurance that i have not in any way deviated from our position that we require an uncensored internet
779398 i said if that is the case you had better put out a statement pretty quickly he said im here to tell you that theres no deal
779399 he said he was taken aback as much as anybody in the last few days that sites like the bbc deutsche welle amnesty international and so on were blocked
779400 if it makes you really uncomfortable you can wear a pantyliner in your underwear but if youre like most of us and change your underwear everyday then that isnt really necessary

779422 he ran for 950 yards in his junior season and he wasnt even the featured back on our team he wouldve had a monster senior season as the main back in our offense i really thought he couldve played at byu or utah he wouldve been a glue guy someone that wouldve found a home in the program
779423 seth was willing to do whatever it took to win games
779424 they wanted to go out there swim around and tease their friends
779425 halfway out they realized they wouldnt make it there and turned around
779426 i thought it was something that i should do alone
779427 i told sennett that if he didnt want to be there he didnt have to be he told me that if i was going to do it he wanted to be by my side it was unbelievable for a 15 year old to say that he and my son kyle were unbelievable sources of strength to me in the entire ordeal

779671 za razliku od ostalih slalomskih utrka u svjetskom kupu sljeme testira fizi ku pripremljenost sporta a jer tu zavr nicu treba odraditi u trenucima kad je jako puno snage ve izgubljeno testira naravno i tehni ku kvalitetu skija a ali tehni ka kvaliteta ionako se ne mo e manifestirati bez izuzetne fizi ke spreme
779672 nema dvojbe da je moje drugo mjesto umnogome zasluga fenomenalne publike koja me doslovno nosila stazom da ova utrka nije bila u zagrebu mislim da ne bih ostvario ovako dobar plasman ne bih se mogao tako motivirati
779673 razo aran sam no bitno je da sam do ao do cilja jer ni to nije lako na ovoj stazi nisam nikako mogao uhvatiti ritam znao sam da nemam izgleda pa sam poku ao maksimalno riskirati ali nije i lo
779674 vrlo sam sretan ovdje je uistinu udesna atmosfera ovo je jedna od najbolja utrka koju sam ikada vozio navija i su navijali ba za sve skija e moram biti sretan sa svojim rezultatom
779675 nemam velike mogu nosti za osvojiti mali kristalni globus slalom jer grange ima veliku prednost nisam danas ba najbolje vozio mnogo sam grije io i izletio sam pred sami cilj malo sam razo aran atmosfera je savr ena kao i organizacija cijele utrke

779935 i noticed a sort of exaggeration with some media after the start of this visit through describing it as a visit by a western envoy on the iranian nuclear dossier
779936 im not a mediator nor envoy i didnt carry any message from any western official our visit to iran doesnt come as part of the nuclear dossier but the nuclear dossier is part of this visit as its always part of the talks between us and any iranian official over the past years
779937 apart from my visit to france and the latest developments in this dossier its not different from the previous visits except regarding the latest developments in the issues which we discusses on lebanon palestine and others but in france we were asked through the firm friendship and relations between syria and iran to play a role in solving this issue without outlining this role
779938 we had already told the french side directly about our stance which is that any syrian role is based on the relevant international treaties and on the basis that dialogue as the only way to solve this problem its naturally in this case to ask the iranian officials in this visit about more details
779939 we as i said are discussing this issue continuously but wanted to understand the details of the iranian stance so that we can have an answer to any side in this world which might ask any question or raise visions about the issue of the iranian dossier so the issue starts with iran this means we didnt start from france we start from iran to understand the iranian point of view and then we decide if there is a possibility for playing a role or not
779940 to enhance the dialogue and making it constructive away from the political plans and pre made ideas that exist with some countries in this world and as i said this role is first based on the international agreements and subsequently any country in the world has a right as stated in the final statement to possess peaceful nuclear energy including the enrichment and to depend on dialogue as a right way its early to outline this role before we listen to other points of view from the western side
779941 firm and strong and always move forward we always make consultations over bilateral regional issues and international relations and take decisions together
779942 we have discussed different regional and international issues we also discussed in details the bilateral relations and ways of enhancing them the lebanese and the palestinian issues as well as the issues on the iraqi stage were also discussed our points of view over these issues were really positive and good
779943 continue to discuss the issues of common interest for them particularly under the current circumstances in our region which is witnessing great developments
779944 we believe that all those who stood against iran over the past years have now reached a conviction that in this issue there is no other way but to involve into dialogue and consultation
779945 were serious about the issue of dialogue and willing to complete the dialogue on real basis of the law and give way to practical results on the ground we hope that the other side is serious about the dialogue we are ready to discuss different issues on the regional and international stages our intentions are always based on peace and security
