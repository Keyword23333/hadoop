1000006 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1000007 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies
1000008 the obama assertion that he can take off the table
1000009 and somehow relieve the us of its dependence on foreign oil shows he either doesnt understand what hes saying or hes not being straight with the american people

1000012 i hated school i hated the reflection in the mirror
1000013 i wanted so much to be someone else i thought that if i was thinner the rest of my life would change
1000014 all of us were you know ridiculed whether it was by our parents or our peers
1000015 once we got to camp we realized that we had that commonality not just the weight but how we were received
1000016 youre trying to suffocate your emotions eating from stress and out of depression because you cannot stand your life
1000017 im not as attracted to you as i once was
1000018 identify one person in your everyday life who is taking positive steps to be healthy and control his or her weight
1000019 so the ass hat will regret ever uttering those words
1000020 hey its been forever but i heard youre no longer a tub whats your secret to staying motivated
1000021 itll make you too hungry do yoga if you have to but not the hot kind and dont keep any food in the house just turkey thats it and drink lots of coffee
1000022 no youre not you just think you are lets go tanning
1000023 seeing yourself naked should be enough motivation to keep your mouth shut
1000024 its just that kyle peck is coming over and youre so good at all that domestic stuff
1000025 and i dont have time to do it all myself i have to go out and buy plates
1000026 i have to put food in my cabinets or hell think im a freak
1000027 are you fucking kidding me why you gotta send the fat girl for the food
1000028 no its not you love food as much as i do

1000036 we are committed to supporting family life and stability and commitment in relationships precisely because the secure start in life a stable family background provides is the best guarantee of maximising opportunity
1000037 helping adults commit and stay committed not only opens the door to a depth of emotional enrichment which a series of shallow and hedonistic encounters can never generate it also provides the best possible start in life for children
1000038 helping families under pressure especially those under economic pressure to commit and stay committed is one of the most effective anti poverty pro opportunity pro equality steps one could take
1000039 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1000040 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1000041 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1000042 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
1000043 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1000044 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
1000045 i think that we need to do much more to ensure that fathers play their full part in the lives of their children
1000046 cultural signals and social norms do influence behaviour and the costs of relationship breakdown of children left fatherless of men behaving badly are borne by us all
1000047 alongside a new emphasis on making sure the small minority of fathers who dont live up to their responsibilities are properly challenged there must also be greater support to help the overwhelming majority of men who are doing a brilliant job for their children
1000048 its important that we see parenting as a shared responsibility with fathers playing an equal and complementary role to mothers those societies which help fathers play their full and equal role enjoy greater family stability as a result
1000049 it is important also that we ensure fathers play the fullest possible role in those circumstances where relationships do break up

1000137 it was revealed last week that john mccain has been keeping a little secret about his campaigns response to barack obamas overseas trip according to business week
1000138 elsewhere on the mccain campaign trail last week we all know how fond the senator is of insisting that he will never raise taxes never not ever
1000139 whoops conservatives were not happy its okay though because just days later mccain said i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it so that clears that up hes definitely not going to increase anyones taxes unless he does
1000140 it provides hope each morning and encourages amateur photographers each evening it sustains life on our planet and is the reason that all of us except some shitty little bacteria hanging out near thermal vents are here today not bad right the only thing keeping the sun from ranking higher on this list it hasnt really shown me very much recently no innovation its kind of a celestial stereolab cranking out the same thing over and over content in stasis some critics might say stagnation enjoyable yes but only 98th best
1000141 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1000142 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1000143 production would not be expected to start before 2017 and offshore drilling

1000156 een journalist die werkzaam is in dienst van een organisatie en diens doelstellingen actief ondersteunt
1000157 bij journalistiek denk ik niet alleen aan leuke stukjes schrijven of een mooi tijdschrift maken maar ook aan zoiets als onafhankelijkheid journalistieke redacties maken bladen naar eigen inzicht ze worden niet gestuurd door opdrachtgevers of directies die inspraak willen hebben in de inhoud van artikelen zodat ze bijdragen aan de communicatiedoelstellingen van de organisatie in de bedrijfsjournalistiek werkt het niet op die manier
1000158 onafhankelijkheid en journalistieke vrijheid worden niet gewaardeerd het is immers de bedoeling om de doelen van de organisatie te dienen niet om kritische verhalen te schrijven

1000244 i received this letter from wachovia my companys 401k provider
1000245 it was supposed to convince me to sign up with advicetrack and give them another half percent of my retirement funds so that they could manage my investments for me
1000246 tommy used to be the vp of it here at my company
1000247 he was a self taught genius who could code the hell out of some c or so im told he was exited a few months before i started here but i keep finding things like this popping up
1000248 this program was installed with it i guess the marketing department at hp must have thought long and hard before picking that catchy name
1000249 so should i end each line like it is on the paper is this word wrapped or is each line terminated by a carriage return
1000250 is there a way to start the exam over i think theres a problem with it
1000251 no you only get to take it once youll have to sign up for the touch typing class
1000252 well i took the typing test and i think theres a problem with it
1000253 you made too many errors youll just have to take the typing class
1000254 look id like to just compare the printouts with you
1000255 see these are the same i think that the instructions are wrong i didnt press the enter key after each line because i was instructed not to how exactly are the errors counted
1000256 the enter key is irrelevant your errors are in the sections that you didnt type
1000257 how exactly did these count against me when i never even got to type them because it stopped me when i had too many errors
1000258 you know all they have to do is change the instructions
1000259 oh yeah you are supposed to hit enter its funny almost everybody has failed the typing exam
1000260 i used stl list how can you say i didnt use a linked list
1000261 i was tasked with figuring out why one of our admin pages would get stuck in the middle of the loading screen

1000263 this set up was purely temporary after a few years of running like this uktv finally fixed things by building a brand new facility
1000264 go through a mental list of major government programs and ask how many of them you would enact today in their current formats
1000265 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1000266 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1000267 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul collingwood and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1000268 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday
1000269 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
1000270 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future

1000287 um so youre not worried about critics revealing where peggys baby is
1000288 omdat het mij aanspreekt met mensen die een handicap hebben te werken het was een gevoel wat ik had ik deed hiervoor iets heel anders en ik had zin om een volledig andere richting in te slaan voordat ik naar esdege reigersdaal ging was ik elektricien voor de nuon na mijn periode bij de nuon had ik geen zin meer om weer in dezelfde branche te werken
1000289 ik vind het geweldig om te zien hoeveel doorzettingsvermogen mensen hebben die een handicap hebben als voorbeeld met mensen met hersenletsel mensen met hersenletsel zijn allemaal verschillend in tegenstelling met mensen die geestelijk gehandicapt zijn
1000290 we doen bij aankomst eerst een kopje koffie daarna voeren we werkoverleg en bereid ik de activiteit van de cli nt voor na de activiteit te hebben voorbereid voeren de cli nt en ik deze activiteit uit
1000291 ik heb de opleiding sociaal pedagogisch werker met succes gevolgd dit was overigens een deeltijd opleiding sociaal pedagogisch werker spw is een mbo opleiding op niveau vier de opleiding spw volgde ik op de hogeschool in holland in alkmaar
1000292 ja in de advertentie in de krant werd die opleiding gevraagd ik zag de advertentie en had meteen daarna gesolliciteerd met een lagere opleiding kon ik niet aan de functie beginnen
1000293 we werken volgens de visie die esdege reigersdaal heeft we willen de cli nten op de best mogelijke manier begeleiden met de activiteiten die we voor hun opstellen soms kan een activiteit sporten zijn een andere keer is het een spelletje de cli nten zijn geestelijk in orde dit neemt een stuk verantwoordelijkheid weg ten opzichte van een persoon die geestelijk gehandicapt is
1000294 wij vinden dat de ondersteuning die wij bieden moet bijdragen aan een zo goed mogelijk bestaan van de cli nt zodat hij op een volwaardige wijze deel uitmaakt van de samenleving op een manier zoals hij dat zelf wilt de houding die daarbij past is er een van respect voor de cli nt en diegenen die voor hem belangrijk zijn respect voor eigen mening wensen en keuzes
1000295 ik zou zo snel niet mogelijke verbeteringen kunnen bedenken misschien de evaluatie van de ondersteuningsplannen
1000296 ik vind de kwaliteit heel goed momenteel er wordt goed gekeken naar de hulpvraag van cli nten naar mijn mening wordt hier ook goed naar gehandeld door de cli ntbegeleiders de cli nten zelf zijn ook zeer over de kwaliteit van de zorg te spreken
1000297 nee geld is niet het probleem dat is er genoeg het gaat erom hoe dat geld besteed wordt er wordt veel geld over de balk gesmeten als voorbeeld neem ik dat er wordt besloten cli nten met de taxi op te halen terwijl ze dichtbij wonen deze cli nten hebben thuis ook een booster dit is een scootmobiel voor gehandicapten de taxi is naar mijn mening dus overbodig en een verspilling van geld
1000298 nee ik heb nog geen slechte ervaringen met cli nten sommige dingen zoals geheugenverlies accepteer je als cli ntbegeleider dit brengt een handicap met zich mee als je hier niet tegen kan dan moet je een ander vak zoeken
1000299 nee cli nten beslissen zelf welke dagdelen ze komen en welke activiteiten ze willen doen dit gebeurt in overleg met een cli ntbegeleider als cli ntbegeleider ben je afhankelijk van welke cli nten er die dag komen
1000300 de cli nt serieus nemen en met veel respect behandelen ik heb met de ene cli nt een betere band dan met de andere cli nt maar dat houd je toch een band krijg je door normale interactie tussen mensen in mijn geval dus met gehandicapten die geestelijk in orde zijn
1000301 ik probeer de hulpvraag van de cli nt duidelijk te krijgen door met de cli nt een gesprek aan te gaan vervolgens kijk ik hoe ik de hulpvraag het beste kan aanpakken en hoe we hulpvraag van de cli nt het beste tegemoet komen de hulpvraag verschilt per cli nt we proberen de hulpvraag tegemoet te komen door bijvoorbeeld een activiteitenplan op te stellen het activiteitenplan stellen we op aan de hand van de mogelijkheden van de cli nt

1000307 i would have loved to have gone to that kind of academy

1000309 all or part of this article may be confusing or unclear no shit
1000310 so rider you read the news today it seems that the fools are cracking down on figures now
1000311 what of it isnt it better if we have less competition for masters attention
1000312 my sons who were fascinated with the figure were begging me to buy a figure of the iron man costing rm50 each at the said shop
1000313 while scrutinising the iron man figure my elder son aiman ogled flirtatiously i kid you not this is a direct translation that kid has potential i tell you at the display rack behind the payment counter that displayed a few other toys
1000314 some of the figurines were fully nude and displayed the private parts of women in fact some of the figurines were so provocative i was ashamed to look at them
1000315 i immediately pulled my kids away and prevented them from looking at the 30 or so figurines for fear that it might damage their minds
1000316 commencing re writing of dimensional space eliminating faults and unwanted elements

1000589 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
1000590 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
1000591 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1000592 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1000593 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul collingwood and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1000594 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday

1000612 wow now i see how group discernment is done we can practice this in our business meetings
1000613 i wish i had had the comfort of this book when i first became clerk of my meeting it is easy to think of clerkship as a job or a set of responsibilities but more than that it is a web of relationships to and within the community it is an endless stream of small choices and actions that are made with that community in mind

1000628 one shouldnt look at the flyhalf position in isolation we were not selecting only a flyhalf
1000629 percy will never start at flyhalf while i coach but if we need to make use of him he will be there
1000630 it was in the interest of the players themselves that we decided to release them to their unions so that they can get game time surely that is better than just holding tackle bags all week with this more open relationship with the unions we and the players will benefit
1000631 i am quite happy with this week because i made two good starts and physically i felt good so i am coming back to a level that i want step by step the crash in the first moto means that i have to be a bit disappointed with this gp overall because i rode well in the second race and the podium would have been possible still this is something good to build on
1000632 this was a really hard track sometimes it felt like enduro there was obviously an advantage for the benelux riders here and for me it was hard but then again not so bad i finished both races and had a good ride in the first moto i had to take it easy in the second moto because i am not 100 with my knee still this is one of my best results in the sand i will hear from my doctor this week so loket could be my last race as i want to have surgery and get a good winter of training done ready for 2009
1000633 i just did my best today the track was almost indescribable as to how deep rough and hard it is to ride on i have never experienced anything like that or fought so hard for a race position i wanted to put in a good finish for the team because they have been working so hard to get things right for me and i wanted to give them something back for it i did not know what to expect here but people tell me that the circuit in loket should be a bit more regular the set up is so professional at the world championship and everyone wants such a good image for the sport i think this is definitely the premier motocross racing series in the world
1000634 i had flu coming into the weekend and it was a bit frustrating knowing i was approaching the hardest race of the year not in the best shape overall it was a pretty average gp in terms of riding and fitness but in terms of the championship points it was not the end of the world to try and be champion i have to be better than this one is example is the move i tried to make on billy in the second moto i went for it but ended up taking him down it was a bit silly and because i was so tired i miscalculated so sorry to him the first moto was ok and i came through a bit at the end but in the second i felt i could only go at i wasnt surprised by how much of a hard test this track would be normally my strength is one of my positive points but this gp i could not keep at my maximum we go to loket next and i am looking forward to a hard pack start right now i just want to ride better and hopefully feel 100 going into the race
1000635 what a hard day i crashed too much and this track was unbelievable for me it was the hardest track of them all in the first moto i changed my line in the corner and de dycker came across and hit my front wheel there was no time to react i was so tired in the second that i could not save the bike when the front wheel started to go i am second in the championship but it is more or less the same and there are four gps to go a lot of riders made mistakes today and when you go down in the sand it is hard to recover
1000636 we knew this weekend would be difficult josh was pretty good in the first moto except that his speed was so so in the first moments of the race but his pace was like the leaders by the end in the second he was around seventh and doing ok but then came together with billy when he tried to overtake he had been really ill during the week so honestly i am happy with what he did today especially because he took some points away from first position in the championship david was unlucky with the first moto crash and it was always going to be a very hard and difficult way back from that we have seen him make some very good recoveries but this was a different scenario 15th was not good for the championship but it was not a complete disaster with the amount of races we still have both ramon and david exchanged mistakes in the second moto but the result insured that he is not far away at all even if the red plate is gone for the moment it was a complicated weekend for the bikes as well and we did not have any problems which was great and the mechanics and the team worked really hard
1000637 weve got three races left including the biggest one of our season in indy before the countdown to 1 starts
1000638 what we need to do now is make sure were on a hot streak when that six race sprint to the finish starts in charlotte on sept 11 thats our second season if you will and these last few races before it begins are crucial
1000639 i hear stats like that and the first thought i have is that weve only won twice since last year we need to get that number up and what better place to do that than brainerd
1000640 ive always enjoyed the atmosphere of this race its just fun and laid back and you can pick up on that vibe and really enjoy yourself at this event the people of minnesota are a breed apart and we certainly like to hang out with them when were up here
1000641 id like to think our team is already revving up for the playoffs
1000642 i know joe hornick and stevie johns and their crew back at the engine shop have some bullets theyre working on for the stretch run everyone on the team really is collecting that second breath for the fight ahead we turned it on at the right time last year all we need to do is repeat that feat and well be fine
1000643 today i started well and i had a good speed so i am riding with a lot of confidence i pushed quite hard in the first race but after the start of the second race i decided to pull back a bit to conserve my energy and i think this allowed me to go on an win and take the overall victory
1000644 some people were surprised that a spanish rider could win on sand but i think the track conditions are not as important as my physical condition this year i have been focussed on the bike and the settings and working with my team and this has worked out very well for me
1000645 it was my goal to finish in the top five at the end of the season and that now seems possible
1000646 my team has done a very good job with the bike and for sure its one of the hottest in the paddock
1000647 there are good jumps and the corners are much better this is a track that suits me
1000648 the fight for the mx1 title is not over yet and we still have one big sand race coming up
1000649 today we had very difficult conditions for the race but i managed to choose the right tyres all the team worked really well and my thirteenth place is a big success for me the bike and the entire team
1000650 i had a fantastic start and i was able to overtake about five riders in the first curve i managed to stick with rene all the way i just had to hold back a bit at the very end because the front tyre was starting to wear
1000651 i feel like i am living a dream after taking the victory today i did make a few mistakes in the first race and i couldnt manage better than eighth but then i went out and won the second race
1000652 now i hope to carry on and to stay with ktm i really like the bike
1000653 for sure it was my best result for the season so far
1000654 in race one i took the holeshot and found some good lines but just wanted to stay focussed and not take any risks the second race was very different there were a lot of crashes and it was quite messy i wasnt going so well but i managed to close the gap
1000655 i didnt have such a good start in the first race
1000656 then i had problems at the gate in the second and then i was involved in the crash in the first corner i managed to close down the gap in the second but i crashed again and stalled the bike and made another mistake in the final lap but even if i did make some mistakes i still managed to gain a point on tyla
1000657 i managed to close the gap after the crash in race two but then i stalled the bike and couldnt finish any higher in the order and lost some valuable points now i just plan to put my head down and work very hard for the rest of the season
1000658 it was a pity that our riders crashed and couldnt finish with a better result but i am happy for ruis second place because he is a hard fighter and worker
1000659 do not be afraid stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will accomplish for you today for the egyptians whom you see today you shall see again no more forever 14 and you shall hold your peace

1000685 itll be interesting to see how idahos political blogosphere develops itll also be interesting to see when idaho republicans wake up and start taking the blogosphere seriously
1000686 risch draws a very distinct line between legitimate media and the bloggers that are left wing hatemongers the blogging done by legitimate media sources are not in the same category as the left wing hatemongers he considers the legitimate media legitimate regardless of the medium used to convey news

1000692 you cant have an exponential increase in your carbon footprint personnel and datacentre floor space
1000693 when i take cios and it managers through a server rollout in their datacentre the first thing the it manager says is im out of power and im being expected to do a lot more with a lot less
1000694 if were looking at a 10 000 server environment then you could have around 100 000 cables to deal with
1000695 so switches need to talk the language of virtual machines vms
1000696 smartconnect says you can put network switches anywhere and create logical groups that can operate over different physical ports allowing you to move vms anywhere and not just from one side of the datacentre to another
1000697 think about it if you have ethernet fc and infiniband connectivity you have three types of network administration to deal with so the obvious plan would be to simplify your i o infrastructure
1000698 air flows in the same direction as that required to cool server and storage hardware from back to front traditional switches with rearward facing ports pull in air from the front and pump it out at the back this creates hot loops and leads to inefficient cooling

1000710 what could be better than working for an organisation whose mission is to create a better place its just the best objective ever
1000711 everything ive ever done has worked up to this ive always had this ethos to try to improve life for people
1000712 when i joined london underground i was given about 18 months to transform what was a very back office and fragmented it function into something that was focused on delivering a service to the people who ran the railway and the customers who used it
1000713 the goals were to deliver real time service information to customers and minute by minute management information to the people running the railways
1000714 we used a mix of etl extract transform and load tools data marts and web technology to extract key bits of data turn it into useful information and deposit it where someone could view it
1000715 information was communicated from line control to stations by telephone it could take an hour for information about a disruption to be passed on from the controller to the last station in the chain by which time the incident would probably be over
1000716 we turned the department into a team that really understood the railway and was absolutely committed to delivering a better service and being an integral part of the business
1000717 weve got lots of databases around the place but its a case of being data rich but knowledge poor
1000718 weve got to improve this very rapidly im working with the various operations within the agency to work out their priorities in terms of information needs and working with the data management and knowledge teams to drive this forward
1000719 last summers floods highlighted the urgency of adapting to the potential effects of climate change to protect lives property the economy and the environment its clear that we are going to face less predictable weather and more extreme events such as flash flooding
1000720 providing and managing the strategic business focused aspects of it
1000721 the deal will have very clear objectives for sustainability and green it
1000722 we will make sure the provider we appoint is absolutely committed to rolling this type of contract out both down through its supply chain and into its other outsourcing contracts
1000723 if we can get the contract right and cascade it throughout the government sector it would be a real coup and if we can get our outsourcing partner to put in standard green terms that it will then use in its private sector contracts then the benefit from that would be absolutely huge
1000724 we are working with the green it working group to develop top tips for reducing carbon emissions and balance score cards so people can measure their progress
1000725 we are also doing similar things with the bcs carbon trust and intellect
1000726 sustainability and environmental impacts are factored into every business contract that we write
1000727 also we measure our mileage and ensure staff optimise their work patterns on top of that we use virtualisation and power management software to try to reduce the impact of our systems

1000740 men virkeligheden i danmark er at en del politibetjente benbart har deres forbilleder i brasilien rusland og iran

1000746 to ensure we continue the a1gp tradition of strong racing coupled with lots of overtaking the effort of the design team has been to provide a chassis that has a good level of down force but without the normal penalties
1000747 this will make for much closer racing particularly in the corners as cars will be able to run together we have spent in excess of 300 hours in the wind tunnel and have tried hundreds of different aerodynamic variations to ensure the close exciting racing the series is famous for not only continues but gets better

1000828 we honestly havent set a date for the wedding because the next 12 months cricket wise is ridiculous
1000829 i know people think its mad ive planned my wedding when im single but ive not been able to help myself
1000830 im passionate about weddings i daydream about my own and its developed into a full blown plan
1000831 of course i need a groom before i get married but ill meet mr right one day in the meantime why not start preparing
1000832 i think about it when im walking to and from work and when im at the gym i talk about it with my future bridesmaids if a magazine has covered a celebrity wedding ill make a beeline for it and pore over the photos

1000846 theres a point when consumers say enough is enough and i think theyre saying that now
1000847 our strategies for dealing with teenage pregnancy need to be focused more on young men and their responsibilities
1000848 thats why i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1000849 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1000850 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1000851 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
1000852 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1000853 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
1000854 i think that we need to do much more to ensure that fathers play their full part in the lives of their children
1000855 cultural signals and social norms do influence behaviour and the costs of relationship breakdown of children left fatherless of men behaving badly are borne by us all
1000856 alongside a new emphasis on making sure the small minority of fathers who dont live up to their responsibilities are properly challenged there must also be greater support to help the overwhelming majority of men who are doing a brilliant job for their children
1000857 its important that we see parenting as a shared responsibility with fathers playing an equal and complementary role to mothers those societies which help fathers play their full and equal role enjoy greater family stability as a result it is important also that we ensure fathers play the fullest possible role in those circumstances where relationships do break up
1000858 this is a significant trip if they enjoy the month they might start living together
1000859 and although heather does not want bea spending any time around nancy she has been told by paul she has no say in it which did not go down well at all
1000860 our analysis of these aspects of workplace behaviour reveals that women and men co mingle etiquette and emotion maintenance to be accepted in the workplace and to fit white expectations
1000861 this emotional overtime in the workplace strengthens race ethnic group solidarity
1000862 a crucial part of black womens self presentation in work and social public spaces
1000863 like all businesses we occasionally run targeted marketing initiatives to promote small pockets of availability this is in no way a reflection of the current economic conditions
1000864 in fact as noted in our most recent results released in may 2008 we have not seen any evidence of deteriorating customer sentiment in booking patterns
1000865 while this is a genuine offer which some of our customers will benefit from it is a one off promotion to promote a few selected hotels and is in no way indicative of current trading for the group or overall market
1000866 these prices are very good for people willing to travel outside the peak holiday months
1000867 turkey has been a popular market this year because it is outside the eurozone and british travellers are now familiar with it bookings to turkey are up by 20 per cent on last year
1000868 despite the economic downturn it seems many people are not prepared to give up their holiday but are more inclined to cut back on other things
1000869 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
1000870 iran does not recognize the deadline for the nuclear issue we answer to the incentives package whenever it fits us
1000871 backing down one step in the face of the arrogance of the west will encourage it to come one step forward
1000872 the idea that retreating and giving up right stances and words will make the u s change its policy is totally wrong and baseless
1000873 we will see what iran does in two weeks but i think the diplomatic process now has a new kind of energy to it
1000874 if they do not decide to suspend then we will be in a situation where we have to return to the security council
1000875 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
1000876 i didnt count the days the deadline s coming up soon
1000877 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
1000878 we have to make sure we are prepared for every option we dont want war we want peace but we will not let the second holocaust take place
1000879 is there a difference of emphasis it certainly looks as though there is
1000880 the military option although always available it not our preferred route
1000881 we have made that point clear to israel and the world in our public statements and private meetings
1000882 a policy that consists of keeping all options on the table must be maintained
1000883 within just a few months israel will be stronger and more ready in the area of defense against long distance threats
1000884 gay couples cant have biological kids together so if homosexuality is genetic why hasnt it died out
1000885 at this juncture the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the sub prime market seems likely to be contained
1000886 we will follow developments in the sub prime market closely however fundamental factors including solid growth in incomes and relatively low mortgage rates should ultimately support the demand for housing and at this point the troubles in the sub prime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
1000887 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy
1000888 weve got strong financial institutions our markets are the envy of the world theyre resilient theyre innovative theyre flexible i think we move very quickly to address situations in this country and as i said our financial institutions are strong
1000889 in one way im sympathetic to the institutional reluctance to face the music id give a lot to mark my weight to model rather than to market
1000890 recently the portfolio of cheyne finance one of the more infamous structured investment vehicles or sivs was sold at 44 cents on the dollar i suspect that similar assets are not marked anywhere near that valuation on financial institutions balance sheets so the game of everythings contained continues albeit in a different form
1000891 lenders would have to curtail loans by roughly 10 to one to preserve their capital ratios this would imply a further contraction of credit by up to 12 trillion worldwide unless banks could raise fresh capital
1000892 about 25 million u s homes are at risk of negative equity which could lead to more foreclosures and a further drop in prices the problem with writing off 1 trillion from the finance industrys cumulative balance sheet is that if not matched by capital raising it necessitates a sale of assets a reduction in lending or both that in turn begins to affect economic growth
1000893 at least now the girls would be out of some pressure from those muslims with whom they forcedly lived for 34 days
1000894 a lot of the veterans go to the university and they kind of get lost
1000895 its my opinion and just like smurf tails every smurfs got one
1000896 the weekend after i took my baby smurf to the blue moon nursery i decided to bring the tiny blue creature outdoors i carefully supervised as he frolicked through the grass of my back yard lawn i had planned on watering the lawn today so during the week i had purchased a miniature plastic swimming pool for the little smurf i picked up the wriggling creature and brought him over to the pool in which id already filled with water and a tiny floating duck toy unhooking the safety pin i removed the tiny scrap of organic cotton cloth that served as his diaper whenever i let him crawl around indoors i had found a pattern online for making the special diapers which were designed to allow the smurfs tail to poke through as soon as i placed the disrobed blue infant into the water and let go it squealed with delight and began splashing water all over the diminutive pool looking at the wee baby smurf s soft little body i felt suddenly compelled to poke its blue tummy at first the baby smurf looked warily as my finger neared his abdomen but once i began gently poking at it he squeaked merrily we played this game for a few minutes and feeling comfortable with leaving him alone i commenced to water the lawn
1000897 summer had finally arrived it turned out that the affectionate caretaker at the blue moon nursery also made miniature baby smurf clothes as a hobby and sold a few of them i visited the place during the week when it was safe to bring my tiny blue companion along and purchased for him a sunbonnet and glasses to protect his delicate face from the suns rays by this time i had also named my adopted baby smurf i called him blueberry because thats just what he looked like a plump little ripe blueberry taking him home i switched out his regular smurf hat for the bonnet while he napped when he awoke he seemed pleased with the new headgear and eye wear so i took him out to the backyard and let him play in the grass all afternoon
1000898 i am happy about it because i have something that others dont have
1000899 i never had a problem with it and after i get publicity i will be famous because of it
1000900 on two occasions we felt let down when rahul dravid didnt get khel ratna award and yuvraj singh was denied arjuna award dravid was in good form we had won 16 odis on the trot and the team was on a high still he did not get the award
1000901 yuvraj too was unlucky not to get arjuna after two years of consistent performance we are happy dhoni got it
1000902 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
1000903 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
1000904 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
1000905 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theatres
1000906 ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theatres or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents
1000907 paediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing
1000908 despite the doom and gloom of fuel costs the vast majority of motorists still enjoy driving

1000917 there is no way of check ing we have no access to any information about who is in the united states legally or otherwise
1000918 revealed phony addresses and large numbers of registrants who admitted they were not u s citi zens
1000919 and told that she was not to ask that question only whether the person wished to register to vote
1000920 she then reapplied in 1997 again claiming to be a u s citizen and was again given a voter card which was again cancelled records show she was able to vote at least four times in general and primary elections
1000921 elections decided by one two or just a handful of votes
1000922 from a relatively small universe of individuals legal immigrants who seek to become citizens these numbers do not tell us how many illegal immigrants have regis tered and voted

1001005 how the voice of rock emerged in the visual arts
1001006 somehow some way despite all thats happened to him hes still sitting here with every opportunity in the world in front of him
1001007 its one of those stories so crazy that its impossible to make up
1001008 is going to be a part of my life forever
1001009 then we built a one room house and slept on cots our porch was our kitchen we drew our water from a well and there was an outhouse for us to use up the hill
1001010 she had plenty of money so its not like we had to live like that she just wanted it that way she never wanted us to get caught up in material things
1001011 he had become a little rebellious a little hard to control at times its not like he was a bad kid michelle just thought that living with his father would do him some good
1001012 she said how excited she was that i was coming home and about how glad she was that i was her big brother
1001013 she had this big smile and freckles my mom named her after bob marley you can imagine how cute she was
1001014 he was the only one with keys to certain locks
1001015 people testified that he was planning to do something like that but he still didnt go to jail
1001016 i tried to remember the happy days i spent with them
1001017 but there were so many times when i thought why didnt i change the locks on the house or why didnt i wake up and do something to stop it
1001018 he thought he shouldve been able to save his mother
1001019 we had never had much of a father son relationship
1001020 now all of a sudden i was living with him i was used to being the man of the house and now i had all these strict rules we just never saw eye to eye on things
1001021 you cant hold down a job if you cant listen to authority growing up without me or any kind of a father figure in his life put him at a disadvantage
1001022 that was right after my mom died and i had a short fuse
1001023 its not like i was going around looking for fights but if someone came up and said something to me i didnt think i just acted
1001024 the reason the department of health and welfare stepped in was because they said you can spank your kid but you cant leave a mark
1001025 but how can you spank a kid with a belt and not leave a mark
1001026 hes never been hit hes never been punched hes never been slapped ive given him three spankings in his life and we prayed after each one he had more spankings by his mom than hes had by me hes never been abused
1001027 i dont even think they were trying to be racist or mean
1001028 that was one of the best semesters he ever had in school all as and a b
1001029 he started seeing that football could really take him somewhere and he started to focus
1001030 he had a good thing going here its a shame he couldnt work things out with his father
1001031 he told me that if i wasnt going to live with him i wasnt going to live anywhere in the state of idaho
1001032 hes a good kid but hes had a rough patch
1001033 i made every possible attempt to set him up for success now its up to him we love him were still rooting for him we pray for him every day
1001034 the bottom line is that hugh has an image in his head that hell never get rid of the image of finding his mother
1001035 hes still got a lot of unresolved anger from her death hopefully thats something he can fix
1001036 when he walked through our door a few months ago i thought oh my
1001037 you can take one look at his body and tell that hell be playing on saturdays and maybe sundays too the thing our players will come to realize is that having hugh here will create opportunities for other people
1001038 no one is going to overlook him now there are a lot of big kids out there but the things that set hugh apart are his strength and the way he moves he runs around out there like hes 220 pounds
1001039 he walked up to me stuck out his hand and said i hear youre one of the captains
1001040 you can see that he doesnt have a big ego there may be some people who are still warming up to him but i dont think theres anyone who doesnt respect him
1001041 she was a free spirit who opened her heart up to the whole world
1001042 but the person who did this to them i forgive him ill always be mad at him but i forgive him it hurts me to say that it really does but i dont want to go through life with bitterness anymore i dont want to be an angry person thats not how my mom wouldve wanted me to live
1001043 if youre stuck on the past how can you move forward

1001174 my 15 year old daughter emma has had severe epilepsy for eight years some people have the condition mildly and others can be extraordinarily ill she is at the extreme end of the scale and often needs hospital treatment and is very brave
1001175 although she spent much of last autumn in ipswich hospital she is studying for gcses at farlingaye and trying to lead as normal a life as possible
1001176 she is keen on sport she ran the woodbridge 10k road race in may without support and understanding many aspects of her life would not be possible and epilepsy action helps make this kind of support and understanding available to everyone in her situation

1001190 these labels are being funded by people whove made a fortune in another industry who have some kind of romantic notion about being in the music business its as if theyre in show business then they wake up three years later and say wow i could lose everything here very easily i think thats happening a lot around nashville right now
1001191 lets just say exactly what it is those are independent promotion companies that started calling themselves labels to get around radio corporate rules against dealing with independent promotion companies in light of the spitzer investigation
1001192 the split of the sony bmg merger is virtually a done deal well placed sources say a bertelsmann supervisory board meeting has been convened july 11 to examine the sale of the german media giants 50 stake with a final decision on a deal expected to be revealed by the end of the month following a meeting of the sony corp board

1001251 from here on out there will be action taken to make you understand
1001252 do you have some ice cream here that doesnt taste too sweet
1001253 and one would think that these customer service people in a touristy place like lugano would at least understand or speak in english
1001254 but this guy seems to be the non touristy type i guess he just happens to work at the ice cream shop in the neighborhood
1001255 each time batista laughed it sounded so forced and it seemed like an effort for him to even deal with cena
1001256 sometimes i think the environment in which we operate is entirely too secular the fact that we have freedom of religion does not mean we need to try to have freedom from religion doesnt mean that those of us who have faith shouldnt frankly admit that we are animated by faith that we try to live by it and that it does affect what we feel what we think and what we do
1001257 it is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves
1001258 one wolf is evil and ugly he is anger envy war greed self pity sorrow regret guilt resentment inferiority lies false pride superiority selfishness and arrogance
1001259 the other wolf is beautiful and good he is friendly joyful peace love hope serenity humility kindness benevolence justice fairness empathy generosity true compassion gratitude and deep vision
1001260 this same fight is going on inside you and inside every other human as well
1001261 excuse me for interrupting but i want doug to see that im not stealing these
1001262 ive got a story once this guy stole a 150 saw blade and ran out of the store into the parking lot i fired up the forklift another employee jumped on and we chased him down the other employee jumped off and tackled the guy

1001265 furthermore plans unless specifically designated for tethering usage cannot be used for any applications that tether the device through use of including without limitation connection kits other phone pda to computer accessories bluetooth or any other wireless technology to personal computers including without limitation laptops or other equipment for any purpose
1001266 the app may not violate a terms of service agreement of a different iphone carrier but in the us it does violate at amp ts tos
1001267 apple has separate app stores for the countries it looks like its an apple up selling it in the us app store
1001268 at the very least we hope apple will allow it to be used in countries where the provider does permit tethering
1001269 you know i was born the same week as you

1001271 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
1001272 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
1001273 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
1001274 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
1001275 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
1001276 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
1001277 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
1001278 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
1001279 at the same time for some people hair loss can be a really traumatic thing especially for women
1001280 if you look at the rising price of petroleum the rising price of food around the world we are all going to have to re examine how we produce food where we produce it how we consume it
1001281 its not just a question of energy prices its not just a question of global warming its a question of how we are going to keep our kids alive
1001282 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
1001283 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body
1001284 but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
1001285 problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together
1001286 the required removal of shoes at the security checkpoint is one of the biggest complaints we get from passengers so we are trying something new that will allow us to maintain a high level of security while accommodating travelers

1001294 there is not a chance trencher will ever appear in another comic book
1001295 ive moved on the character doesnt interest me anymore never say never but never
1001296 if i leave the heckler alone long enough dc will have to give him back
1001297 it didnt feel revolutionary at all it just turned out different
1001298 we were more interested in the characters without the mask than with the mask there was a faction at dc who believed we should take the humor out of the book
1001299 people down the hall from me know when i get the pages to
1001300 i have two giggles ambush bug gets the biggest laugh
1001301 its not such an ability im not doing anything different than other creators they think it i say it

1001303 meanwhile there are artists ethan van sciver for instance tells editors up front this is the amount of work i can do

1001305 any inker that follows me and adds something most inkers are pretty conscientious
1001306 it was either the comic book business or a bell tower with a high profile rifle
1001307 52 was a series in hindsight it was a series of really good ideas that never should have happened
1001308 at the time dc was pissed at me and i was pissed at them when i blew up the moon that was a plot point when i blew up earth that was a temper tantrum
1001309 im keeping my eye on that part of town thats for sure
1001310 i appreciate that youre wearing a helmet and youre riding on the street like youre supposed to

1001312 i want the people of huntington beach to know what they are getting into and i dont think anybody has a clue
1001313 i think they would be best served to postpone his hiring
1001314 turners disjointed collection of statements are not based on fact and they reflect his extremeist view points and typical hyperbole
1001315 i think what i bring to the table is a long career in public administration
1001316 the issues are going to be different because san bernardino is in the inland empire and huntington beach is a coastal city

1001359 disengage with the term obese and believe that it does not relate to their child
1001360 explored the use of the word obese and the vast majority of parents were adamant that this should not be used especially when discussing children
1001361 the department of healths decision not to tell parents the exact bmi of their children but to give them only some vague sliding scale of where their children are on the bmi range is rubbish
1001362 it will not deliver the demand that the chief medical officer made in 2003 that the early signs of unhealthy weight need to be identified
1001363 although the department recognises that there is no better way of calculating healthy unhealthy weight other than using bmi and mistakenly states that bmi growth charts can be found in the childs personal child health records it states that some parents might find bmi charts confusing
1001364 the department of healths solution not to give anyone a bmi figure for their children in either reception year or year 6
1001365 this flies in the face of the departments policy recognising that parents are the principal care givers and denies them knowledge
1001366 diabetes uk welcomes this move as it is extremely worrying that many parents cannot see if their child is overweight
1001367 parents need to be educated about the dangers of obesity and obesity related conditions such as type 2 diabetes
1001368 i find this particular line from the government tip toeing through the daffodils
1001369 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice
1001370 its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
1001371 when we got to the area his friends had uncovered his head then we concentrated on uncovering his torso
1001372 the family were shouting at him to help himself believing that he was conscious and able to help us
1001373 there must have been two tonnes of sand on top of him
1001374 we didnt know which way his body was lying behind him or in front
1001375 he and his friends must have spent the best part of the day to have dug two deep holes and a tunnel connecting them
1001376 the sand would have been wet and firm to begin with but once the tunnel was dug air would have got in and dried it out and thats why it collapsed
1001377 they were pretty hysterical there was a lot of crying and a lot of screaming
1001378 the family were saying help yourself help them get you out
1001379 im 60 now and 40 years ago was the last time this happened and that was a good four miles away but it was a similar type of sand
1001380 for all we know perhaps people are digging tunnels here all the time
1001381 its only when a tragedy happens that you find out about it
1001382 the message has to be its safe to come here the dunes are beautiful just dont dig holes here
1001383 we were on the beach when everyone suddenly started running towards the dunes
1001384 i couldnt watch but i heard later he had died
1001385 kids play in the dunes but no one realised the dangers of how a bit of adventure can lead to someone losing their life
1001386 a huge tunnel had been dug that people were able to walk through
1001387 but it became unsteady and unfortunately collapsed around the young boy
1001388 he was trapped in the sand for approximately 20 minutes
1001389 its just a tragic accident that could have been prevented but unfortunately children dont see danger
1001390 people think that the sea is the danger when they are at the beach but sand can be a killer too
1001391 wet sand as we had on sunday after rain makes it easier for tunnelling but sand is very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
1001392 we have had a lot of rainfall over the last few days the sand had become quite compact and obviously very dense as well i believe the tunnel was huge they were able to walk through and it became unsteady and unfortunately collapsed around the young boy its just a tragic accident that could have been prevented but unfortunately children dont see danger sand is always very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
1001393 a flat spot makes you more vulnerable to a puncture
1001394 because it makes the tyre thinner in that area and therefore you have less protection against debris damage

1001525 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
1001526 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
1001527 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
1001528 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops
1001529 its not just matrix of natural areas with agriculture mixed in but a patchwork quilt with animals using all of the areas in the landscape
1001530 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1001531 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west

1001534 transportation cuts in 2008 have been dominated by airlines which are reeling from higher fuel prices and cutting flights amenities and workers to offset their costs at the same time many cash strapped americans are increasingly frustrated by higher ticket prices baggage fees airport delays and cancelled flights that they are simply forgoing vacations that require air travel and staying closer to home
1001535 meanwhile financial firms are just 52 330 job cuts away from breaking last years record total at the current pace we could surpass the 2007 year end figure of 153 105 by the end of october
1001536 at the same time we have seen job cuts increase in the majority of industries that we track indicating that the downturn which was isolated to the housing and financial sectors just a few months ago has spread throughout much of the economy while the latest reading on gross domestic product confirms that we have not yet fallen into recession the big worry is that the economy will continue to under perform if that persists for several quarters or even years it will seem like we are in a recession particularly for job seekers

1001541 we already know that approximately 25 of men and 9 of women in the middle age bracket in australia stop breathing during sleep at least five times per hour
1001542 however because sleep apnea is strongly associated with obesity and its related diseases it has been difficult in the past to produce clear evidence that increased mortality is a result of osa and not because of other established causes
1001543 that evidence is now available and shows that moderate to severe sleep apnea is associated with about five times the risk of dying after you control for other factors that are already known to cause premature death
1001544 there is a need for high quality clinical trials looking at treatments for sleep apnea that are large enough and long enough to find out whether we can prevent disease or reduce mortality risk
1001545 obstructive sleep apnea is a deadly disease and it is now time for public health and medical practitioners as well as the general public to take it seriously
1001546 the health profession needs to look closely at ways of detecting sleep apnea in children adolescents and young adults to prevent sleep apnea in the over 40 years age group
1001547 sleep apnea prevention is different to obesity prevention as genetic factors related to facial shape and structure also play a role in pathogenesis

1001609 they dont get it they dont understand the realities of their business
1001610 the potential exists to tie in what happened on castle hill to what happened in the community below
1001611 we can only come for a maximum of 10 days so if the request was to build a building we wouldnt be able to do it
1001612 anybody and everybody thats been involved with the meals have donated all their food the community outside has been phenomenal just amazing theyve really opened arms
1001613 im really amazed at the community everybody has been bending over backwards and it has been absolutely amazing
1001614 the 91 air field engineer flight is a fully deployable primary reserve unit we are made up of regular forces and primary reserves
1001615 all our tradesmen were trained with the regular forces have the same basic training and attended the same trade school we augment the regular force anywhere we always have people ready to go if a unit from greenwood or trenton is missing a carpenter because he or she is going over for deployment anywhere in the world we also provide back up for them
1001616 another thing is we can hire up to 59 trades people right from the street and at any time we always have openings
1001617 its a great opportunity for anyone coming out of school who wants to be a carpenter or electrician and doesnt want to pay for the trade school we pay for all the training and we pay them to go to school with the primary reserves they can do all the trade qualifications and then they can quit there is no obligation so its a win win situation
1001618 this to us is not only a wonderful thing happening but its a saving of at least 20 thousand
1001619 last year we had all our facts and figures and we had to walk away because we dont have that kind of drawing power
1001620 well there were only three people they were utilizing other forms of treatments for either m s or crohns disease when they contracted pml now the touch protocol is in place there hasnt been a case of pml in the last two years and more than 26 000 people are on the ty train
1001621 more cases of pml are likely and physicians are likely to reduce the number of patients they start on the drug as they are reminded of long term potential safety issues
1001622 you are a traitor to your race you banana coconut aunt tomasina white wannabe
1001623 if you give thomas a little flour on his face youd think you had former klansman david duke
1001624 a shill for the most insidious form of racism but also a man whose views are
1001625 i hope thomass wife feeds him lots of eggs and butter and he dies early like many black men do of heart disease hes an absolutely reprehensible person
1001626 i have told thomas i am ashamed of him because he is becoming to the black community what benedict arnold was to the nation he deserted and what judas iscariot was to jesus a
1001627 maim and kill other blacks for the gratification and entertainment of ultraconservative white racists
1001628 a new breed of uncle tom and some of the biggest liars the world ever saw
1001629 when white folks cant defeat you theyll always find some negro some boot licking butt licking bamboozled half baked half fried sissified punkified pasteurized homogenized nigger that they can trot out in front of you
1001630 when we blacks opposed the notion that we all looked alike and talked alike but somehow we have come to exalt the new black stereotype above all and demand conformity to that norm however i assert my right to think for myself to refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as though i was an intellectual slave because im black
1001631 housing project was set up for you to move in move up and move out

1001635 prior to the passage of the unlawful internet gambling act of 2006 on october 13 2006 federal law was both vague and outdated regarding internet gambling activities
1001636 the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others a sporting event or a game subject to chance

1001638 no provision in this act shall be construed as clarifying or implying that internet bets or wagers other than sports bets or wagers which were accepted subsequent to october 13 2006 are in violation of federal law

1001641 open up your exploration in algeria we have a bidding round going on we are open the u s also needs to open offshore florida offshore alaska need to be opened to exploration
1001642 is an area that may have large volumes of recoverable oil we think that the outer continental shelf will give access to new areas we think that part of this constraint on supply right now comes from areas that you cannot go and the u s is one area that is limited to increased exploration
1001643 the limits to future petroleum supplies have more to do with politics than with geology and resource availability for example the most promising acreage remaining in the u s is located offshore most of which is off limits to the industry

1001645 the carthusian father master needs to be extremely open and highly
1001646 this book could be my best friend when im in the bathroom and im not just saying that because im out of toilet paper or a friend to wipe for me
1001647 the stories in crazy little things find author adam p knave at his best offering readers a taste of literary cyanide served with a grin much in keeping with the spirit of the late great robert bloch
1001648 im very very happy i know how hard weve worked and how hard the team has worked to bring forward upgrades for our car and we made some significant improvements in the last few months
1001649 talking to the team was a happy moment mainly because everyone has worked really hard
1001650 i feel satisfied of course for myself to have achieved this result and regardless of circumstances in formula one you dont have any style points its ten points end of story
1001651 we have to really look at it we lost about five seconds and we think it is partly temperature
1001652 when you get these high temperatures you get a bit of pressure coming out of the tank
1001653 i was quite surprised by this it was very sweet
1001654 im going to make an exhibition of this beautiful present in my home
1001655 now i see a fernando that is a lot more relaxed he knows the difficulty of his situation this year but hes getting on with it
1001656 we have not found the actual cause but there is a high possibility of a puncture
1001657 we could not see any debris on the tread surface although we could not analyse the shoulder area because he ran half of a lap with a depressed front tyre and the sidewalls were badly damaged
1001658 but for sure reliability because we cannot accept to have these kind of problems even if it was only 10 kilometres from the end we cannot have this problem of reliability because we are paying too much of a price for it
1001659 on the other hand qualifying is crucial and the difference today was really the fact that on one side we were able to jump in front and do our race as we were able to do and on the other hand in the first part in the middle of the field knowing that it was really impossible to do something in spite of having the right pace
1001660 what we need to improve is looking ahead above all at the next grand prix where maybe there will be tricky conditions in terms of temperature in terms of the situation weather something like that for sure we need to prepare our cars and tyre set up maybe in a different way because we saw what we suffered for example in germany
1001661 as we stand here today we intend to keep both drivers
1001662 and i dont think thats ever been in any doubt to be honest
1001663 im just happy that he had a really strong race here jarno would have had a stronger race if he hadnt been caught behind mark webber because of a bad start overall im very happy we had a strong result today
1001664 certainly from the moment he drove out of the garage on friday he has been on it all weekend
1001665 if you really look at his sector times from qualifying earlier in the season he was struggling to put a complete lap together but generally showing he had the speed to do it
1001666 he proved to himself in hockenheim particularly on race pace how quick he was and the fact he had an issue and he just continued from that point this weekend
1001667 todays result is a solid and encouraging one for the whole team our two drivers did a great job and we are now ready to continue pushing hard in the second half of the season to finish in fourth place in the constructors championship
1001668 i am happy with my result this weekend i scored some valuable points which is promising for the rest of the season i made a good start but unfortunately i made a small mistake on the first lap which meant that i lost the two positions that i had made up it shows that at this level you cannot afford to make the smallest error
1001669 if we had been out in front then it perhaps would have been a little bit different
1001670 but hungary showed they had some really strong pace which we already knew they had its just you guys the media seem to think theres a huge difference
1001671 i think i drove well i didnt make any mistakes i just had a puncture i brought the car home as safe as possible and scored as many points as i could so theres not much more you can ask for
1001672 its just unfortunate i was the one to get a puncture and it was a case of oh no not again i had it three times last year or whatever it was and thats what really lost me the championship
1001673 it can be very very costly but kimi didnt win and it actually helps heikki has won and glock was second they are taking points off everyone else so im quite happy
1001674 my lead is bigger now and you would never have thought that with all that has gone on this year
1001675 im going to make sure i work very hard and that physically i am well prepared for the rest of the season
1001676 im going to make sure we keep up with the performance we have and i think youve seen that here
1001677 in the second stint i was quite a bit heavier than felipe and i was keeping up with him and catching him sometimes i think i showed pretty good pace this weekend that i still continue to have the strong pace that i have in races
1001678 i think me and felipe were the quickest out there and so its still good to have that
1001679 i had one of my best ever starts but felipe had an even better one
1001680 i havent been to my real home in north finland for a long time so i think i will go there at the end of the week
1001681 i will celebrate the day with my people in suomussalmi village where im from
1001682 ive a little karting race organised on saturday which has become a tradition for the last five or six years but now it will be a very special event having won this race
1001683 it will be nice to go and see my people there my family but then it will be back to business although i will even try to get something out of the break
1001684 ill spend a bit of time in woking talking to the engineers and preparing for the next race european grand prix valencia
1001685 this win doesnt turn my world completely upside down even if there was a two month break now
1001686 im happy about it but this is just part of the goal i set myself because now the next goal is to repeat this and then after that to do it again
1001687 we just need to keep up our concentration all the time
1001688 of course i feel a little sorry for felipe and even for lewis because they both drove a great race
1001689 but i know how they feel because ive had similar moments myself this year quite a few times
1001690 after saturday ive been in a position to fight for the victory but something has always gone wrong something hasnt functioned perfectly
1001691 so to stand on the top step of the podium and to hear the finnish anthem playing for me was fantastic
1001692 rudy people dont change until they are ready people dont change because they may not want to

1001694 after deciding to let the nazis assume power at one time
1001695 the dpj won a sweeping victory in last years upper house election but does it aim to win power
1001696 if so the dpj needs to act in a more responsible manner
1001697 not make such an unreasonable choice i dont think the public see the dpj in such a way
1001698 i only said it is important to deliberate matters seriously in the upper house
1001699 in linking us to the nazis this remark could give the impression that if the dpj assumes power it will embark upon oppressive politics
1001700 time will tell i hope it wont its a way ive been successful with so far in my career and something i want to try and keep at a real high level
1001701 the way i play is very gut instinct orientated and i like to do things spontaneously i like to do what i feel is right in a situation
1001702 i think over the years ive played cricket ive gained a good cricket brain my gut instinct when ive been batting for england has assisted me tremendously its a brand new challenge for me and i love challenges
1001703 huge boots to try and fill michael was a great leader and a great friend
1001704 you could see how emotional michael was when he spoke about his family and its an emotional decision
1001705 he likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters in the dressing room and a lot of opinionated people i sat down with peter and we had a real good discussion about how we want to take this team forward i think my position from a player to a captain is totally different and we need to unite and to get on the same hymn sheet
1001706 i will always respect what happened in the past and i will always ask for advice im fresh into this and i will need some help one of the most exciting things is that i have had text messages and phone calls from senior members in the squad who have said they are right behind me
1001707 i havent even thought that far ahead my concern this week is about how we can salvage pride from this series
1001708 hopefully i am going to bat exactly the same way the way colly paul collingwood and i played is exactly the way you need to play against south africa and against australia you have to be positive and aggressive

1001718 ustaz bagaimanakah caranya untuk saya mengelakkan diri daripada bercinta semasa belajar apakah kaedah yang boleh digunakan
1001719 oleh kerana kita sudah berbicara tentang kuasa cinta maka saya berpandangan cinta tidak boleh dilawan dan tidak boleh dilayan untuk menjadi mangsa kuasa cinta tidak perlu melayan cinta sebaliknya melawan cinta juga sama kesannya
1001720 mereka ini keliru antara seseorang yang mendakwa orang lain melakukan zina dengan orang yang mendakwa dirinya dirogol dan diliwat
1001721 jika disamakan kaedah ini bererti mangsa mangsa rogol dan liwat kena datangkan empat orang saksi dan kalau gagal berbuat demikian mereka akan disebat 80 kali inikah islam yang mereka faham
1001722 kesalahan memahami hukum beginilah yang akan mengelirukan umat islam jika ini yang ditonjolkan pada masyarakat maka orang akan anggap islam itu zalim
1001723 jika dia tidak melakukan kepada saya laknat allah kepada saya jika saya melakukannya laknat allah kepada saya
1001724 sebenarnya seseorang yang mendakwa dirogol atau diliwat boleh menguatkan kes dan tidak semestinya mengemukakan empat orang saksi saja pendakwa boleh mengemukakan qarinah bukti atau apa saja yang berkaitan untuk membantu siasatan
1001725 dapatkah dicari empat orang saksi beriman di mana pula di dunia ini ada orang yang dirogol disaksikan empat orang saksi beriman dan saksi saksi itu pula akan hanya melihat saja tanpa melarang perbuatan itu
1001726 mubahalah lain prosedur mahkamah lain mubahalah timbul akibat ada pihak yang tak percaya pada sistem kehakiman percaya ada komplot bila masyarakat tidak mempercayai satu sama lain bila saksi dianggap palsu mahkamah pula tidak boleh dipercayai

1001728 i dont know because i havent seen any data from the weather today but we are most concerned about the athletes so lets wait and see
1001729 im going to get the weather forecast for the coming days
1001730 im not an expert i want to see the figures we see the figures every day

1001734 it is not our decision because when the cas is taking a decision we are bound by that decision we have to accept the decisions of a tribunal
1001735 but i do hope that even if the ruling is against the players that the clubs would say ok we are now right and weve a right to attack fifa but let the players play
1001736 this is what i am asking and we will directly also ask the clubs to do so if the ruling is negative for the players we shall protect first of all the players
1001737 first of all we have to go for three points and hopefully we can start stacking up the goals
1001738 new zealand are a young team and have recently been gaining international experience but we cannot lose our focus and relax we have analyzed their tactics and prepared accordingly
1001739 the u s are a strong team in our group but generally speaking germany are the strongest team of course japan are strong too
1001740 we aim to physically dominate japan we are a strong team physically and mentally
1001741 we have come through tough times and they have made us stronger and we believe we can take three points from the game
1001742 if japan are so sure they will take three points and if they remember the new zealand team they beat 6 0 three years ago then we will be very happy we have a different team now and a different spirit and belief
1001743 we are perceived as underdogs but as captain i know we have spirit and do not believe we are underdogs we can match other teams
1001744 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1001745 it was exciting to pitch in a great atmosphere here i wanted to meet the expectations of fans
1001746 as the game progressed i began to think i have to throw a complete game
1001747 interferes with the issue which is who should be elected in november
1001748 now i will be glad as soon as this election is over in january to have this conversation with you and everybody else i have very strong feelings about it
1001749 ive heard it from the press and i will not comment on it there are things i wished i said things i wished i hadnt said but i am not a racist i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack him personally
1001750 a different standard was applied to the finest candidate i ever supported
1001751 he hit her hard a couple times and they hit us a few weeks before she ever responded in kind
1001752 the only thing i ever got mad about people in your line of work pretending that she had started negative stuff its contact sport
1001753 i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution and id be the last person to begrudge anybody their ambition
1001754 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1001755 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1001756 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1001757 barack obamas latest attack ads shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1001758 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1001759 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1001760 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1001761 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1001762 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
1001763 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down

1001782 dad died when i was 17 so i stupidly thought that this would be quite a romantic notion to find out about my ancestors i just didnt realise it was going to be so sad
1001783 i was so livid with him that i hit rock bottom i kept thinking how stupid i was to think that i could deal with this i genuinely didnt want to know any more
1001784 it hit me so hard i stopped washing my hair and wearing make up
1001785 i was so depressed that i started binge eating on burgers and pie and mash i was so scared of how it was affecting me that i said i cant do this any more and went home and locked myself away
1001786 when the vicar told me his work was so valuable that they were going to write a book about him i felt a huge weight coming off my shoulders it was an astonishing story
1001787 that was the moment i stopped eating burgers and started washing my hair
1001788 ive regretted that ever since so i thought im going to see this through im so glad i did
1001789 telling my own personal story like this is not something im used to
1001790 but when i saw that horse wagon used to transport jews to their deaths in concentration camps i didnt care about the cameras or who was watching me

1001798 est claro que entre los rivales el schalke es un equipo grande y que lleva mucho tiempo en la champions pero
1001799 de momento no hay ning n favorito es a dos partidos el primero fuera y el segundo en casa pero es una eliminatoria en la que nos enfrentamos dos equipos muy competitivos y se decidir en los dos partidos

1002051 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
1002052 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks for our mission critical applications this experience demonstrates the value companies looking at virtualized recovery solutions can gain by tapping sungards expertise rather than handling internally
1002053 server virtualization will dramatically change the it recovery services model for both the services provider and the customer with replication to a shared storage infrastructure and a virtualized server infrastructure customers can enjoy improved recovery time and recovery point objectives without the cost of dedicated and custom recovery solutions from the dr service provider

1002055 a recovery strategy with no off site data may mean quite possibly no recovery virtual server replication services provides organizations an affordable way to have access to a secondary data center for protection of physical and virtual it environments

1002224 its still littlebigplanet but people will be saying i thought it was this now youre telling me its this as well that excites me hugely
1002225 i would love there to be a littlebigplanet universe of content with a game like this the number of directions and the breadth that you could take in while keeping it in a self contained universe is insane
1002226 the big thing thing there is that weve got into a real habit of throwing stuff out earlier testing it and showing it earlier
1002227 a lot of people ask when will littlebigplanet be done for gods sake this is the quickest game ive ever worked on to me this is an in and out job done sort of thing

1002318 i was completely overwhelmed by the response i received in toronto
1002319 i wasnt sure what kind of reaction i was going to get when i stepped out in front of that crowd yes if you havent heard i played a role in the show in addition to just signing autographs and i was absolutely blown away its good to know fans remember and appreciate my past efforts and i cant thank them enough for the reception they gave me

1002324 i think he is a detriment to the wrestling business and i dont think he has ever ever been successful in the business
1002325 i do not consider him an asset to the wrestling business in any way
1002326 bob carter has a lot of money but he dont have enough to compete with vince mcmahon you cant buy competition with vince vince is a third generation promoter he knows the wrestling business his life is the wrestling business 24 7 i can tell you that because i am one of the few people that stayed in his home with him and linda unless you have the same kind of credentials in the wrestling business the same kind of money and most importantly the same kind of dedication you cannot compete ted turner could not compete
1002327 if you have every show you can probably know when i quit booking probably show 25 27 28 because the emphasis was on wrestling
1002328 he was a huge huge wrestling fan and was one of the finest people i ever met

1002340 i think youll find that no plan covers this procedure its highly likely
1002341 weve classified it as investigational and experimental we look at a couple of things the literature is important anything thats been recognized in a peer reviewed journal
1002342 we still are traveling every two weeks for her to meet with dr upledger
1002343 shes really tight across her lower back and hes totally been focused on loosening up all of the tension thats what helped her having bowel movements on her own
1002344 im a parent and if i had a kid that was stuck between a rock and a hard place and no conventional methods would work i would look to alternative methods
1002345 if it feels good great but as a medical provider show me the medical results proof is not subjective
1002346 this therapy is doing exactly what the american medical association described it should do
1002347 it increases pain free motion increases extensibility of her tissues and to help the patient return to normal functional activities she can live with a 70 degree curve now
1002348 craniosacral therapy is about as ridiculous and bogus as it could get
1002349 because the idea behind it is that by putting the hand on a persons head that you can move the plates in the skull thats absurd its not supported by medicine

1002359 the reason the whole sienna fling happened was because he fell off the wagon he stopped ringing his counselor and stopped going to meetings him not being sober is the key to the whole mess as soon as balthy arrived back in la he started pleading with his wife to take him back he told me hed gone to their house and stood outside crying he was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling in his mind he has definitely dropped sienna

1002361 my suggestion remains that believing christians and jews should get out of the
1002362 implies that the apprehension of truth is a growing thing we only gradually succeed in knowing the truth
1002363 we view this as an exciting next step in providing real support for the battered mainstream of our anglican communion
1002364 we believe that the autonomy of national churches and the ability of dioceses and parishes to engage in diversity within the context of the canons and customs of the church are principles most mainstream anglicans support

1002370 the debates about sexuality significant as they may be are symptoms of our confusion about these basic principles of recognition
1002371 this is so loaded its written in an open ended fashion that anybody can take just about any part of it and grow it into a huge monstrosity
1002372 most groups have ended because 1 they joined the political process or 2 local police and intelligence agencies arrested or killed key members military force has rarely been the primary reason for the end of terrorist groups
1002373 that cannot or will not make a transition to nonviolence policing is likely to be the most effective strategy
1002374 a fter september 11 2001 the u s strategy against al qaida centered on the use of military force
1002375 u s policymakers and key national security documents referred to operations against al qaida as the war on terrorism emphasis in original
1002376 the evidence by 2008 suggested that the u s strategy was not successful in undermining al qaidas capabilities
1002377 resurgence should trigger a fundamental rethinking of u s counterterrorism strategy
1002378 policing and intelligence should be the backbone of u s efforts
1002379 military force may be a necessary instrument when is involved in an insurgency
1002380 they have a better understanding of the operating environment even if they need to develop the capacity to deal with insurgent groups over the long run
1002381 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
1002382 economic political and social development in vulnerable corners of the world
1002383 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development
1002384 the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves

1002386 by hollywood standards maybe one would say that the first one wasnt as successful as other films in truth

1002388 while it had a nice core audience it wasnt a huge success at the box office so i was a little surprised when we came back to do the second one

1002406 a large majority of iranians strongly believe that iran has the same right as other nations to develop nuclear energy including the construction and operation of nuclear enrichment facilities

1002430 there are more than 75 unique components and more than 50 different buildings to be built from those components
1002431 the game is somewhat sandbox like in design there are no distinct levels just a growing changing world like youd find in other city builders there is a tech tree to explore but theres plenty of room for taking a custom path and making a lot of personal decisions on how and when and where to build what different decisions affect the general flow of the kingdom in different ways so its fun to play the game again and do things differently there are also quests that players can follow to earn more points and get upgrades or they can be completely ignored

1002482 obama is selling an economic plan that is completely dependent on being able to get out of iraq

1002490 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
1002491 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
1002492 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
1002493 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
1002494 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
1002495 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in

1002500 everyone is entitled to their own opinion i happen to believe shes a great player
1002501 it is one of the toughest decisions ive had to make in golf turning down the pga i was torn with it

1002503 ive always run from it to tell you the truth ive always been trying to hide from attention but this year for some reason i feel like i can prove a point it may not happen i may fall flat on my face that ryder cup week it may be too much pressure too much burden that i cant handle it i dont know
1002504 to me him not being here is probably the difference between 38th and 39th so i dont miss him but im sure the boys up in the big money end they definitely notice a difference

1002513 i played great i really played well i played great today i felt like i should have shot 63 or 64 had countless birdie opportunities from 6 to 15 feet and then i make three bogeys on the last four holes and turn a 64 into a 70

1002516 when users call methods that are not valid in the current state of the object an invalidoperationexception should be thrown clearly explain ing what properties need to be changed to get the object into a valid state
1002517 is the problem due to the abstraction level of the api
1002518 i would add an open and close method to the contract open would be the only method that could initiate a connection close would be the method that would always close a connection and spill the instance on the service open would take a key that would identify the app session being dealt with the service would be storing data in a database or in a file whatever works for the particular app
1002519 i think it is very clear they did not want to capture bin laden
1002520 i think the evidence indicates that very clearly bin laden was close to being captured in december 2001 there was a clear understanding of where he was heading up to tora bora in those mountains he could have been captured
1002521 but there was a decision that was made through the pentagon and probably that decision had been made outside the pentagon as well within the administration not to aggressively pursue bin laden
1002522 i believe that the reason for that was that if bin laden had been captured it would have been very difficult if not impossible for this administration to then justify an attack against another country

1002536 i wish i wanted it as much as i used to but i dont
1002537 ive been with her for 10 years a lot of wins she hit every green today it is the sign of a champion to come out when you dont have a chance of winning and play like that shes great nobodys done it better ill never forget this
1002538 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
1002539 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
1002540 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
1002541 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
1002542 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you
1002543 the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit that perfect 6 iron and make that putt

1002553 i didnt have much in the tank it was all i had im pretty spent right now
1002554 i was trying to force an issue a little bit too much with that lie i hit a horrible shot and then tried something to get it up there far enough and turned that into a triple and the tournaments over
1002555 i thought maybe if i made that putt on 14 for par and maybe i can get a little momentum back but i missed that and the doors closed at that point
1002556 everything was a positive except for my back nine yesterday and today
1002557 im disappointed right now and i havent closed the deal yet this year and that upsets me more than anything ive been in position now five or six times to win and havent come away with it and theres some things i need to do ill figure it out

1002571 one example is a national identification card and data base long desired by some in government and which was mandated by legislation passed by the congress in 2005 with the support of both senators mccain and obama although i was no longer in the congress when this bad legislation was passed i had vigorously opposed it in the years since it became law just as i led the successful effort to rescind a previous mandate for a national id card
1002572 the real id act establishes a new and privacy invasive national id card program by forcing states to standardize their drivers licenses and creating a vast national data base of private information on the citizenry the law establishes through the back door something americans would never have accepted directly a national identification card
1002573 there was no open and honest vote on real id the mandate was slipped into a supplemental appropriations bill discouraging any real debate over the issue
1002574 creating anything close to a national id card threatens americans basic civil liberties and privacy while doing little or nothing to make us more secure
1002575 means higher fees longer lines and greater inconvenience for americans getting a drivers license the burden on states which have to redesign and remake state licenses and include all manner of information on citizens applying for new drivers licenses would be extremely high and immensely costly since they would have to restructure computer databases security systems verification measures and more
1002576 technically no one has to have a federally approved license
1002577 that is unless you want to get on an airplane or visit a u s courthouse a veterans affairs hospital a social security office or any other federal building americans once could live their lives with minimal contact with the federal government but that is impossible today
1002578 but the onus for dealing with real id falls on congress
1002579 as president i would submit legislation to repeal the law i also would use my authority as president to limit the laws impact to the extent allowed by law establishing privacy safeguards extending compliance deadlines and relaxing license requirements protecting the peoples liberties and privacy is central to governments role not an afterthought factors obviously not important to my opponents in both the republican and democratic parties who supported the real id act

1002584 new towns represent sustainable development with the added beauty of providing all the desired elements roads power water good communications schools hospitals recreational and other amenities and in particular security in fact it would be possible to designate some if not all of these towns as company towns each town would have an economic base thus employment for all employable nigerians would be provided during and after the development of these new towns
1002585 the political leadership in the niger delta has failed the people much is expected from leaders like ministers from the region but they have become of insignificant value the governors too are like their predecessors they are neither here nor there but they will definitely account for every kobo they received while in office

1002668 perception of social responsibility remains critical to garnering college students
1002669 although most students are judging corporate social responsibility via advertising and branding they are quick to castigate the brands who they believe are not authentically and consistently committed
1002670 we are extremely honored to again be recognized by college students as a top socially responsible brand it makes me incredibly optimistic about the future to see youth demanding socially and environmentally conscious behaviors of companies

1002712 we have very effective treatments for cancer in adolescents but they only work if the patient takes them
1002713 this study shows that a strategically designed video game can be a powerful new tool to enhance the impact of medical treatment by motivating healthy behavior in the patient
1002714 we now know that games can induce positive changes in the way individuals manage their health
1002715 the game not only motivates positive health behavior it also gives players a greater sense of power and control over their disease in fact that seems to be its key ingredient

1002722 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomisation of the query id and the source port essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response
1002723 however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my os x 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomise the source port
1002724 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1002725 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
1002726 in these cases the network device performing pat port address translation uses a predictable source port allocation policy such as incremental allocation when performing the layer 4 rewrite operation that is necessary for pat

1002731 further to recent press speculation centrica confirms that it is in discussions with a third party with a view to centrica taking a minority ownership position in british energy subject to various conditions including this third party successfully acquiring british energy and receipt of regulatory clearances
1002732 in the event that the third party does not proceed with an offer for british energy or centricas discussions with the third party do not result in an agreement centrica might consider a number of other alternatives with respect to british energy
1002733 these alternatives may include a possible merger of centrica with british energy only if terms could be agreed and if all parties are fully supportive

1002736 we have reverted to the underlying fundamentals where oil prices are higher and the stock market not looking too good so in the coming days dollar demand is expected to be fairly strong
1002737 oil prices have rebounded from 120 per barrel levels so the underlying fact is that there is scope for the rupee to depreciate we may see the rupee at 42 80 43 00 levels by the end of this week
1002738 now buyers will be interested only if prices fall closer to 12 000 rupees per 10 grams

1002757 new zealands law does not go as far as the dmca in the us but it is unjust nonetheless
1002758 drm is nearly always the result of a conspiracy of companies to restrict the technology available to the public such conspiracy should be a crime and the executives responsible for it should be sentenced to prison
1002759 free software means that people are free to cooperate and control their own computing
1002760 you dont find malicious features in free software because the users are in control
1002761 non free proprietary software keeps the users divided and helpless divided because each user is forbidden to share it and helpless because the users dont have the source code so they cant even tell what its doing to them
1002762 to use proprietary software is to invite the developer to put his boot on your neck its power that nobody should have
1002763 i dont have any other specific plans but id be happy to talk with any other free software developers about useful kinds of cooperation
1002764 is based on ethical values of freedom and social solidarity
1002765 we reject non free software regardless of what practical advantages or disadvantages it may have because one uses it at the price of ones freedom
1002766 many geeks who prefer not to think about ethical issues chose the gnu linux system for its practical advantages and some of them also contributed to its development
1002767 however they coined the term open source in 1998 in order to talk about the same corpus of free software more or less but without alluding to ethical issues and values
1002768 i respect their right to their views but people with their views would never have sought to produce a completely free operating system the reason we have one is because of people who do care about freedom
1002769 each software patent is a government imposed monopoly on implementing some computational idea or technique any software developer or computer user that implements the technique can get sued for it thus you as a developer or user can be sued by parties unknown to you over the ideas in the code that you wrote or the system that you set up
1002770 the best solution to this problem is not to allow software patents however in countries that do all developers and distributors are likely to be threatened as red hat was by firestar and datatern a dispute settled last month
1002771 that is why gpl version 3 requires companies that redistribute to get licences that cover all their downstream users
1002772 the megacorporations cross license with each other and can force anyone else except a patent troll to cross license with them too thus they avoid most of the harm and patents give them a sort of control over their field
1002773 the us government generally works for the megacorporations so it tries to bully other countries into allowing software patents governments that are inclined to bow down to the megacorporations give in but they shouldnt
1002774 the hidden value of school desegregation evidence on integrations high school promoting power from the cleveland municipal school district 1977 1998
1002775 we have not properly integrated this insight in our ways of evaluating educational reform
1002776 so long as we refuse to include significant remedies to non school problems in our efforts to improve urban education and to close the achievement gap we should examine school contribution in addition to student performance as a legitimate criterion for policy outcomes

1002819 the assessment of discovered and undiscovered gas is based on statistical methodology so we look at whats called pool size distributions discovered and undiscovered and we can make an estimate of how many undiscovered pools are left and the size of those pools im also on the canadian gas potential committee a group of senior geoscientists that prepares periodic national assessments of canadas discovered and undiscovered gas resources and in our most recent assessment on the conventional gas side in the western canada sedimentary basin the two thirds of the gas that we found were contained in 44 000 pools the one third of the gas that we havent discovered yet is contained in 500 000 pools and the last 200 000 300 000 pools on that tail will be far too small to be commercially developed so roughly 90 of whats left of the undiscovered resources are contained in probably 250 000 pools it takes us two wells to find each one thats 500 000 wells to find the last 30 of canadas gas to put that in perspective weve drilled 300 000 wells to find the first 70 so we can see thats the treadmill the law of diminishing returns

1002832 this was particularly important when stating facts about a recent historic event such as the wars of the former republic of yugoslavia which were a matter of political controversy
1002833 the comment on the destruction of the mostar bridge in which it was stated that there was no reason for the destruction was inaccurate
1002834 there was an innocence and an excitement to the shows of this era that can never be replicated its like the first season of the real world it was genuinely interesting because no one knew what was going to happen the participants of every subsequent season and every reality show that followed knew they could get famous from it so it became fake everyone knows that there is money or a hollywood deal to be made on the web now so theres no sense of danger the thrill is gone replaced by a careful eye on playcounts cpms and creating a brand

1002839 it will not deliver the demand that the chief medical officer made in 2003 that the early signs of unhealthy weight need to be identified
1002840 we have not banned the word obese but we have chosen not to use it
1002841 theres no point giving them a letter that doesnt have any impact on their behaviour
1002842 its clear from research weve done that parents want to know their childs results and whether there is concern about their health
1002843 but they want clear information which is helpful and non stigmatising this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight
1002844 instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives

1002866 the suggestion of increased hiv risk observed in a secondary per protocol analysis must be viewed with caution since data were censored on the basis of a post randomization factor product withdrawal that could have been confounded with group assignment
1002867 although we are disappointed that ushercell may not have a role in hiv prevention we are pleased to clarify the safety of ushercell and will pursue other avenues of development for this novel compound
1002868 the growth of our core business has become our greatest focus with newly installed equipment and substantial plant upgrades we are accepting new orders for our high quality dextran based products and negotiating a series of potential future contracts which could significantly increase our revenue stream
1002869 were on the water right now just putting on extra lines in case it comes up
1002870 its not going to be a huge issue for anybody in this area
1002871 right now we want residents in travel trailers to have a more permanent residence to go to if necessary
1002872 everything from television and radio and print and all that to organizing volunteers to go door to door
1002873 participating in every aspect of a political campaign and that includes fundraising
1002874 we want to be in a place where candidates understand that they cant ignore latinos
1002875 i got tired of waiting for someone to come out and test my water
1002876 im concerned because i dont know where its coming from
1002877 the water used to be very clear especially this time of year
1002878 there are dozens of fortune 500 companies that offer it its not a new thing
1002879 three of us said we want to do it now
1002880 fairness to the taxpayers who will pay these extra bills many of whom do not enjoy the same benefits
1002881 the company with all diligence has attempted to avoid a bankruptcy filing however the filing became necessary because of the recent failed effort to obtain financing and the recognition that the companys entire 1 8 billion of debt may soon be in default
1002882 this was confirmed when certain holders of the companys 125 million convertible notes informed the company that they rejected its exchange offer and instead insisted on being paid in cash in full on august 5 2008
1002883 the prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth
1002884 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude people ask why is there poverty in the world its a silly question poverty is the default human condition the interesting question isnt why is there poverty its why is there wealth or why is there prosperity here but not there at the end of the day the first answer is capitalism rightly understood that is to say free markets private property the spirit of entrepreneurialism and the conviction that the fruits of your labors are your own in large measure our wealth isnt the product of capitalism it is capitalism and yet we hate it leaving religion out of it no idea has given more to humanity the average working class person today is richer in real terms than the average prince or potentate of 300 years ago his food is better his life longer his health better his menu of entertainments vastly more diverse his toilette infinitely more civilized and yet we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual meanwhile billions have ridden capitalism out of poverty and yet the children of capitalism still whine
1002885 it has always been a myth that america is a classless society though that myth has its uses what begins in myth may end in reality if we pretend class doesnt matter maybe one day it wont at least as much lets just hope we never reach the point of glorifying poverty of extolling downward rather than upward mobility but romanticizing the poor has always been a staple of american discourse william henry harrison he of tippecanoe and tyler too used the log cabin as his campaign emblem and he set the fashion working class may be a term of opprobrium in some societies here it is a term of approbation at least publicly its the one class americans feel free not only to recognize but laud its hard to imagine a presidential candidate at least one with any political sense running as the candidate of the upper crust i was born in a plush penthouse on park avenue instead the lower crust is shamelessly flattered its the contemporary version of the old log cabin theme something else hasnt changed much as the andrew jacksons and william henry harrisons extolled log cabins they werent about to live in one any more than todays politicians are about to take a vow of poverty i live for the day when some politician comes out and admits that while being poor is no shame its no great honor either
1002886 as usual your essay is right on the money im consistently amazed at how you answer the very questions that are on my mind it is very reassuring to me and my friends who are now subscribers during this scary time i remind myself to worry about nothing pray about everything but the thought of obama being president makes me anxious
1002887 commenting on senator obamas suggestion that we all go out and get our cars tuned up i have a couple questions senator do you know what a tune up is have you ever been in an auto parts store if politicians are in the business of giving out good advice they may want to practice what they preach
1002888 i cannot even begin to count how many soldiers are wearing them it also has a spiritual camaraderie impact for example when you meet another christian or military member and they have the shield on their id tags it bonds you even though you may not know them
1002889 when world war ii ended the united states had the only undamaged industrial power in the world our military might was at its peak and we alone had the ultimate weapon the nuclear weapon with the unquestioned ability to deliver it anywhere in the world if we had sought world domination then who could have opposed us but the united states followed a different course one unique in all the history of mankind we used our power and wealth to rebuild the war ravished economies of the world including those of the nations who had been our enemies may i say there is absolutely no substance to charges that the united states is guilty of imperialism or attempts to impose its will on other countries by use of force
1002890 questions about the appropriate role of america in the world and how it conducts its relationships with foreign powers are of course essential topics in any presidential campaign that is particularly true at a moment when the united states finds itself engaged in a global war with a totalitarian ideology islamofascism that has embedded itself in many allied countries and enjoys strong support from most of our foes
1002891 in the first three weeks at bealls i was able to complete more than i could get done in 31 2 months at my previous job
1002892 theyve let me run with ideas its fast its great and energizing
1002893 i knew when i was going through the process of trying to convince lana to work for us that she would really thrive in this environment
1002894 in moving to a private company you can throw off the shackles that bog you down in a big public company i knew she would find that and really enjoy it
1002895 the truth is we were counting on her coming in with a fresh set of eyes and a new point of view and figuring out how to build on things we were really good at
1002896 she has made some very thoughtful critiques of certain aspects of our businesses and made some decisions about redirecting things that are in her mind a few degrees off target and building up things that are missing or underrepresented
1002897 i want to enhance our opportunities to talk to the consumer in a more effective way
1002898 weve got to get to young men and women through their phone and computers we need to talk to them in a more direct way
1002899 among the deals she has accomplished while at the chain are exclusive arrangements with chip amp pepper a red hot premium denim brand to produce a lower priced line for penneys for back to school as well as solitude a california lifestyle label shes been at the forefront of the introduction of concepts by claiborne this spring and keeps her eagle eye honed for merchandising opportunities wherever the mens division can benefit whether its big amp tall team sports or upscale jeans
1002900 weve gone from taking fashion and trend cues from europe to a world that has become one
1002901 consumers expectations are much higher they expect whats on tv to be in the store the same day
1002902 there are 1 000 details all moving at the same time
1002903 youd be surprised at how much someone like lana can observe and discern in a 30 to 60 minute walk through the store
1002904 shell call them out and youd say oh yeah i never noticed that
1002905 when she came here a number of those relationships shes developed have started to surface here
1002906 weve had relationship and used suppliers that she has used but now we will get a little bit different level of service theyll come in and walk our floors and suggest new ideas to lana just the amount of attention were getting from some very important vendors has been important and its interesting theyve occurred this quickly
1002907 we know that weve always got to stay a step ahead of the game

1002916 you couldnt keep her in shed go in the snow rain it didnt matter
1002917 we just know that that young boy is a human being and human beings make mistakes
1002918 there are stories kicking around that the reason or one of them that the highly effective hillraisers are not raising the kind of money for obama that they raised for clinton is because they have been told that no matter what they do they will never be the equal of the obama fundraisers

1002927 author ammon shea decided to make the attempt and to record his progress in this book
1002928 so he ventures out into the city reading on park benches and in public libraries no place is right finally he settles on a location in the basement of the hunter college library among books in french that dont tempt him away from the task at hand he drinks many thermosfuls of coffee he gets eyeglasses and finds much to his surprise that they help him see better his headaches continue
1002929 tell us about a time you got caught being a blowhard
1002930 a esta din mica recurrente de estar de acuerdo y hacer las mismas cosas el profesor tanaka la ha descrito como una
1002931 cabeza de del castillo fue entregada en bandeja a fujimoristas a cambio de sus votos historia secreta de los acuerdos para ganar elecci n en el congreso
1002932 la versi n que publica el diario la raz n es un nuevo globo de ensayo de los fujimoristas es una especie de derecho al pataleo del fujimorismo nadie va a aceptar una propuesta como esa menos que sea publicitada como lo ha sido la supuesta salida de jorge del castillo del gabinete aprista no creo que eso haya sido parte de la negociaci n con el gobierno lo lanzan para demostrar que los fujimoristas han pedido algo cuando en realidad lo que seguramente han solicitado es el cambio de la condici n de detenido de alberto fujimori por el de arresto domiciliario as como la cabeza del fiscal adjunto avelino guill n
1002933 tengo la mejor opini n de la sala que est conduciendo muy bien el proceso seguido al ex presidente fujimori s que cualquier hecho o movimiento pol tico que se produzca en esos niveles no va a afectar en lo m s m nimo la labor que viene desarrollando creo que es inmune a cualquier tipo de gesti n de acuerdos o pactos que se puedan dar a nivel pol tico nosotros a nivel de la fiscal a tenemos el firme convencimiento que nuestros objetivos se han alcanzado y consideramos que la sala en estos momentos ya se encuentra en un nivel de conocimiento y certeza de lo que aconteci a partir de agosto del a o 91
1002934 estamos convencidos de que nada de lo que ocurra a nivel pol tico va afectar la independencia imparcialidad e idoneidad de los integrantes de la sala penal especial ellos cuando digan por fin su palabra en noviembre probablemente de este a o van a declarar culpable a fujimori y le van a imponer la sentencia que se merece por los hechos que ha cometido
1002935 qu negoci el apra para ganar los votos fujimoristas y asegurar la victoria de javier vel squez en la elecci n para presidente del congreso mejores condiciones de carceler a para su jefe el ex presidente alberto fujimori es decir m s horas de visita mejor alimentaci n tel fono celular acceso a internet dif cil de creer poca cosa para tantos afanes fujimoristas m s a n si se consideran las pocas restricciones que tiene su jefe en la prisi n mirando el contexto no queda sino concluir que lo m s seguro es que la negociaci n de fondo tenga que ver directa o indirectamente con la sentencia contra fujimori ese es el asunto que interesa al ex presidente y a su entorno todo lo dem s est subordinado a esta preocupaci n
1002936 me parece ingenuo pensar que los fujimoristas le han dado sus votos al oficialismo solo a cambio de que los iracundos visiten a fujimori en la diroes creo que hay mucho m s que el apra ha ofrecido en este tema lo preocupante es que est usando todas las cartas que tiene en el estado que no son pocas para ayudar al fujimorismo

1002956 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
1002957 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
1002958 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
1002959 there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to iraq
1002960 law enforcement agencies or are they too busy reading ordinary peoples email and spying on antiwar organizations to bother going after a gang of dangerous poisoners and murderers

1002967 anybody buying tickets for the olympic games should be careful to buy from an official source sadly there are some fraudulent dealers known as scalpers who are out to cheat fans
1002968 our sympathy goes to them the ioc is concerned we always told people to buy tickets from the official australian supplier
1002969 so far i dont know the details we always encourage people to go through the regular ticketing channels we are against ticket sales on the black market

1002974 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
1002975 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
1002976 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
1002977 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
1002978 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
1002979 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
1002980 ive been completely left out with regard to any understanding of the progress of the investigation or what these latest developments may mean
1002981 more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
1002982 what is so striking about this is that it represents an insistence that women be held to a biological standard of womanhood consider the variations among women what does it mean to set aside some group of women and say they are too powerful to be real women
1002983 what sort of message does this send to young women other than that if you are any good you will be investigated as some sort of freak due to an assumption that women are inherently inferior to men and that only masculine characteristics allow for achievement
1002984 it was an attack on the friendship between india and afghanistan we will fight it unitedly and with determination
1002985 india has an abiding commitment to afghanistans efforts to build a democratic stable prosperous and pluralistic polity we will fulfil all our commitments to afghanistan
1002986 india has proved to be a valuable ally and is in the forefront of rebuilding afghanistan
1002987 its a tribute to indians and afghans who have died while building this road
1002988 the two countries and the world at large have no option but to fight the menace of terrorism afghanistan stands resolutely with our allies in the war against terrorism
1002989 la nica cosa que pod a hacer era mirar la televisi n y cuanto m s miraba los partidos sentado en el sill n m s triste me pon a
1002990 la informaci n que contamos nos permite se alar que en el marco de investigaciones han aparecido en algunas oportunidades algunos nexos entre uno y otro
1002991 hay lugares a los cuales ha sido m s dif cil el acceso de las polic as en algunas comunidades y en algunas oportunidades delincuentes que han participado en hechos il citos han intentado usar a las comunidades como forma de refugio
1002992 no es uno que nosotros tengamos acceso a l no ha sido puesto en conocimiento nuestro
1002993 no ser a justo tampoco estigmatizar a la comunidad pero hay un peque o grupo aislado minoritario que est realizando algunas acciones delictivas para manifestar su descontento con el sistema y obviamente para intentar afectar lo que son las condiciones de seguridad
1002994 no hemos tenido mayores avances en la determinaci n de los responsables
1002995 aqu hay gente que intenta aprovecharse de determinado tipo de situaciones y carabineros es una instituci n responsable jerarquizada disciplinada y obediente y probablemente sea gente que no se encuentre en la instituci n y corresponde evitar ese tipo de situaci n
1002996 aqu lo que hay es simplemente un c lculo pol tico
1002997 anteponer este beneficio social a cualquier tipo de c lculo pol tico
1002998 estamos todav a con un sistema que no est normalizado nos queda un terreno por avanzar importante pero s hemos salido de una crisis y se insiste en volver a tratar de reavivar esa situaci n
1002999 estuvimos bastante bien durante la semana las canchas del estadio espa ol eran demasiado r pidas ten an que prepararse antes para ejecutar los golpes terminamos los entrenamientos pero todav a falta un poco
1003000 las expectativas son mejorar el lugar que se consigui el a o pasado y evidentemente el primer objetivo grande es pasar a cuartos de final una vez ah puede pasar cualquier cosa tengo bastante fe pasando la primera etapa
1003001 hay ocho equipos fuertes pero yo dir a que son ganables no son invencibles tenemos un buen doble fernanda brito y daniela seguel jugaron 15 partidos y perdieron s lo dos
1003002 a m no me gustan esos t rminos son chicas que han hecho cosas diferentes en los ltimos 20 a os en el tenis femenino chileno generaci n dorada es cuando un grupo de gente gana muchas cosas pero ellas est n reci n empezando si ganan el mundial podr amos estar en presencia de una generaci n que comenzar a a ser algo dorado
1003003 conversamos harto nos juntamos siempre y tenemos el mismo pensamiento con respecto al objetivo del mundial que es salir campeonas
1003004 es buena la planificaci n porque nos permite tener m s tiempo para adaptarnos al clima y a la altura que van a jugar un papel importante all
1003005 tenemos muchas posibilidades y grandes resultados nos hemos medido con jugadoras de otras partes y creo que vamos a mejorar el lugar del a o pasado
1003006 preocupa la altura porque ac en chile no se puede jugar a m s de mil metros m s all de conformarnos queremos buscar el t tulo
1003007 hey do you want to express the soaring love that sunset made you feel okay first go practice e minor scales for a few days
1003008 because you want your money to take care of you
1003009 i am hoping high for this film not only is it an important film for me but also because its director vipul shahs first film as a producer and i know how much that would mean to him
1003010 we are not going to comment on whether there is a criminal investigation
1003011 the a 10c is the heaviest modernization program the a 10 has ever gone through
1003012 this is what the a 10 was meant to be 30 years ago
1003013 its an effects based upgrade to bring full integration of the targeting pod and its associated avionics its enhanced all the human factors in the close air support mission
1003014 there are three major things i care about in any cas close air support situation
1003015 friendly locations both ground and air forces target information description and location particularly the relative location to the friendly ground forces and threats the integration of the avionics in the a 10c particularly the integration of the situation awareness data link results in a significant improvement in the time it takes to perform that detailed integration required for cas
1003016 the net result is a significant reduction in the time it takes to process the kill chain
1003017 couple that with the digital stores management system and new weapons and you now have a more lethal responsive and survivable hog
1003018 it became apparent that he was being sniped at and asked us to evaluate the situation on the ground
1003019 we got the precise coordinates through the targeting pod and turned back around i sent the coordinates to the jdam via the hotas hands on throttle and stick and dropped it right in the middle of the target
1003020 i could see exactly where the friendlies were where the enemies were
1003021 it would have taken much longer to verify their location to roll in with dumb bombs in the a model the jdam made it extremely easy and precise the level of confidence in its precision was an order of magnitude more
1003022 additionally the jdams improved accuracy allows a pilot to employ it closer to friendly positions than is possible with a similar type of unguided bomb
1003023 with the targeting pod an a 10c is night and all weather
1003024 we can drop through weather without being eyes on that target location it complements what we can already do well with night vision goggles
1003025 whether its the a 10a or c the fundamentals of cas have not changed
1003026 close air support remains the same things i did in the a model i can do easier and better in the c model in this type of warfare we are one of the power players durability ruggedness and dependability the c has all that plus digitally networked avionics that provide a leap in employment efficiency and generally make it a more effective aircraft
1003027 it was an incredible sense of satisfaction to see how well the design enhanced our job
1003028 im extremely proud to have been part of a team of professionals who were able to bring the upgrade to fruition its going to save a lot of lives
1003029 a woman martyr is problematic for muslim society a man who recruits a woman is breaking islamic law
1003030 climate isnt changing in unusual ways or if it is human activities are not the cause
1003031 yes climate disruption is going to do some real damage but its too late too difficult or too costly to avoid that so well just have to hunker down and suffer
1003032 have you done your share to protest the olympics today
1003033 this woman is incredibly selfish and only thinking of herself and not how much more fun this would have been for the kids
1003034 few companies have publicly revealed how much profit they generate from paid or ad supported software but a medialets estimate would have even a relatively small developer such as pangea may have generated 1 2 million in opening weekend sales of its puzzle game enigmo
1003035 such examples arent universal only a fraction of software at the app store free or paid is likely to create that level of interest tapulous own gps aware twitter client twinkle has only produced a far more modest 80 000 downloads decrem says although it has been available for less time
1003036 look look it all mixes in without even using a spoon
1003037 notice how the male hostile holds the can just so
1003038 this positive dynamic development with regard to both the trading volumes and the trading participants shows that eex is on the right track it shows that the measures we have taken to develop natural gas trading on the exchange are bearing fruit
1003039 nymexs expansion into the steel market is a natural extension of our risk management business and we are pleased to offer a steel futures contract to serve the north american market managing price volatility has become a necessity for everyone involved along the steel supply chain and these contracts will assist the u s manufacturing industry in dealing with this issue
1003040 the nymex decision to license crus price assessments is yet a further endorsement of their accuracy and of the robustness of our research procedures
1003041 wherever steel is traded from physical transactions to futures we believe our price assessments give all participants the truest picture of the market
1003042 i know people think its mad ive planned my wedding when im single but ive not been able to help myself
1003043 im passionate about weddings i daydream about my own and its developed into a full blown plan
1003044 of course i need a groom before i get married but ill meet mr right one day in the meantime why not start preparing
1003045 i think about it when im walking to and from work and when im at the gym i talk about it with my future bridesmaids if a magazine has covered a celebrity wedding ill make a beeline for it and pore over the photos
1003046 i want a vintage style empire line gown made from ivory chantilly lace with a scooped neckline and cap sleeves
1003047 the edward berger style veil will be circular and no more than 36 inches long ill wear it with a bespoke tiara featuring an ancient greek design as my dad is greek
1003048 it would be lovely to have a special song i share with my husband to be
1003049 im not a brilliant dancer so i would consider having lessons to make sure our first dance was perfect
1003050 im flabbergasted by this whole thing this is the ultimate betrayal

1003053 one of our customers told us that their system was inundated and their internat gateway came to a halt during march madness with the basketball playoffs last year
1003054 if enough people in a building or in a certain area logged on around the same time there definitely could be some significant effect
1003055 we have thousands of servers at the edge of the last mile networks and deliver content to those servers which stream them directly to the last mile
1003056 akamai is working with the european broadcast union to deliver olympic video to the sites they support
1003057 most businesses have some online applications employees use as a critical part of the workday and thats where they could be materially affected
1003058 on top of that theres the loss of productivity when people watch these videos
1003059 you could shut access off completely but that would backfire
1003060 theyll be sending out literally millions of e mails on this system over two weeks
1003061 bad guys with spamming and phishing define e mails are always monitoring anything that will trigger a traffic spike
1003062 if you go to your favorite site say google and type in a request like olympic streaming video you may get what looks like a legitimate olympic site but isnt
1003063 youll need a policy to block streaming perhaps and antivirus layered on top of it to filter out the malware
1003064 first communicate what you mean by acceptable use in business

1003217 i choose to forget that piece of evil shit is related to me and you need to also
1003218 you live in a family of security and secrets there are not many we can keep from each other but i suggest you hightail it to chicago and put her in devons hands before king knows about her or does he already know about her
1003219 hell no king sent me a note a few weeks ago asking for help i contemplated it a while a very long while until i decided to visit chicago on other business and she knew i was there
1003220 hell i wasnt there but two seconds off the plane and she rang my phone asking me what was i doing there
1003221 i never thought about the connection we had but she talked about king and the help he needed
1003222 she would but she has a feeling lee is watching her every move and if she even looks like shes doing work for her brother lethal might blow her head off because of association she had that look and i caved in to drop in to see what king wanted
1003223 which is why i thought i should keep it to myself
1003224 he needs help finding someone thats in detroit that doesnt want to be found
1003225 you know those debts arent anything but the devil paybacks why are you involving yourself on this you could go to jail and he wont even care
1003226 it doesnt matter and hes still got that jones made her father sign her over like some slave trade agreement for a casino debt that couldnt possibly be paid back ever but she ran away before she was collected i cant imagine how her lifes been or even if shes still the same sweet self but she obviously ran to the one person who could make sure she was hidden from king
1003227 you think all this time lethal was keeping her hidden
1003228 but he doesnt know about that i mean everyone thinks i was you know but king had it bad for her
1003229 and she couldnt have been anything but five when it started so now hes just damn pissed and wanting something he cant have i tried to talk him out of it but hes determined and if i wont help him hell find other means especially now that he knows where she is
1003230 so youre going to deliver her on a silver platter to him
1003231 im going to do the best that i can to find her and then see what i can do to resolve this whole damn mess
1003232 lethals already mad at you going behind his back is going to piss him off
1003233 king knows exactly how he can find her he knows where she hides out and even where her sister is which i dont even think she knows either because that crazy bit and he would come himself but you know lethals got tabs on him if i dont do this hell come red and then well have the blood bath of the century i dont think any of this is ever going to be resolved between the two of them unless some miracle pops off but if this is going to keep king out of detroit since hes my brother i do have a small obligation to him
1003234 lethals a little to blame over this shit too if he wasnt so dead set bent on work he probably would have been home and could have helped me red so dont think that mans got heaven seeping out his ass lethals got some bones in his closet and hes just pissed that king didnt heed the warning and he wasnt there to stop everything all in all we all got some guilt about the past and maybe i have some issues i havent faced yet but dammit i refuse to sit here and say lethal can sit on his podium and preach down to me
1003235 just promise youll deliver her to devon before he dies or lethal have two reasons to kick your ass by the way whyd you go to chicago
1003236 the bitch whos a journalist now right what about her
1003237 and to think that i saw it on mulberry street
1003238 i recalled the days of living in the dorms in college where i was as comfortable in my
1003239 the cost of the punishment is of no import what is paramount is that swift even handed justice be meted out
1003240 this is the best carrot i have ever grown and i want to give it to you to show you how much i appreciate being in your kingdom
1003241 you expected me to give you something because you gave me your best horse but i cant do that because you didnt give me the horse you gave yourself the horse
1003242 je lai et je ne peux que vous ordonner de vous la procurer
1003243 i dont know what that woman has done to you reese but you are worthy of everything this world has to offer you and dammit this isnt just your fight anymore
1003244 i care about you i want to help you i want to make you happy
1003245 because youre emperor heart you too sexy too wonderful too handsome to want to have me as a wife
1003246 because when i marry i want it to be forever this is just a temporary solution to a current problem
1003247 and who says i dont want it to be forever
1003248 can you lone me a little color so i can look better
1003249 em asked me to pick it out something for you when he asked red and i to meet you in the alley behind your house
1003250 its my dress and im about a size smaller than you but ive lost weight since marrying red and if we have to take it out reds a genius with a needle although hes sewn more skin than fabric do you like it
1003251 how can i get married so fast i thought i needed 72 hours
1003252 yes all it takes is to find someone who can do it this late at night now go freshen up red and em have gone to get the master of ceremonies and the paper work ill do your hair when youre out of the shower
1003253 my purse how am i to get married without my purse
1003254 red said he towed your mothers car and saw it was left inside he did peruse it and saw that it was yours
1003255 thats probably why em asked me to come along and bring some extra stuff hed already accessed your size and just found a woman he knew with almost the same proportions onyxs a little smaller and treasures chest sticks out too much and her waist is too wide
1003256 yes this is the first any hearts been married with emperor getting married this might turn the tide in the family because none of them will ever believe that em got married hes the last one anyone would suspect that a woman could tie him down
1003257 to be honest any woman who marries a heart should know that it doesnt matter if you wear white or not everyone knows that a heart wouldnt marry anyone without tasting the goods first
1003258 youre very beautiful and look much more mature with make up on i can see what he sees now
1003259 red was worried that you looked way too young ems women are usually more mature looking worn if you ask me but you have this fresh faced look about you youre different from any woman ive known em to have
1003260 thats supposed to mean something good for me i dont understand
1003261 you know all women who love heart men are insane so dont try to understand the crazy feelings you get when you feel the way you do about him
1003262 yes im insane too because i do love that man too much
1003263 red likes to go around though and have people refer me like his wife because i wouldnt accept his marriage proposal until three days ago i guess i finally got it through my thick skull that this man wanted to be with me forever
1003264 steven had asked emperor to be his best man at this even and to bring a date to witness the occasion yesterday
1003265 early this afternoon emperor calls red and says that hes doing the same thing to a wonderful woman and that he hasnt lost his damn mind
1003266 yes it was quite sudden did he say where he was when he made this decision or do you remember
1003267 i dont know your feelings for him or even why emperors doing this but he must care a great deal about you to even take this step if neither of you have spoken about love but you care as much as him theres something between the two of you that could lead to love
1003268 my familys dead except for a brother and hes in government protection right now until some things pass over
1003269 its not your fault stevens father wasnt very well accepted to the crimes he committed against children but hes dead too now and the hearts are slowly accepting of him into the family after some past issues
1003270 well in detroit theres emperor sheriff and prince you could say their on the good side of the family king queen and blaque stay in chicago and ive only seen queen but ive never met her she isnt a very nice person according everyone we know the other two wont come to detroit at all

1003346 generally subprime lending and the foreclosure crisis is presented as if it is only an issue for minority and low income borrowers
1003347 however the data shows that the problem is much broader than just with minorities and low income households my belief is if we widen our lenses to see that this problem affects all segments of society we will change the tone and context of our approach to solutions

1003365 has he personally told you he wants to hurt you
1003366 devon mcguire dont have to say much to get his point across
1003367 did he say it to your face that he was upset with you or did he send word he was going to kill you
1003368 nothing like that sir but his sister told me that i better high tail it out of his face
1003369 i dont need to be told twice that my lifes in danger and anyone knows once you get on devons bad side you stay there till you die
1003370 i just figured i didnt need to hear that im gonna die from the horses mouth in order for me to go into hiding
1003371 is there anything you can remember about when your mother was alive that had to do with any money leah
1003372 things for me while growing up was kinda splotchy being high most of the time or trying to get the next one was terrible
1003373 sometimes you gotta lie about the life youre living in order to make it to the next day mister my life and all the drugs back then had me nothing else
1003374 im not judging leah but i really have to know
1003375 this pimp on the street took a real liking to me he was a drug pusher too that kept me supplied as long as i kept my legs open freddie treated me like a queen but i was only fourteen he introduced all the heavy stuff to me and the more i stayed the more babies i had he got shot to death in the car right next to me and i knew i didnt have no means of raising babies at seventeen so i just leftem in the car and made people think i was gone too
1003376 it was three a boy named after freddie and then there was faith and skye fraternal twins i had two more after that but they died on the streets and then came devons child
1003377 like i said i put that behind me just like i put reese behind me if she knew the truth about her mother she wouldnt want to live another day knowing she had my blood running through her
1003378 i heard this mcguire and nita arguing once usually they whispered a lot whenever nita showed up i was supposed to hide in the upper back room which could only be assessed through the nurserys closet but in that room i could hear all conversations that went on throughout the house
1003379 nita came to pick up reese that day early she said something about putting reese in school and needing a birth certificate she asked my mother where could she get a fake one i remember her saying she needed a real good one cause it would have to get through the government for reeses number my mother told her about someone named costello who knew how to make the stuff that the government cant tell the difference and i can vouch for that cause costellos given me some stuff that i could leave the country with and no one would ever know
1003380 as far as i know but it may not be the same one they pass their shit down and been around way before i was born but one is just like the other the youngest is now called shadow i know her mother is from chicago and she came in search of her daddy here in detroit when she was just eight years old when that didnt pan out she just stayed and was taught the trade
1003381 bout eighteen now but what does this have to do with anything
1003382 ill probably need to speak with her to see if she can remember if nita ever came to her or her people and verify what this nita may look like
1003383 why ask shadow i already asked her and yes nita did
1003384 what games are you playing with us leah if you know something that we should know to then why arent you saying
1003385 cause what i think dont count anymore and i cant fight it even if what i think is true

1003390 we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1003391 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1003392 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
1003393 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1003394 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1003395 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
1003396 the telephone was full of photos and videos he grinned as he chopped off her limbs the photos also include ones like those of the taliban in which the decapitated head is replaced atop the body
1003397 near the walls where you cant get the nail gun in the strips are glued as each strip goes in it is tapped with a block to make it tight when meeting other flooring a reducer or transition strip is a good way to make the entryway smooth

1003399 doctors will write anything their patient asks them to write

1003403 if the lord is with us why has all this happened to us where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said did not the lord bring us up out of egypt but now the lord has abandoned us and put us into the hand of midian
1003404 why god lets us suffer even when we are sure that we are not doing anything wrong
1003405 we have found the one moses wrote about in the law 24 27 then beginning with moses and all the prophets he interpreted to them the things written about himself in all the scriptures

1003416 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1003417 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1003418 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1003419 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1003420 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1003421 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1003422 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

1003434 the new zealand hierachy expressed its concerns at the weekend and we feel the same way oneill said
1003435 its enormously disappointing we thoroughly support the new zealand stance and their comments suggest they are prepared to lead the way on this issue
1003436 we will discuss it again at sanzar level and no doubt will be speaking to the countries involved there comes a time when you have to demand promises are kept
1003437 that would allow them a full compliment of players for june tours to the southern hemisphere once again however that may not be the case oneill said
1003438 it is a possibility hobbs declared it was unacceptable france would send out a weakened touring party
1003439 that is a matter we will be taking further hobbs said
1003440 we are unhappy with it and we will be speaking both with the irb and the french with respect to it as will the australians
1003441 we will keep all of our options open at the moment he said
1003442 redeem team by a hawkish us media but the pressures are starting to show with the american press latching on to and dissecting every utterance by the players
1003443 guarantee the us would win gold he answered in the affirmative
1003444 we dont have any choice but to win the gold after what happened in athens barely registered for days us news bulletins were full of the story particularly when james refused to back down
1003445 we cant guarantee just winning pool play weve got to guarantee winning the whole thing thats not me being overconfident or saying anything against our opponents our goal is to guarantee the gold medal thats how everybody should look at it
1003446 i see it as a real positive for our playing group and our club to have somebody of bens standard as a footballer to set an example on the training track and its great for our young players coming through eastaugh said
1003447 ben really wants to be a part of the playing group he really wants to get back into the club environment and wants to see where hes at from a footballing perspective from meetings with ben ive been really impressed by what he wanted to do and what he wanted to achieve by being with us
1003448 it feels normal when asked what it felt like to be back
1003449 you see the condition hes in currently hes well and truly preparing himself eastaugh said
1003450 hes an absolute professional and he was always classified as one of the best trainers at west coast and its the kind of workmanlike mentality he has that will set him up well and truly for next year
1003451 didier will not play in our first game against portsmouth and will probably miss the second against wigan if there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that said scolari
1003452 but when you have a knee injury you just never know said the brazilian
1003453 i have been getting a progress report from the doctor every day hes getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the training ground i hope he will be ready to start training next week but he will not play until he is in good condition
1003454 incidents like we saw with hally last week probably happen 10 times a game the coach said
1003455 it is getting a little bit tedious a little bit boring a little bit offensive in some ways at the moment i think this barry hall fixation by the people in the media is becoming unpleasant
1003456 there are a lot of players getting away with a lot worse things than what barry hall did on the weekend you look at it footage of the incident and it is laughable it is farcical
1003457 just treat him like every other player thats how we think he should be treated roos said
1003458 if he does something wrong as he has clearly a couple of times this year we expect him to be penalised for those incidents and we as a club will penalise him for those incidents as you have seen this was a reasonably simple incident
1003459 i thought he was one of our better players roos said of hall
1003460 once we started getting the ball in there he kicked three goals and he could have finished with five or six
1003461 vaughan is crucial for england to regain the ashes next year because he is such a good captain warne said
1003462 my biggest worry with pietersen is that he gets a bit far above himself and doesnt keep his feet on the ground hes got to remember who his friends are if he keeps that in mind he will be all right he has as much talent as anyone that has ever played the game

1003472 williams will be in toulon on monday or tuesday he said

1003480 every region fell short of our forecast but the majority of the disappointment relative to our earnings per share forecast came from north america a 4 4 billion loss versus our forecast loss of 2 2 billion and gmac a loss of 1 2 billion vs our forecast loss of 100 million
1003481 gm has dug itself a very deep hole from which it will be difficult to fully extricate itself
1003482 even assuming an about 2 million unit rebound in u s industry demand and significant help from the 2007 uaw agreement we still think gm north america will lose money

1003500 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
1003501 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
1003502 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
1003503 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
1003504 youd think the industry would have learned something from the success of so many free press authors and the closing of the american mind
1003505 but no they resisted trying to seriously get into this market for another 15 years
1003506 been taking on fewer books and become a lot more selective this year well publish only five or six including mike huckabees book down from ten a few years ago we want to keep the imprint as robust as possible but the way to do that is not simply to keep our output up and pretend the market is what it was three years ago
1003507 the lesson weve learned or actually relearned is that there are no hard and fast rules in this business aside from the fact youve got to be smart creative and persistent
1003508 theres a conservative market out there and its not going away
1003509 it became an anthropological question for them who are these people there followed a whole cottage industry of books and articles trying to prove that conservatives are a product of bad parenting psychological syndromes or genetic defects as well as generally stupid and evil
1003510 and report so and so passed then read me the note from the editor it would say things like this is well written but the premise doesnt make any sense liberal bias whats
1003511 a conservative publisher i felt a little funny about that
1003512 this idea that a regnery book is somehow illegitimate is just incredible bs why is it that were supposed to be concerned about regnery being a conservative house but nobody worries about all the publishers in manhattan being liberal houses it scares me even thinking about what wouldve happened if id gone with one of those houses the book wouldve come and gone in a minute and sold exactly no copies
1003513 they initially printed only 13 000 copies and as far as i know gave it no advertising
1003514 amazon sold out the third day and we got hundreds of e mails from all over the country from people that couldnt find it in the stores which just killed it commercially the truth is the house just never seemed very excited about the book
1003515 but jonah was an internet star and in the first week the demand from his troops was so intense that it jumped onto the times s list with 12 000 copies in print even then doubleday just eked the book out into the marketplace reprinting in quantities of 5 000 or 10 000 if this had been a book by a major liberal journalist they would have gone out with 30 000 copies and reprinted in increments of 20 000 and we would have been up to 150 000 in no time with huge stacks in barnes and noble even when jonahs book hit number one it still wasnt easily obtainable youd walk into a barnes and noble and if they had it at all it would be tucked away on the second floor in the back in the sociology section eventually they pushed the book up to 198 000 copies i would like to have seen 300 000 in print
1003516 everybody reads the new york times every day and takes it as orthodoxy signing books on that basis it was evident very quickly how insular the whole system is they could all name three four five chefs but couldnt name a single clergyman
1003517 im sitting there in my office and a young editorial assistant walks in
1003518 all i can say is im very sorry for your loss which is what you say at a funeral right
1003519 each of these companies has its own ann coulter pat buchanan or bill oreilly
1003520 too many people even in the industry buy into the caricature that conservative publishing is all about polemics weve published memoirs like bob novaks the prince of darkness and michael medveds right turns serious works of history investigative journalists like bill gertz and ken timmerman not to mention the george wills and michael barones of the world
1003521 reasoned thoughtful and made an enormous contribution to the debate in the public arena
1003522 if we could have had a generalized debate in the culture if cnn had been willing to cover the subject the way fox did the impact could have been so much greater
1003523 fox was all over this like a cheap suit but fox is behind a firewall
1003524 you have to prepare them for whats going to going to get the bad review in pw followed by the indignant column by paul krugman but you have to let them know that in this case bad is good we need our enemies we cherish them we use the new york times to energize conservative media i send every book i publish to times columnist frank rich with a nice note saying i hope you hate this one unfortunately theyve gotten a little more savvy about being used that way and tend not to respond thats why i miss anthony lewis he could never restrain himself
1003525 oprah is not one of the places we go for our books
1003526 the approach has paid off though regnery produces only 20 to 25 titles annually of the 72 conservative books that have been on the
1003527 my own feeling is that these imprints are designed to fail
1003528 management would be happy to see them succeed for financial reasons yet because they basically see this type of publishing as deeply distasteful an alien organism within the publishing body theyd be just as happy if they fail then they could say see we tried this kind of publishing is not a good business and move on
1003529 the large publishing houses have always held their noses when it comes to conservative imprints
1003530 my guess is that if they survive at all theyll transition from conservative politics to just politics and current events
1003531 the truth is theres never been real commitment to the ideas in those books or for that matter to genuine intellectual pluralism once its clear the winds shifted and theyre less profitable its a good bet theyll be gone
1003532 mainstream publishers to stop seeing conservatives as a market to be ghettoized and exploited but as a vital part of the american tapestry but
1003533 i also think conservatives are also going to have to adjust get smarter argue better and write more with an intention to persuade rather than just mock belittle and demonize
1003534 there will be room for a lot of different voices
1003535 the problem for contemporary liberals is that they really dont understand it applies to them
1003536 weve turned our western lands into swiss cheese and gasoline is at 4 25
1003537 if we want lower gas prices anytime soon we need a serious commitment to conservation and renewable energy not more land and outer continental shelf giveaways to oil and gas companies

1003544 ole was a fantastic player with whom i loved to play not even for the way he plays but also for the person he really is as a person he is absolutely fantastic spectacular kind and very very nice i improved a lot just because ive played side by side with him he taught me lots of things i also grew up with him and for that i have to say thank you ole
1003545 ill never forget when he came on as a sub at forest and within 10 minutes had scored four goals
1003546 fergie thinks solskjaer will be the best of the lot
1003547 i remember seeing him walk into the dressing room and thinking how young he looked he had such a baby face
1003548 as soon as he started training you could see that he had what it took to become a manchester united player a great manchester united player in fact he was one of those players that whenever he got the ball he did something with it
1003549 you only reach the first team of manchester united with the hard work and willpower of steel
1003550 ole gunnar solskjaer our man was doing his warm up up and down old traffords grass and old trafford started to sing stretford end at first then north stand and then the whole stadium you are my solskjaer my ole solskjaer you make me happy when skies are grey it was so fantastically loud the choir of old trafford was at its heights
1003551 i remember sticking my foot out and the ball going in but everything else is a bit of a blur
1003552 ole has admitted he had a limited talent he is more a product of endless and honest work
1003553 i asked him what he felt when old trafford sang his song even at times when he was injured i feel proud but a bit embarrassed as well he answered i think to myself why me a little man from kristiansund a legend at old trafford
1003554 i worked for the best manager of all time i played with the best players in the world and in front of the best fans i am very proud of what i achieved but very humble as well that i was given the opportunity to do that

1003559 we have not and we will not reduce our cover prices
1003560 that the misfortunes that are beginning to envelop us lie at the door of politicians and world leaders that are either financially or morally corrupt or just plain stupid would be hard to deny as the crises looms our earnest hope is that a political figure of stature that is honorable and intelligent and capable of appreciating global implications instead of being insular in outlook will emerge to lead the world by example

1003563 part of my fascination was due to the fact that i had relatively zero knowledge about the adult film industry
1003564 prior to watching the movie and like many other mainstream people i had preconceived notions about the industry and the people in it
1003565 according to our research and the people weve spoken with john holmes was a chameleon he had the ability to be whatever people wanted him to be at any given time
1003566 he could be very crafty and he was street smart but he was also bright funny and as most people know he had the ability to fabricate and tell entertaining stories that would go beyond the realm of believability
1003567 he enjoyed seeing how far he could push the boundaries which is probably one of the reasons he told outlandish tales
1003568 more importantly he was smart in the sense that he knew how to sell his product and the lies he told were actually a great marketing tool as they served to perpetuate his legend

1003570 a year ago the conventional wisdom was yep there are problems out there but theres still significant value

1003584 faymanns vorschlag wonach 25 prozent plus eine aktie in sterreichischem besitz verbleiben sollen ist volkswirtschaftlich vertretbar und richtig die voestalpine und b hler sind beste beispiele daf r dass das gut funktionieren kann und nur so k nnten auch l ngerfristig die interessen der besch ftigten und des unternehmens gewahrt werden
1003585 der zug ist nach zweij hriger vorbereitungsphase bereits abgefahren kurios ist dass frau stenzel die ganze zeit in die planung ber die neugestaltung mit eingebunden gewesen ist und dabei kein wort ber einen nderungswunsch bez glich der beleuchtung verloren hat jetzt nachdem der auftrag bereits erteilt worden ist eine komplette nderung zu fordern ist mehr als eine unverst ndliche vorgangsweise
1003586 die sp innere stadt kann deshalb dem vorsto der bezirksvorsteherin nichts abgewinnen
1003587 die glanzstoff totengr ber stadler und leitner spielen mit dem schicksal von tausenden betroffenen bis jetzt hat der st p ltner b rgermeister alles daran gesetzt um dem traditionsreichen standort den todessto zu versetzen und somit 327 mitarbeiter deren familien sowie rund tausend mitarbeitern in den zulieferfirmen in gr te bedr ngnis zu bringen nachdem er das geschafft hat markiert er jetzt viel zu sp t und v llig unglaubw rdig den angeblichen helfer diese scheinheiligkeit auf dem r cken der menschen stinkt zum himmel
1003588 faktum ist dass stadler leitner heinzl amp co den betrieb aus st p lten vertrieben haben einerseits hat sich der b rgermeister viel zu wenig um das verfahren gek mmert um den betrieb wieder flott zu bekommen andererseits haben leitner amp co das glanzstoffwerk und damit tausende menschen in einer sp regierten stadt v llig im stich gelassen das zeigt einmal mehr dass sich die landes sp von der arbeitsmarktpolitik endg ltig abgemeldet hat

1003590 dass die wiener liste vom sp spitzenkandidaten werner faymann angef hrt wird erf llt uns nat rlich mit stolz als wiener wohnbaustadtrat hat er schon bewiesen wie man politik f r die menschen macht wenn er nun f r ganz sterreich antritt umso besser

1003597 akamai is working with the european broadcast union to deliver olympic video to the sites they support
1003598 most businesses have some online applications employees use as a critical part of the workday and thats where they could be materially affected

1003608 the second day of july 1776 will be the most memorable epocha in the history of america i am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival it ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to god almighty it ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade with shews games sports guns bells bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more you will think me transported with enthusiasm but i am not i am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure that it will cost us to maintain this declaration and support and defend these states yet through all the gloom i can see the rays of ravishing light and glory i can see that the end is more than worth all the means and that posterity will tryumph in that days transaction even altho we should rue it which i trust in god we shall not
1003609 there are also some important human health benefits related to components of grass finished beef
1003610 while there is no difference in the cholesterol content of grass and grain finished beef and the limited amount of conjugated linoleic acid in cooked steaks is too small to do much for human health there is still an advantage in the increased omega 3 fat content in grass fed beef
1003611 the results of the study showed that most consumer evaluations of the cooked meat were not influenced by frame sizes of the cattle weight at harvest range of grazing period from 120 180 days and final fat composition of the carcass
1003612 however all of the cattle must have plenty of high quality forage to consume daily plus be harvested at 18 months of age or less none of the production practices or consumer values studied were related to the final fatty acid profiles or cholesterol content of the steaks
1003613 not surprisingly we found finishing productive healthy cattle on good pastures and stored forages for at least 120 days is far more important to consumer acceptance of the product than cattles frame size or how fat the animals are

1003617 community recreation and parks is the health provider that you dont know about
1003618 traditionally these agencies are considered as organizers of games and sports in a towns parks or ball fields but our study shows that 9 out of 10 recreation and park professionals are actively involved in a health partnership sometimes several of them
1003619 twenty years ago health care providers didnt consider recreation and park professionals to be a partner in the campaigns to promote health but in the 1990s community based health partnerships were starting to consider the role of recreation and parks in promoting physical activity and quality of life since many related programs are offered by recreation and park managers
1003620 health campaigns naturally involve recreation and park departments because they provide low cost close to home opportunities for physical activity such as trails recreation centers outdoor courts and outdoor swimming facilities
1003621 parks trails and recreation centers can also serve as settings for physical rehabilitation
1003622 having facilities is critical but then programs also have to be established to bring in residents and encourage them to take part
1003623 partnerships that include after school programs diet and nutritional information and policy efforts to promote recreational settings should be encouraged
1003624 the study was designed to provide baseline information on the state of current health partnership practices within the profession their successes and their challenges
1003625 such information can be used to help a community effectively develop a program in health and physical activity promotion

1003635 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
1003636 we must get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub
1003637 the history of financial involvement in increasing home ownership is one of taking risks of designing new financial instruments and financial products to make financial resources available so that more people can realize the goal of home ownership taking prudent risks in lending so that others may attain an objective is the essential role of a financial intermediary

1003667 alexander isayevich solzhenitsyn the most famous russian writer and historian of our age has died at eighty nine years of age
1003668 i replied that i was unable to receive an award from a government that had led russia into such dire straits
1003669 that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life countries are judged on the merit of their progress in this direction however it is a conception which developed out of western incomprehension of the essence of other worlds out of the mistake of measuring them all with a western yardstick the real picture of our planets development is quite different
1003670 the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days
1003671 to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about

1003676 if structures are put in place as they have been designed then there should be no net increase in the amount of water runoff than there is now
1003677 in my opinion drainage structures when used correctly can help with flooding issues
1003678 the trucks would travel on an access road designed specifically for that purpose and would not travel through chattaroy

1003779 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
1003780 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1003781 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well

1003801 we expect apple to launch new models of the iphone at lower price points in calendar year 2009
1003802 this rumour still doesnt make any sense to me for this year
1003803 taking features out of the current iphone loses 10 or more of revenue for every 1 saved in build costs iphone nano would have to outsell iphone by a large factor 5 10 times the sales to make sense

1003826 i am pleased to have been nominated by the president of the united states
1003827 out of respect for the process i cannot further comment
1003828 a lot of these people are from the underbelly of new york
1003829 most of us dont know them and dont know what their lives are like we almost never hear their stories now that im paying attention to that the courthouse has become a much richer experience
1003830 the obvious explanation is that bastians termination had nothing to do with funding and everything to do with his unprofessional behavior and failure to abide by applicable rules and regulations
1003831 he also conceded in contravention of school policy he had approached at least two teachers and suggested that they alter student athletes grades to preserve their eligibility for competition
1003832 now that we have this ruling it gives us something to stand on
1003833 that time and resources have been wasted is indisputable and the court attributes this to the actions of both parties as well as the court itself
1003834 but this is no reason to stay the course an opportunity for extrication has presented itself and it is in the interest of all parties that the opportunity not be squandered
1003835 it is likely that oddly it was just a coincidence
1003836 but the fact is the name global one which they are trying to protect in the telephone field of commerce they were using it just after i started using it in my field of commerce which is insurance

1003842 judge bucaria did recuse himself from the case i dont have any knowledge as to why
1003843 the amish desire not to conform to this world must be reasonably and rationally tempered with required compliance to regulations imposed by a town and society in which they are citizens
1003844 we anticipate that the judges sentencing decision together with the changes we have made to our referee operations staff will enable us to continue with the improvements we are making to our anti gambling rules policies and procedures
1003845 this being the case the claim may not now be re litigated by plaintiffs the appeals panel declared
1003846 new york state has the most archaic and bizarrely convoluted court structure in the country
1003847 acting supreme court justices are appointed based on workload and the operational needs of the court legal scholarship seniority and other qualifications are also taken into account
1003848 part 121 of the administrative rules is quite clear on how the decision making process is conducted and the rule speaks for itself
1003849 hours the number of days you work if someone has a reputation for abusing staff that would come up
1003850 people who are going to be chosen as actings now generally the review is do they work hard are there any temperament problems if someone has bad work habits were not going to make them an acting
1003851 we keep productivity statistics just like every other system and those are the points that are debated
1003852 we obviously look at the persons scholarship and temperament but lets say you have six judges and theyre all pretty much equal
1003853 if somebodys been reversed 500 times by the appellate terms then you dont want them because they dont know the law
1003854 then we might go outside the seniority aspect of it
1003855 will probably go out into the legal community and find out who would be best with that
1003856 she looks for a judge who has that kind of social worker background or mentality
1003857 the qualities i look for would be temperament good work ethic feedback if i manage to get that from the bar someone who takes on complicated cases what is that judges ability to navigate the shoals and so forth
1003858 ill say well that person has more than average absenteeism when assignments are made that person complained
1003859 are few and far between i have some wonderful judges here
1003860 a good thing that theyre looking at what their track record is
1003861 the impact of rape or sexual abuse can be devastating and often people affected become depressed experience family breakdown require medication lose their jobs self esteem and or lack confidence
1003862 this group is crucial to the on going provision of first class sexual violence support services in the region
1003863 we have believed from day one that transfer provides a great opportunity for tenants to secure major investment in their homes and housing services
1003864 we are delighted that tenants have voted in favour of the transfer
1003865 the next few months will be spent preparing to ensure everything is in place for when the transfer takes place next year
1003866 entire strategy seems to have been to coast on the work of others
1003867 azraels strategy made little contribution to the progress of the cases before me
1003868 now an affront to the hard work that others contributed

1003872 there is not a day that transpires that i dont think about this case
1003873 this case is profoundly upsetting to me because i gave you every chance i could if i give you another chance you will deal drugs i know i am hurting you i know i am hurting your parents i know i am hurting every person who comes before me in your position asking for leniency
1003874 appeal is being seriously considered our concern is that the underlying facts and truth about the use of fictitious organizations will not be revealed and there will be very little accountability on the part of the elected and appointed officials who carried out the scheme
1003875 im quite optimistic that the new rule makes a dramatic difference
1003876 now that the new rule has been called to the judges attention it would be very difficult for him not to give it significant weight
1003877 a matter of law not just a matter of principle
1003878 in this case the essence of the defendants crimes involve harboring illegal aliens and forcing them to perform domestic labor in addition the jury determined that varsha actually caused serious bodily injury to the victims
1003879 as such the court finds that the defendants fit into the class of persons for whom the statutes were designed
1003880 delphi will be able to move forward with legal proceedings against the plan investors with exceptions specified by the court
1003881 foreign relations generally and specifically during a time of war are not black and white and the pmoi need not be viewed as a monolithic entity
1003882 it is perfectly permissible for the military to forge alliances with those in the pmoi with whom it wants to deal while the government deters through prosecution other individuals particularly united states citizens from rendering material support to the organization on their own
1003883 the appointment which isnt subject to state senate confirmation raises doubts about the governors judgment
1003884 during that quarter century presiding over shelter litigation the irrepressibly activist freedman made three things quite plain from the bench new york must supply immediate housing to anyone who asks for it said housing had better meet her exacting expensive standards if city hall objects city hall can go to hell
1003885 azraels entire strategy seems to have been to coast on the work of others and to wait for last position before entering into any meaningful settlement discussions with respect to his clients
1003886 these may be lean and hard fiscal times but my 30 years in various roles in the judicial branch taught me there are smart ways to work through road bumps and the cost is measured in more than dollars its paid every day by poor people incarcerated because of their inability to gain even temporary freedom so as to mount an effective defense to charges against them a system of meet em greet em and plead em a description from louisiana thats also applicable to new york where overworked defense attorneys actually dont even meet clients before disposition hearings is a recipe for wrongful convictions and a pervasive lessening of respect for the rule of law
1003887 i conclude that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment grants a convicted offender access to physical evidence for the purpose of dna testing if it can be performed with negligible cost to the state and exculpatory results would undermine confidence in the outcome of trial
1003888 ive said this all along had law enforcement done an investigation 20 years ago i would not have spent 6 338 days in prison
1003889 i hope that at some point the actual killers are prosecuted but whether that happens or not i hope the justice system learns a lesson from what went wrong in this case so there wont be as many marty tankleffs in the future

1003898 there are thousands of threats that are made that you dont hear about because we dont want copy cats
1003899 judges get threatened every day its a common things that people threaten you
1003900 somebody goes and tells their lawyer im going to kick that judges ass the lawyer tells the judge a lot of stuff like that the judges just ignore
1003901 i dont believe ive ever had a threat leveled against myself or if i did i didnt recognize it
1003902 i dont feel that way but i understand its a legitimate concern i just dont have any personal experience of that kind
1003903 we are the ones who have to look people in the eyes and say youre losing your home you can have a divorce you cant have a divorce
1003904 the matrimonial part is the most difficult part defendants in a criminal case dont go after the judge they go after the district attorney
1003905 we respect the security concern judge gerges raised it to me
1003906 but of course weve been given about five different reasons in the past years as to why that lot is necessary in various orders this is just the most recent one so we sort of take this with a grain of salt
1003907 situating judges parking to provide direct access to the judges entrance to the courthouse
1003908 if car parking provisions are possible judges parking should be so planned as to provide adequate security and direct access to the judges entrance of the courthouse
1003909 with the sizeable contingent of judges at this facility the potentially volatile proceedings they preside over and contraband issues there is reasonable justification for protection outside the facility
1003910 its not the walk its what happens when they leave the court at 6 00 at night
1003911 this obviously is has been and always was a security issue for the judges
1003912 judges not only plop their cars but they have armed guards officers police patrolling the lot so pedestrians are relegated to a skinny little sidewalk
1003913 they claim the need for security i dont know if they need such security when some of them walk to work or take the subway and go out to lunch on montague street in a flock
1003914 its like anything if youre looking for someone heres your opportunity to get them
1003915 and do you know what the ironic part is i named the park
1003916 this all goes back to when the el was there and it was just a hodgepodge
1003917 s o the public understands what the courthouse is about
1003918 im using my skills as a city councilman and its really making people feel good
1003919 it is a magnet for parking abuse once you give someone that parking entitlement it tends to erode their appreciation for public space
1003920 were not strangers to what the courts do we just dont want their cars in our parks
1003921 its hardly up to the administrative judge to weigh in except to speak up in the interest of the judges
1003922 ive seen judges in both terms who were the subject of individual threats
1003923 i never felt ill at ease or unsafe whether its a safety issue in some boroughs and it may be or whether its a convenience issue judges have always had accommodations
1003924 why doesnt the city come in here with the police department and do an analysis from a security point of view not a judge point of view or a parks points of view and tell us that were wrong
1003925 it is the policy of the rudin management company to not discuss individual residential tenants
1003926 lew and jack rudin over many years have had many friends in and out of government
1003927 from time to time some of the people would tell the rudins look we really would like and need an apartment
1003928 he didnt want to hear it he wanted to hear that i was a rogue
1003929 at some point we just lost confidence that mr teitelbaum was being objective
1003930 after that my lawyer sought a direct dialogue with the commissioners but theyve refused to engage they wont even listen to our concerns
1003931 ik heb een horde en alliance character op maximum level
1003932 we hebben gezegd dat het dit jaar uit gaat komen en ik kan je vertellen dat het spel niet zal verschijnen in het derde kwartaal
1003933 there is only one success to be able to spend your life in your own way
1003934 plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work
1003935 we dont see things as they are we see them as we are
1003936 giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys
1003937 time is what we want most but what we use worst
1003938 he who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
1003939 in una societ dove tutto proibito si pu fare tutto in una societ dove permesso qualcosa si pu fare solo quel qualcosa

1003976 intendi non sai quanto mi piacerebbe ucciderti ma sono felice che lei stia al caldo vero
1003977 certo che s non hai la minima idea di quanto mi piacerebbe poter fare ci che stai facendo per lei randagio
1003978 temo che sia troppo tardi jake come facciamo a essere amici se ci amiamo cos
1003979 no io sono perfetto per te bella non avremmo dovuto sforzarci mai sarebbe stato immediato facile come respirare mi avresti naturalmente trovato nel cammino della tua vita se il mondo fosse come dovrebbe se non ci fossero n mostri n magia
1003980 e come una droga per te bella ormai ho capito che senza di lui non puoi vivere e troppo tardi ma io sarei stato una scelta pi sana non una droga io sarei stato laria il sole

1003986 era un pensiero infantile ma mi piaceva lidea che fossero le sue labbra lultima bella cosa che avrei sentito un altro enorme motivo di disagio che non avrei mai ammesso di fronte ad altri era che volevo essere contagiata dal suo veleno cos gli sarei appartenuta in un modo tangibile reale

1004031 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
1004032 they will talk about it in their own time at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy but if things keep progressing between them they wont have a problem discussing it further down the track
1004033 if they had been concieved through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it but

1004066 in de jaren zeventig had hij een kolossaal publiek maar de boeken die hij daarna schreef zijn nauwelijks nog gelezen zeker niet buiten rusland hij was zozeer verbonden met de strijd tegen het communisme dat hij deel is gaan uitmaken van dat tijdperk het wordt afwachten of zijn werk de tand des tijds doorstaat
1004067 deze zomer heb ik voor tijdschrift de tweede ronde een verhaal uit de jaren vijftig van hem vertaald ik geloof dat het voor het eerst in twintig jaar was maar het was een mooi verhaal zoals ook de goelag archipel nog steeds heel meeslepend is
1004068 het is een combinatie van een roman en een historisch werk zoals ook oorlog en vrede dat is al neigt solzjenitsyn erg naar het historische element tolstoj had meer oog voor het spannende verhaal dat de lezers k verwachten
1004069 dat is zonde die boeken zijn erg de moeite waard
1004070 een boek als kankerpaviljoen is erg goed net als in de eerste cirkel
1004071 zijn conservatieve opvattingen zullen hem in het westen veel lezers hebben gekost maar grote schrijvers keren altijd weer terug in de belangstelling met brodsky was hij de belangrijkste russische auteur van de tweede helft van de vorige eeuw zijn tijd komt wel weer
1004072 dat boek was bedoeld om een steentje bij te dragen aan zijn strijd tegen het communisme om de achtergronden duidelijk te maken en om te laten zien dat hij geen geheim agent van het westen was destijds waren er nog veel mensen in het westen die dachten dat alle russen communisten waren die heeft hij de ogen geopend zijn laatste boek ligt nog overal in sint petersburg op de toonbanken van de boekwinkels een omstreden interpretatie van geschiedenis van hoe de russische overheid de afgelopen tweehonderd jaar de joden heeft behandeld ik weet niet of het een goed idee is als veel mensen dat lezen

1004074 i went on a date with a guy for the 1st time almost 2 weeks ago we both had a great time lots in common made each other laugh you get it anyway we had 4 days of some flirtatious texting then 2 days of radio silence i reached out to him asking if he wanted to meet up for a drink and we did and i just didnt get the same vibe as our 1st date he did text me the next day but nothing in nearly 3 days his life is pretty full right now work wise is he disinterested i would love to reach out to him but i am wondering if i should just let it ride and or write him off
1004075 ik was bijzonder vriendelijk voor de politiemannen die me beschermden en zij waren scrupuleus en zouden zich nooit zo wreedaardig tegenover mij gedragen hebben aan het eind van de negen jaar waarin ik van hun bescherming genoot hebben we zelfs een feestje gehouden

1004093 i can tell you very clearly that the minute a conflict of interest occurs in the caregiver client relationship she has to withdraw as the caregiver
1004094 she cant ethically continue to gather information or share information betray that trust without disclosing to her client that she is sharing what he believes is confidential privileged information
1004095 the remaining allegations about murderous ideas and plans sound so foreign to me that in the absence of contemporaneously documented evidence i would have to consider them items of ms duleys vivid imagination or information fed to her by the people she communicated with outside the therapeutic environment
1004096 it is not at all surprising to me that a patient whose therapist is serving as a double agent therapist and accuser would become very angry with the therapist and might make some rather dramatic expressions of that anger
1004097 i think all of the circumstances put him in a place where he felt he had no place to go

1004321 ahora bien si el sistema se rompe y catalu a se lleva sus aeropuertos y a baleares le entregan porque va a pedirlos sus aeropuertos y al final a cada uno le dan su aeropuerto
1004322 lo que no va a hacer es no reclamar los suyos
1004323 prefiere sin ninguna duda y como todo el pp que se mantenga el sistema nacional de aeropuertos antes de que se disgregue

1004339 tenemos posibilidades enormes de negociar el s bado habl con el presidente bush y fui muy claro en decirle que no era posible que dos pa ses importante como eeuu e india que est n negociando un acuerdo nuclear no tengan condiciones de llegar a un acuerdo en el asunto de alimentos porque es muy poco lo que hay de diferencia
1004340 porque vamos a concluir el acuerdo de la ronda de doha puede demorar otro mes dos meses pero vamos a concluirla
1004341 vamos a continuar insistiendo todos saben que soy terco y por tanto vamos a conquistar eso es apenas un asunto de tiempo
1004342 cuando le pedimos a los europeos que flexibilicen su mercado agr cola y cuando le pedimos a eeuu que reduzca su subsidios a la agricultura es porque queremos que los pa ses pobres puedan venderle sus productos a los ricos y que motivados produzcan muchos m s granos y comida as no tendr amos una crisis de alimentos como la que estamos viviendo hoy
1004343 lo que queremos de verdad es una ronda que permita que haya justicia en su conclusi n final
1004344 y seguiremos insistiendo en la reducci n de los subsidios porque es una verg enza muy grande que los ricos subsidien sus productos para exportar eso causa muchos da os a la competitividad

1004375 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1004376 replaced at a later date so that we can get oil into the market
1004377 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1004378 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
1004379 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
1004380 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
1004381 its another example of short term political posturing from washington not the long term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil
1004382 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
1004383 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
1004384 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
1004385 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
1004386 all ears were tuned to fridays call for management to clearly and calmly articulate data supporting chesapeakes thesis that haynesville shale is for real we agree
1004387 our target remains 125 and we dont see any better way to play haynesville barnett marcellus or fayetteville
1004388 our drilling and completion segment while attaining higher levels of both revenue and operating income compared to the first quarter of 2008 faced short term challenges due to the labor and political environment in argentina
1004389 humanas strong second quarter results and raised outlook are consistent with our belief that the sector has reached a valuation inflection point
1004390 we think the recent reassuring results from the three largest companies in the sector in addition to humanas results today are enough evidence to believe that 2008 margins and guidance have stabilized
1004391 it has become increasingly clear that the current consumer downturn is likely to be a prolonged one
1004392 however average fares now seem likely to be lower for longer thereby diluting the full year average fare improvement
1004393 with consumer and business confidence falling and sky high oil prices the situation will get a lot worse
1004394 mostly driven by short covering ahead of new chief executive bob steels meeting with the sell side analysts
1004395 we would be defensive and take profits ahead of the meeting as the reality is there are no easy fixes near term at wachovia
1004396 we have seen this same story play out several times before during this current credit cycle where share prices have risen ahead of fundamentals following ceo changes
1004397 we are very early in the downgrade cycle earnings only recently peaked and have yet to really fall outside financials they said
1004398 given the attractive value that we perceive to be on offer in the market and high liquidity in investor portfolios we think that the results should be supportive for the market

1004400 if everything goes well he will have his medical on tuesday and could make his debut in a friendly match on friday toulon president mourad boudjellal said
1004401 personal reasons widely cited for williams departure began to emerge
1004402 i am obviously disappointed to learn of this through media reports greenberg said
1004403 we are working in conjunction with the nrl and our respective legal teams to determine the next step but given the matter is before the courts it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage
1004404 williams will be in toulon on monday or tuesday he said
1004405 we have discussed things with his agents and we are going to try and complete the move
1004406 it is known that keli lane frequented this house prior to the birth of tegan and we believe she may have visited there shortly after leaving auburn hospital
1004407 the next phase of his professional life that he would do that with his family
1004408 peter was very up front the day after the election he did the right thing by the party he made his intentions clear and that was that he wasnt available for the leadership of the party
1004409 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
1004410 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
1004411 if there are more incidents people will start to ask for other airlines but we havent had anything like that now
1004412 we are concerned we dont know anything if these guys want to do something we dont like we will see them in court
1004413 the recipients family were grateful the heart has come from someone who was loved as much as doujon was
1004414 i know as time passes the family is going to want to know them as extended family like they will probably want to know us as extended family
1004415 oliver zammit met the guy and his wife he said they were absolutely beautiful people thats why he made the decision with rosemarie to donate his sons heart
1004416 ive had the pleasure of meeting the person taking his heart and his wife and his heart could not have gone to a better family
1004417 theres no mechanism to check every photo before its put up and thats what people ought to be doing
1004418 you dont know the photos are there until you actually go to google and have a look
1004419 with street view you can case out someones house without having to go there
1004420 if it shows easy entry to a building someone might want to break in through the way its shown on google
1004421 we liaised with privacy groups and the government at the very beginning of the project
1004422 we sought and received very detailed privacy advice and analysis even before we started
1004423 its automated because as you can imagine there are tens of millions of images and the images are not rendered with human intervention
1004424 some people may still not want particular imagery they consider to be sensitive to appear so theres a very easy tool to remove it
1004425 kindergarten children can be very difficult they are often untamed and some come from disruptive backgrounds
1004426 the purpose is to get help for the student it is really time out for the student to rethink their behaviour and for the school and the family to come up with strategies
1004427 these figures show the need for counsellors in schools to contribute to this process but unfortunately there is a shortage of them
1004428 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1004429 you have a cocktail of conditions that add up to extreme stress on the athlete
1004430 with these readings you are talking more than 20 times a high day in sydney or melbourne and 10 times the most extreme pollution day in sydney or melbourne
1004431 on those days back home asthmatics are told to stay inside
1004432 when you add the elements of heat humidity and athletes pushing themselves to the brink it is quite possible an athlete will die during these olympics
1004433 but its actually better today with the haze over than it was yesterday with the bright sun
1004434 i dont know how well go with breathing but i struggled a lot more with yesterdays heat than today
1004435 fortunately our courts only 8m by 8m and theres two teams one on each side of the net 16m we dont have to look too far well be right
1004436 the air quality being a bit thicker i did feel it today when i got out of bed i think itll take todays training session to probably work through that we just literally suck it up and get on with it and thats what were here to do
1004437 politically they just wont reschedule events it would be a humiliation for beijing
1004438 but from a health and safety perspective organisers coaches and administrators do have a duty of care to ensure their athletes are not put at risk
1004439 it wont so much affect the sprinters but for middle distance and long distance athletes there is a big risk certainly if we were in australia endurance events would be put off
1004440 there has been a rise in temperature and humidity over the past few days it has been balmy and muggy like it is pre thunder which is perfect
1004441 a swarm keeps predators away birds tend to eat about one in 10 of the ants
1004442 the majority wont find anywhere available and if they try to join an existing colony they will be killed
1004443 gt southall black sisters sbs won an important legal challenge affirming its right to exist and continue its work
1004444 from hong kong to singapore to tokyo to beijing and sydney they get it but here in the valley theres push back to the idea that china poses a threat to the valleys continued tech dominance it took me a while to realize why the valley really is threatened and rather than confront the challenge prefers to remain in a state of denial its easier in the short term the questions im asked here in the valley mostly center on chinese government politics internet censorship counterfeiting and pollution sure these are big issues but theres very little curiosity about what new technologies are being developed in china its just a given that there really arent any so why bother asking
1004445 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level
1004446 we dont need people and we dont need to provide service mentality
1004447 see hes a good guy considerate and able to articulate the pain of love succinctly that feeling in your heart its gas
1004448 that is a truly wonderful way to process any foreign substance the continued existence of chemists shows that we dont place enough emphasis on the importance of rubbing of things into eyes as a society except of course that sometimes when you put things in your eye it hurts yeah theres that pumkin learns this the hard way when her eyes threatened to leap from her face after her mistreatment dont ever put cayenne pepper in your eye
1004449 i understand spanking but smacking is he planning on being inappropriate in bed what am i asking
1004450 it was good to score against milan in a good game but it is only a friendly game and i look forward to the beginning of the season
1004451 six goals is good but it doesnt matter i am just looking to score goals more important will be portsmouth and i hope i can do the same then
1004452 ok whoever you are i know youre one of my sisters
1004453 the focus in new retail construction is on the shopping experience

1004455 you feel more like taking a stroll down the sidewalk
1004456 recommended the possibility of using raised pedestrian crossings known as speed tables
1004457 we use that same format on the park road here at the veterans memorial park by the town hall
1004458 but when you have a knee injury you just never know
1004459 i have been getting a progress report from the doctor every day
1004460 hes getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the training ground i hope he will be ready to start training next week but he will not play until he is in good condition
1004461 this game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
1004462 today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games
1004463 he was playing against a big club and to get four goals against milan for his confidence it is fantastic and anelka today and in the last game played more inside the penalty area than before
1004464 people kept asking me about the appearance record when i was trying to win the premier league and champions league so it is a relief not to have it there any more
1004465 of course i am proud to have done it but now i just want to move on hopefully add a few more games to the total and focus on the team
1004466 there is a stigma of celebrity and money alongside football these days which is different from when i first came into the team
1004467 now you see players with nice cars and 18 year olds on good money
1004468 but its down to the individual having the right attitude and application its not enough just to have the talent
1004469 i have seen players with plenty of ability no shortage of that whatsoever but they didnt make it because they did not have enough hunger to sacrifice things in order to succeed
1004470 i leave the real partying to the young lads they can handle it better
1004471 i am sure paul will do well because he knows his stuff
1004472 he has done things a different way to my other team mates he started right at the bottom and did brilliantly at macclesfield and mk dons
1004473 some people would say that is the proper way of doing things he has proven himself now he just has to do it in the premier league
1004474 he will get a lot of respect because he has done it all as a player
1004475 but that only gets you so far because you have got to know your stuff
1004476 does not rise to the level of materiality that would be likely to cause a different result at a new trial
1004477 was a reasonable probability of a different outcome which is
1004478 informing co conspirators of the activities of the conspiracys members furthers the conspiracy
1004479 but due to some apparent docketing irregularities the amended complaint was not entered on the electronic docket until some months later
1004480 we cannot affirm on the basis of a discretion that the district court did not exercise

1004482 providing gillette stadium with the worlds most trusted turf system in 2006 was one of the high points in our companys history
1004483 the patriots have an outstanding record on fieldturf while the new england revolution can enjoy playing on the fifa 2 star recommended surface that has proven itself at every level of soccer this superliga final being played on fieldturf re affirms what hundreds of top level soccer organizations worldwide have come to realize fieldturf is the industrys best soccer specific artificial turf pitch
1004484 it is flat and the ball rolls well on it
1004485 with the levers of power having been wrested from the hands of his antagonists there is no realistic possibility that the petitioners pro convergence sympathies will place him in the haitian governments cross hairs
1004486 i dont know why they are so much in a hurry for this law anything done under pressure will not be workable
1004487 if i fight those ufc guys it will be as the wec champion there are a lot of tough guys a lot of them believe me but you just have to fight whoever they tell you to fight im proud to be the wec champion and whoever i fight whenever i fight wherever i fight ill do it as the wec champion
1004488 we were on the beach when everyone suddenly started running towards the dunes
1004489 i couldnt watch but i heard later he had died
1004490 kids play in the dunes but no one realised the dangers of how a bit of adventure can lead to someone losing their life
1004491 a huge tunnel had been dug that people were able to walk through
1004492 but it became unsteady and unfortunately collapsed around the young boy
1004493 he was trapped in the sand for approximately 20 minutes
1004494 its just a tragic accident that could have been prevented but unfortunately children dont see danger
1004495 people think that the sea is the danger when they are at the beach but sand can be a killer too
1004496 wet sand as we had on sunday after rain makes it easier for tunnelling but sand is very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
1004497 we have had a lot of rainfall over the last few days the sand had become quite compact and obviously very dense as well i believe the tunnel was huge they were able to walk through and it became unsteady and unfortunately collapsed around the young boy its just a tragic accident that could have been prevented but unfortunately children dont see danger sand is always very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
1004498 the court did not decide on the merits of the petition it just issued a tro to maintain the status quo
1004499 submits to the sound discretion of the court which is the ultimate arbiter of issues and so effectively the signing of the agreement will have to be cancelled
1004500 this will be a good opportunity also for some issues to be threshed out and so we welcome this action taken by the court
1004501 confident that the court will uphold the position of the negotiating panel
1004502 taking advantage of poor people by lending them money on terms that are sure to fail
1004503 it is rich people taking advantage of poor people by lending them money on terms that are sure to fail people of great wealth and their institutions like banks naturally have the power to overwhelm people of lesser means and you cant allow that in a decent society it wont survive
1004504 where were the gatekeepers where were the watchdogs why did it take the fed so long to put an end to the predatory practices
1004505 secrets of the temple how the federal reserve runs the country
1004506 to make the story overly crude the u s congress repealed the law against usury it was done in 1980 by a democratic congress with a democratic president jimmy carter and of course the republicans all piled on and voted for it and that was the first stroke only the first of many in which they stripped away the regulatory laws from the financial system and from banking they set up a political climate that shouted lets get government out of the way and that was very appealing as framed by president ronald reagan and other conservatives
1004507 greenspans bubbles the age of ignorance at the federal reserve
1004508 you had this very powerful industrial sector banking and finance that wanted and had pushed for years to get out from under the regulatory controls limits on interest rates the law against usury the merger of commercial banks with investment banks which had been prohibited in the new deal because it caused the disaster of 1929 during the last generation 25 30 years ago the fed the central bank that regulates money and credit tipped hard in one direction towards capital in favor of capital and against labor
1004509 even harder for debt ridden people to wipe clean their financial slates by declaring bankruptcy
1004510 so at the same time the fed was helping to keep wages down in order to keep inflation from escalating its policies were nonetheless helping banks and investors to inflate the cost of the value of their assets beyond reality right
1004511 thats it at one point writing in the nation i somewhat playfully and wickedly referred to alan greenspan the fed chairman as the one eyed chairman
1004512 the point i want to make though is that it is deeper than a politician rolling over for his campaign contributor the guys who finance the democratic party or the republican party they do that too but they were sold a fantasy an illusion which sounded wonderful about how markets make better judgments than government and the public and that liberating finance and business from prudential rules that society imposes upon them will produce a bigger better economy and better returns for everyone all those fantasies have been destroyed by these events i mean wiped out
1004513 a better metaphor instead of putting them to sleep would be castration
1004514 the trillion dollar meltdown easy money high rollers and the great credit crash
1004515 who will tell the people the betrayal of american democracy

1004518 we need the uafa to become law because the united states does not recognize same sex relationships at the federal level
1004519 gay and lesbian couples are denied the protections of more than 1 100 federal laws that come with a federally recognized marriage one of the most critical of these being immigration rights
1004520 no one should have to choose between their partner and their country
1004521 but without legislation like the uafa in place thats exactly whats happening to gays and lesbians in the united states
1004522 out4immigration is encouraged that we now have 100 co sponsors of this legislation in the house and 14 for the bill in the senate s 1328 but there is a lot more work ahead if these bills are going to come up for a floor vote to those lawmakers sitting on the fence with this legislation we ask them if you were forced to choose between your country and the person you love what would you do

1004567 i am the light of the world whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life
1004568 if youre competing against a guy from another squad that gets your attention
1004569 after being on the sidelines it felt good to be back out there
1004570 im glad my calf held up today it felt good
1004571 i think the opportunity to go against the raiders will really benefit this team its going to be exciting
1004572 theyre our local rivals and were looking forward to it
1004573 weve been beating on each other for the past week and a half now the competition has been kind of monotonous so its nice to switch it up and go against another color
1004574 this is the 2nd year we have done the pasta bowl and we are thrilled we were sold out as early as june this year
1004575 major corporations throughout the south bay are dedicated to coming to this event and helping out the non profit organizations it is important for the 49ers foundation to raise awareness of the needs at risk youth have in the south bay and the 49ers foundation is all about keeping bay area youth safe on track and in school this event each year raises the money necessary to help fulfill our mission
1004576 being a local guy this event is a great opportunity for me to give back to the community i grew up in i know what its like for teens and kids to grow up here and i think serving the community and helping these at risk youth is very important
1004577 we had two players back out they were ashley lelie and kentwan balmer delanie walker was held out he had some headaches but hell be fine i just wanted to hold him out for today other than that everything is kind of status quo with the guys theyll be about a half dozen guys that dont go up to napa that will not scrimmage tomorrow so well keep them down here so that they can continue to get treatment because it will be a long day well practice early and then well practice late in the evening so theyll stay and they wont be up in napa other than that everybody else should be up there practicing
1004578 michael robinson mark roman david baas jerard rabb the wide receiver lewis baker the defensive back and parys haralson parys shoulder is a little banged up so i want to keep him down here to get some treatment on that
1004579 weve got about 15 training camp days left and weve scripted those things out it should be five five and five one of these might count as one of the 15 left but rather than whos first whos second the rest of the way we kind of scripted out from first second and third team i only say that because id have to go and look at my notes to see whos winning where and what but like i said the objective is to get them all with the different groups and thats what our next 15 look like
1004580 tomorrow were going to try to get all three of them work up there with the first unit and try to get them in with their better units as well i dont know exactly how theyre the raiders are going to rotate their guys exactly because every team does it a little bit different and so well see how that works out our objective is to try to get them good work good on good as we can
1004581 the discussion that time will be just to make sure that all the scripts are intact you know for example if weve got a 16 play script make sure were on the same page with that somebody doesnt have 14 somebody doesnt have 16 and where the drills will take place on the field what offense will be on what field what defense will be on what field things like that the things that kind of go unnoticed out here and just making sure its organized
1004582 ill be able to get some of that tonight im sure that some of the questions between coordinators will be some of that theyll say hey who are you going to have in and how are you going to rep your guys that way the coordinators mike martz on offense and greg manusky on defense can kind of say this is what ill do theyll try their best to match that sometimes it just doesnt work out for example if there going on a three play sequence and were on a four play sequence that all really sets it off we might adjust ours but we might leave it and say in the end that this guys going to come up too short but we live with it
1004583 it means that the night meeting will take place in the middle of the day thats really what it means
1004584 not since ive been here not as a head coach i have not as an assistant ive done it ive done it several times we did it with the redskins against the steelers back then i think every year i was there with denver we did it against the cardinals back then they used to come up to denver theres probably one or two other times but i dont recall
1004585 yeah i thought that they were very beneficial the objective for both teams is to work against some other people and weve got to keep it on that level thats why i say its not a scrimmage it will be a practice as weve had thus far so there will be no live to the ground type of drills i think that sometimes is where it gets a little heated at the same time theyll be competing its important to them i know all the guys will take pride in what theyre doing and if someone feels that theyve gone too far somebody might try to get an understanding but i hope that both teams have a good understanding i believe they will otherwise we wouldnt be doing it
1004586 i contacted lane kiffin and scot also spoke with al davis because obviously if als not in favor of it it doesnt matter much what lane and i try to discuss al davis at the time had reservations about the live factor and i assured scot and him that thats not our objective im sure lane did the same thing we want to keep it on that tempo
1004587 i dont know him very well we went against each other in the senior bowl im talking about when we talked we went against each other last year in preseason but we didnt speak obviously because there wasnt any need to but at the senior bowl we talked a couple of times he was going through some things then i dont know him all that well weve spoken but its a strictly professional relationship
1004588 it gets the players attention it does if youre competing against a guy from another squad it does get your attention hes not going to take the down off
1004589 yeah he didnt mean to i was kidding him right there as a matter of fact and he got defensive and sensitive for a second and then i kind of laughed so he knew he just grabbed him by the jersey and he happened to fall down but it wasnt anything
1004590 sorry but 1500 to go to mexico for 2 weeks over christmas to attend the wedding of someone i dont even remember looks like is way too much im not going
1004591 an examination of us consumer pet related and veterinary service expenditures 1980 2005
1004592 because the probability of veterinary service expenditures was strongly related to household income caution is suggested in planning provision of veterinary services when incomes are constrained among households with pet related expenditures the decreasing percentage of households with veterinary service expenditures suggests a growing proportion of pet owners who are not having their veterinary service needs met because non white households were less likely to purchase veterinary services the veterinary profession cannot afford to delay efforts to enhance diversity and cultural competence
1004593 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated
1004594 around this fall we will be looking at beating the bushes and responding to more public rfps
1004595 we see a lot of work for ourselves through january 2009
1004596 but i couldnt say what the middle to the end of the year will be like
1004597 these numbers are a continuation of weak conditions in the non residential construction sector
1004598 its likely we are several months away from a turnaround
1004599 were not subject to the volatile ups and downs in the commercial sector
1004600 its more of a hold your own situation profits are significantly lower across the country as people see the effects of the recession there are fewer opportunities out there so theres less work to spread around were taking care of our clients who have work and thats the best thing that we can do
1004601 the arizona market went so far down i dont know how long it will take for it to come back
1004602 we certainly expect uae work to continue and to pick up

1004612 singapore telecommunications ltd southeast asias largest telecoms firm will launch apple incs third generation iphone sic in singapore before the end of august a source familiar with the matter told reuters
1004613 singtel the largest listed company said in june it would offer the iphone but did not provide a date for the release
1004614 apple is about to launch a nano version of the hugely successful iphone it is expected to be in the shops in time for christmas
1004615 the product will be launched in the uk at up to 150 for pay as you go customers by o2 the mobile phone group owned by spains telefonica this will be a big one said an industry source
1004616 researchers at the university of california berkley have developed a novel method to squeeze light into extremely small spaces an important hurdle that optical computing faced previously researchers could get light to fit in relatively small spaces even as small as 200 nm about 400 times smaller than a human hair this size helps to dictate the necessary size for the smallest fiber optic fibers which for various reasons are about five times this width or about 1 m wide
1004617 with the breakthrough researchers were able to cut light down to fit into spaces a mere 10 nm 20 times smaller than ever before
1004618 mr oulton theorizes that the advance and further compression will yield key breakthroughs due to the properties of electricity and magnetism in order to achieve an optical computer you would need at least some electrical components however the vastly different scales of electricity and light mean that they do not interact neatly or behave in similar ways he believes by shrinking light to wavelengths similar to that of electrons in computer systems a plethora of new uses will arise

1004624 the new iphone and ipod touch 2 0 software that comes installed on the 3g phone and is also available for the first generation devices means that the iphone is a now a bona fide software platform
1004625 one of the most important things that will make it much easier for apple to get the iphone into business users hands is support for exchange i had no problems syncing my exchange data to the iphone a lot of folks are dependent on exchange so this new ability has made the iphone a first class corporate citizen
1004626 for most people when they hear the name apple they think of consumer oriented products such as the ipod and iphone or of design professionals and educators using macs
1004627 most people don t immediately associated macs or apple with major business or enterprise environments and yet a recent survey by yankee group research inc found that 80 percent of businesses today use macs in some way nearly double the 47 percent reported from a similar survey performed two years earlier
1004628 to help make sense of the facts this article presents the ten most common myths and misconceptions about macs in the enterprise as well as some accurate facts
1004629 as of this week our household has 7 macs ibook g3 ibook g4 blackbook 2 20
1004630 overall however macs enjoy a good deal of security by obscurity there is a much greater payoff in developing attacks on an operating system that is used by the vast majority of users than there is to developing one employed by less than 10 percent of the population eventually as mac os x either on mac computers or in embedded form on devices like the iphone ipod touch and apple tv gains greater traction in the marketplace malware attacks and virus threats will likely become a greater issue for these reasons mac workstations shouldn t be considered immune to viruses malware or other security threats
1004631 this weekend in san francisco the second annual iphonedevcamp 2 took place whereas the first confab focused primarily on web applications this one has a definite native application flavor thanks in large part to the fact that the iphone software development kit sdk is out of beta and now available for developers
1004632 at iphonedevcamp this year there s a greater and more palpable sense of excitement in the air than last year and it s reminding me of the time when i was writing applications for another apple handheld product the newton
1004633 while the green device from apple was not a commercial success
1004634 fourteen years ago the newton could fax send email and receive pages the iphone is a communications powerhouse with 3g edge wi fi bluetooth
1004635 newton s handwriting recognition was dramatically improved with newton os 2 0 in 1995 the iphone has fantastic chinese and japanese character recognition

1004638 in their defense we had a hard time shooting at that time because of sightlines and depth perception benilde coach john moore said
1004639 we expect teams that havent been here before to struggle shooting it helped being accustomed to the surroundings
1004640 we were able to get some rebounds and get out running
1004641 it didnt help to have your senior quarterback sitting on the bench for eight nine minutes it didnt help the flow of the game
1004642 hes their primary ballhandler so we wanted to get him out of the game
1004643 the project is not seeking to solve any major burning complex socio political or theological question it is simply about showing a sunny positive face of muslims which people dont tend to see
1004644 we initially hoped to go to new york city for obvious symbolic reasons ironically we couldnt get in
1004645 i wanted to do something that said these people dont represent me they dont represent my community
1004646 in the arab world having the name osama is the same as having the name john in canada
1004647 but here it is slightly different because youre not just another average joe its osama there is a certain awkwardness when people hear you say it
1004648 at this point in time now that it has been a couple years there should be no reason to be shocked
1004649 i am hoping that it will reduce eventually and that people will realize there are a thousand osamas out there
1004650 using a natural renewable fiber like point6 merino is a great environmental foundation for our company
1004651 our membership in 1 for the planet complements our already sustainable by nature products and allows us to increase what we give back as we increase what we take in
1004652 we applaud the puc decision because it affirms the ability to install clean affordable renewable energy projects for nonprofit organizations
1004653 i think the decision will allow the growing solar market we have in oregon to really blossom
1004654 we think that the developers continue to narrowly define the resource of this one site
1004655 we feel some kind of historic resource should be considered more because what makes an historic district is the variety of older buildings and how these properties interact with one another
1004656 even though it came close to getting built before and its smaller now a lot of whats in the neighborhood has changed in terms of development activity
1004657 i think we have a pretty good case so labels like nimby dont apply

1004681 your registration and attendance make you eligible for these great prizes
1004682 why have just one hoe when you can have a hoegaarden
1004683 if you think about how an operating system is loaded
1004684 its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine
1004685 the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
1004686 midori is one of many incubation projects underway at microsoft its simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it
1004687 the real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing
1004688 within the microsoft environment we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others
1004689 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
1004690 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware
1004691 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
1004692 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
1004693 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
1004694 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold
1004695 thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get
1004696 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
1004697 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
1004698 i came to realise how much we take at face value
1004699 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
1004700 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
1004701 obviously it isnt perfectly flat thanks to geological phenomena like hills and valleys it is around 24 900 miles in diameter

1004705 the space agencies of the world are involved in an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit
1004706 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
1004707 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
1004708 as a rule of thumb we dont have any fears of aircraft or other modes of transportation
1004709 flat earth theory is one of the ultimate conspiracy theories
1004710 naturally flat earth believers think that the moon landings were faked as were the photographs of earth from space
1004711 it is always good to question how we know what we know but it is also good to have the ability to accept compelling evidence such as the photographs of earth from space

1004719 of course we could get easier opponents but i am not disappointed with the draw as i lived and played in spain for years at fc barcelona between 1992 and 1997
1004720 it will be easy for me to get some info about our opponents and i know spanish football well
1004721 we are not favourites so anything we achieve against deportivo will be good they will be an attractive opponent for our fans and with a little luck we will get to the next round deportivo are definitely a strong team but not so much that we could say we dont have a chance
1004722 we have two big games ahead and we are not without hope
1004723 our biggest advantages are that deportivos domestic season does not start until 31 august and we are playing the first match away from home they dont know much about us so we can surprise them and in front of so many of our fans in the second leg we cant play badly

1004961 our numbers for learn to dive usually i wouldnt say double but certainly go up i would say maybe 30 to 40 per cent
1004962 the body regions that were most injured were the head and neck along with injuries to the face this accounts for about 60 per cent of all the diving related injuries
1004963 and specifically the types of injuries that we saw were lacerations soft tissue injuries were the most common diagnoses followed by strains and sprains and fractures
1004964 about 77 per cent were forward facing about 22 per cent were backward
1004965 more than 80 per cent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to a metre so thats not very high about 17 per cent were injured at a dive height of greater than one metre
1004966 once i slipped off the board i wasnt doing a dive i was just not paying attention and it was very early in the morning i scraped my shin but that was about it
1004967 if youre going to a country club pool or a recreational type pool or a backyard pool youre not going to have the same kind of safety that you would have at a training centre that is teaching the sport competitively
1004968 because if youre using the correct technique really the incidence of any kind of injury is quite rare
1004969 my first advice to them is youre not a trained diver like they are
1004970 so first and foremost if youre going to enter the water enter the water feet first thats the safest way to get into any kind of water even if its somewhere youve swam several times
1004971 often youve misjudged the depth of the water or you forget that things do change especially in a lake or a river or an open body of water where the bottom will change and where hazards will float through as a result of currents
1004972 we encourage people to go out and be healthy and active and hopefully safe while youre doing these activities
1004973 one of the things i remembered from when i was about 13 is i watched my first olympics and it was mexico city in 68 and it really had a profound effect on me

1005062 i was convicted for raping a 12 year old black girl and everyone in prison knew that

1005073 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point

1005083 that autumn i learned from my own experience that a man can cross the threshold of death while occupying a body that is still not dead your blood still circulates and your stomach digests things but psychologically you have completed all your preparations for death and lived through death itself although you have never regarded yourself as a christian sometimes indeed the opposite now you suddenly notice that you have already forgiven everyone who has insulted you

1005093 from the perspective of economic theory the line between personal and corporate saving is thin and somewhat arbitrary
1005094 the official personal saving measures do not measure wealth accumulation in the form of capital gains they provide inconsistent treatment of durable goods payments from corporations inflation and taxes they are affected by demographic factors and they provide no information on the distribution of saving across households
1005095 households are largely saving adequately but other interpretations are possible

1005121 dovie is my best friend i love dovie i love him so much that im able to complain about him and bother him whenever i darn feel like it
1005122 dovbear a man with his hashkafas in the right place that is assuming you think the right place is bashing chassidim superstition the zohar spirituality and kugel which i do
1005123 dov bear has fantastic attributes candor loyalty truth courage a razor sharp mind and he flatters no one
1005124 dovbear does have a nice blog and i am a daily visitor but dont tell him i said so
1005125 hes witty hes funny he appreciates the ridiculous in life and has no qualms about telling you when he thinks that youre being a moron

1005135 jason buckner and i did a presentation at the previous barcamp about openid and threw in a quick plug for tinyid us
1005136 i look at other games that have come out more recently that are action rpgs and apart from changing where the camera is i think were doing quite a bit more than what theyve done
1005137 coming at it from the rpg side i dont think we did stick to the formula in a lot of ways
1005138 i feel that diablo ii had a lot of room to grow in terms of the story and the rpg i look at other games that have come out more recently that are action rpgs and apart from changing where the camera is i think were doing quite a bit more than what theyve done we could have done a completely different game style but that wouldnt have been diablo iii
1005139 its not like theres been a ton of great diablo clones out there
1005140 its a pretty small genre that hasnt evolved very much in its gameplay its the game we wanted to play and we assume the game our fans would want to play that said there are some new features that we havent announced yet that take it away from what the previous games did but still at its core its a true sequel
1005141 people associate the camera with isometric and say oh why didnt you update the tech well we did update the tech the camera has nothing to do with tech the camera is all about gameplay isometric gameplay is very different from fps or over the shoulder thirdperson which is pretty much what the entire industry is moving towards but then some of the biggest hits of the last year were guitar hero and rock band and those were not high tech games gameplay is what matters its whats always mattered to us
1005142 i think the most obvious kind of thing to look at is the addition of physics
1005143 i think it just makes combat feel better which is essentially its goal weve added a lot of opportunities to use the environment against people or interact with it the environments of diablo i and ii felt very much like a box for monsters and being able to make them feel a lot more alive is really the thing that weve brought up the technology to do
1005144 with our outdoor environments weve focused a lot more on static environments theres not the complete randomness that there was with diablo ii and thats mainly to give the world a feeling of reality
1005145 what we did was to come up with adventures which allows us to cut huge blocks out of the outdoor areas and stick whatever we want in there so the next town is always to the north but you dont know if youre going to encounter a camp along the way or a lost caravan or a summoning ritual there are all these different kinds of events and you dont know where they are going to appear theres still a reason to explore and thats really what randomness provides the encounters are all random so you dont know whats around the next corner
1005146 we have an assortment of layouts with randomised entrances and exits or we go for the full randomised dungeon which is essentially a bunch of components that get reassembled together and all of them can also have adventures as well

1005148 in an urgent memo sent to gop members and staff saturday
1005149 i dont think you beat obama by saying that hes paris hilton
1005150 the more important thing is really to look at is he who he says he is is he really this great reformer
1005151 its not that obama is a bad person its just that hes like all the rest of them not a reformer not a messiah just like all the rest of them in washington and just like all the other liberals too
1005152 too many of those criticizing obama have been content merely to slander him
1005153 an intellectual laziness among the very people who should be carefully scrutinizing obama
1005154 an hour later he was already calling the sun times back to clarify his comments
1005155 he was received well and said all the things he needed to say from an israeli perspective
1005156 got the same level of attention that axel rose got when he came here
1005157 she feels much better now that the morphine has kicked in
1005158 if i would have know that every 3rd call its going to open up my web browser with no ability to toggle it off i would have not purchased it in addition i always click on the lowest rating when it brings up that quality feedback web page despite how really wonderfull the quality of the call was just due to not being given a choice about the popup
1005159 why not let users have the choice of giving feedback or not since ebay took over ive seen a variety of these type of things that control your user experience like the previous poster if we all put in negative feedback in the voice quality page perhaps skype will realize that the loss of real feedback is a serious enough problem to allow free choice for the user
1005160 1 advertising is the creation of a disconnected era when businesses needed some way to get a message out to prospective customers that they couldnt reach directly the purpose of an ad is to motivate the prospect to get in touch the web as we all know puts us all in direct real time contact with each other wherever we are in the world instead of advertising a message and waiting haplessly for a response businesses can proactively connect directly with their prospects reaching out to them in contexts where theyre ready to buy what counts on the web is product placement merchandising and other forms of direct promotion
1005161 2 placing ads in software is the height of absurdity its software for goodness sake people use it to get things done not to read ads instead of wasting valuable screen space publishing banners and text ads why not embed some functional links buttons and menu options that add some value to the task in hand cut out the ads and substitute a direct connection to a useful service add a pay per use clipart library to an online slideshow editor embed a link to a live tax expert in an online accounting application build workflow into an online travel booking service that conveniently helps the buyer choose and book flights transfers hotel and dinner
1005162 3 there will never be enough online advertising in the world to support the software industry let alone the entire web below is a slide taken from a presentation i gave a couple of years ago to an auditorium full of marketing professionals called you guessed it web 2 0 and the end of advertising while its true that software is a smaller industry than advertising both of them pale into significance when you look at the entire value of the retail industry or even more if you measure the total value of a years global trade instead of trying to carve up the bite sized advertising pie on demand providers should claim a slice of all those real world transactions by making it easier for sellers to find buyers
1005163 there needs to be a reliable infrastructure for measuring whatever is due to each partipant in the partnership and there needs to be highly effective workflow so that the user experience is seamless and convenient the ease of funding everything through advertising has meant the giants of web 2 0 and many venture funded startups have neglected the more sophisticated infrastructure needed to support such functionality
1005164 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
1005165 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks for our mission critical applications this experience demonstrates the value companies looking at virtualized recovery solutions can gain by tapping sungards expertise rather than handling internally
1005166 server virtualization will dramatically change the it recovery services model for both the services provider and the customer with replication to a shared storage infrastructure and a virtualized server infrastructure customers can enjoy improved recovery time and recovery point objectives without the cost of dedicated and custom recovery solutions from the dr service provider
1005167 the achilles heel of most virtualized it environments is that they rely on a single data center to facilitate system failover should an event occur

1005266 en espa a se ha avanzado mucho en los ltimos 30 a os sin que eso quiera decir que para bien antes de la constituci n espa ola los menores no ten an derechos pero hoy los tienen todos sin hacer distinci n entre ni os de 0 a 18 a os todos estos derechos se han convertido en obligaciones para los mayores y al ser una cuesti n de orden p blico nos corresponde a todos intervenir padres educadores etc
1005267 las cosas han cambiado mucho con la democracia hemos pasado del autoritarismo al colegueo con los hijos
1005268 hoy en d a un azote se considera maltrato y si le negamos algo al ni o podemos causarle un trauma la situaci n puede llegar al extremo de un continuo no me toques que te denuncio nos ha dado miedo poner l mites y en esta democracia en la que vivimos no ha interesado transmitir que los menores tambi n tienen deberes y no solo derechos
1005269 el profesor est desprotegido la escuela ha quedado como segundo escal n y los educadores no deber an caer tampoco en el colegueo con los alumnos
1005270 que los padres ejerzan de padres que los profesores recuperen la autoridad y que los pol ticos no presuman de joven democracia
1005271 sin embargo el contenido de las medidas es ambiguo ya que estas s lo son orientativas para los educadores y su aplicaci n depender de cada caso y situaci n

1005281 se est viendo un caso pr ctico del compromiso de todo un municipio para la reinserci n de menores delincuentes
1005282 est n jugando un papel important simo y de agradecer
1005283 pienso que la privaci n de libertad es necesaria pero al mismo tiempo deben existir medios alternativos
1005284 existen otras maneras de reparar el delito no s lo la privaci n de libertad
1005285 yo no he inventado nada s lo aplico la ley
1005286 y esta ley contempla diferentes medidas de trabajo para la comunidad libertades vigiladas que pueden ser y est n demostrando que son muy positivas
1005287 el origen de todos estos problemas de delincuencia juvenil se encuentra en la familia
1005288 y la escuela porque el 80 de los chavales que delinquen tienen malos resultados acad micos
1005289 porque creo que cualquier persona que vaya a inscribir a un hijo antes deber a pasar por una escuela de padres
1005290 los mismos que hacen la ley no se creen nada de reinserci n los pol ticos deber an creer que el trabajo es bueno

1005371 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
1005372 i love michael and i respect that he did wonders for me i respect his decision to have a few weeks off the man i believe is still a fantastic batter and one of the best in the country
1005373 one shouldnt look at the flyhalf position in isolation we were not selecting only a flyhalf
1005374 percy will never start at flyhalf while i coach but if we need to use him he will be there
1005375 if i had the choice i wouldnt have let them go being able to do that shows how privileged we are to have this depth
1005376 it is the most difficult thing for a coach to tell players they havent been selected especially in this case where no players has not been up to standard all 28 fit players in the present squad deserve to be retained but unfortunately it cannot be done
1005377 we will make suggestions and advise and if a player has preferences we will consider that we dont want to force a player into anything so that the fingers are later pointed at us
1005378 it was in the interest of the players themselves that we decided to release them to their unions so that they can get game time surely that is better than just holding tackle bags all week
1005379 with this more open relationship with the unions we and the players will benefit
1005380 if you want to get to them youll have to come through us
1005381 obviously employers dont go overseas to recruit somebody for low skilled jobs
1005382 these tend to be professional and trade type of jobs
1005383 the numbers arent large in the overall scheme of things but theyre important positions that employers cant seem to fill by going to other provinces
1005384 we hadnt really done a whole lot of international recruitment before
1005385 so this is not only an opportunity for us to recruit good people but to go on a fact finding mission and see what we want to do and how exactly we want to do it
1005386 india is probably one of the best educated workforces on the continent in terms of engineers and operators for our plants
1005387 those countries beyond canada certainly provide a good labour pool
1005388 it is a global workforce and quite honestly canada is the last to leave the gate australia and new zealand have been in india recruiting very strongly
1005389 a potential source to help alleviate our labour crunch here

1005391 when im making my music and talking about blow its because i did it
1005392 when i say im rich off cocaine its because i did it i never tried to hide my past i put my name inside of all my cds my company has my ss i couldve put a company name
1005393 i never ratted on a n a i never prosecuted a n a i never locked up a n a that is first and foremost
1005394 i always felt being the man that i am and the boss that i am i never owed a n a an explanation every man gotta look his kids in the eye and have a reason for feeding them or not for that sole reason i believed in the death penalty for rats and informants
1005395 i surpassed my life goals 18 months ago but you see where i am now sitting in a new benz 100 000 grand cash in my pocket and a dirty white tee
1005396 you know im strapped to the teeth we got more bullets that we got dollars thats just how it goes and thats how its going to go until the day we die a n a dont like it get at me im the muthf kin biggest boss that you seen this far

1005399 o que for necess rio n s faremos existe a possibilidade de trocar a comiss o t cnica n o conversamos sobre a possibilidade de perman ncia ou sa da mas como disse o presidente fleury jo o augusto fleury presidente do conselho gestor temos que ter a serenidade para resolver o que melhor

1005402 must have harbored bias during the liability deliberations so it necessarily follows that her vote on the verdict was tainted
1005403 theres no question shes biased and the case law is very strong that it only takes one biased juror to invalidate the verdict
1005404 as corny as it is i cited the play twelve angry men we have a constitutional right to have every juror be henry fonda
1005405 the case law squarely says that you cant impeach a verdict based on jurors statements during deliberations
1005406 we will have ample time to refresh the jurys recollection about our case
1005407 this was a very big case obviously you like to win
1005408 we are delighted the court took the view that the case needs a new judge
1005409 microsofts motions for summary judgement were granted without a proper analysis

1005417 eu fiz algumas mudan as e procurei conversar muito mostrando que o futebol sempre nos d chance de inverter a situa o mesmo vindo de um resultado vexat rio o aspecto emocional e motivacional foi levado em conta os jogadores precisam acreditar mais neles pr prios
1005418 pecamos em algumas coisas simples a segunda bola seja defensiva ou ofensiva sempre ca a nos p s do advers rio como o sport um time entrosado que se movimenta muito e toca de primeira nos perdemos na marca o
1005419 foi bom pelos tr s pontos e ficou claro que vamos evoluir que podemos ter um time competitivo ajustando algumas pe as
1005420 teremos que ter o neg cio roxo para vencer quarta feira
1005421 o extracampo n o tem a ver faltou vontade mesmo da nossa equipe a gente tem de assumir a responsabilidade
1005422 o treinador montou um esquema muito bom para a gente a gente n o cumpriu n o fizemos nada praticamente a gente s viajou pra s o paulo isso n o pode acontecer se todo jogo fora acontece isso ent o melhor a gente n o jogar fora
1005423 esse n o foi o milan normal eles tiveram quatro ou cinco desfalques de jogadores de qualidade mas de todo modo nosso time jogou muito bem e a nossa performance de hoje foi a melhor at agora estou feliz pelo crescimento dos jogadores desde o primeiro treino
1005424 essa atua o foi importante para o anelka mas ainda mais importante para termos eu e os torcedores uma maior confian a nele fant stico para sua confian a marcar quatro vezes contra o milan
1005425 foi bom marcar contra o milan mas foi apenas um amistoso estou olhando mais adiante para o come o da temporada fico feliz de fazer gols mas mais importante ser o jogo contra o portsmouth e espero fazer o mesmo contra eles

1005440 i had a very clear vision for the type of christmas album that i wanted to make indicative of the big band orchestras of the 40s and 50s with a full compliment of horns stings woodwinds percussion and chorales davids orchestrations were a gift they embodied everything that i could have imaged unique and beautiful and yet they seem as though they were always intended for these songs
1005441 in the end that is what it is all about we all worked very hard to put this record together and i think that everyone involved worked with one common goal in mind to make the best record that we could
1005442 i knew that with the initial success of breathe that the stakes would be higher for this record
1005443 we were doing all of these major appearances and performances and i could just feel the bar rising
1005444 i follow my instinct quite often but i listen i watch and i absorb
1005445 i dont think about success in terms of chart positions and sales i make the best music that i know how
1005446 the hustle is doing what it takes to achieve your desired goal
1005447 hustle simmons is a breath of fresh air that feeling i got when i first heard beats rhymes amp life or even commons resurrect is what i got out of this album yall got my support all the way with this
1005448 i hate rap shit sucks i only listen to m
1005449 im trying to show that theres still regular guys making music
1005450 i dont talk about all of the things that most cats talk about im not a thug im not a gangster you dont have to have a hidden agenda to make good music
1005451 i djed before i was rapping and i tried graffiti but i sucked at all of them except for mcing
1005452 im a type of person that when you hear me youre gonna want to know what is he gonna say next
1005453 im the wrap up guy so when you hear my records youre not just listening to the beat
1005454 but with this album i went in a different direction ive been experimenting with a lot of live music a lot of my beats were made using live instrumentation
1005455 im not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything of that nature
1005456 i know what im good at and im gonna stick to my guns instead of trying to be something that im not i really tried to get that point across on this album
1005457 theres kids on my block with pockets full of rocks they used to think that school was cool but that came to a stop the madness setting in i know a veteran shit he fought for his country and cant afford his medicine

1005471 everybody is talking about the problem of global warming but i have a solution for it
1005472 bamboo acts as a carbon sink it absorbs excess co2 a greenhouse gas and cause of global warming in the air with three to four times more efficiency than any other tree which means the more bamboos we plant the more co2 is absorbed and thus we can stop contributing to global warming
1005473 this amount was a final payment to end mr cherneys interference in mr deripaskas business mr deripaska denies that there was any agreement to pay further amounts to mr cherney
1005474 there is significant risk that mr cherney will not obtain in russia a trial unaffected by improper interference by state actors and that substantial justice may not be done
1005475 inherent in a trial in russia assassination arrest on trumped up charges and lack of a fair trial are sufficient to make england the forum in which the case can most suitably be tried
1005476 the u s appeal courts have found that russia is an adequate judicial forum despite various shortcomings judge clarke may also have drawn conclusions about o d s mr deripaskas credibility that were against the weight of the evidence a foreign defendant in this type of application is entitled to a scrupulously fair hearing

1005484 seen from a limited perspective tech transfer boils down to what patents are developed by engineers and scientists and can be sold to businesses
1005485 seen from a larger perspective though technology transfer has implications for both the culture of origin as well as the culture of destination
1005486 for example birth control works here in the u s where a high value is placed on the education of women

1005488 i see social work turning into a therapist tradition of working with single clients in 50 minute billable hours

1005492 the problem with that approach is that almost by definition the various institutions that together make up the federal government are never going to be as nimble and responsive as non profits companies and hackers that operate outside government their role is to serve as the establishment what the article by princetons ed felten and a team of researchers from the schools center for information technology policy proposes is that government entities focus on building the infrastructure to produce and distribute data and then leave it to more capable others to create tools that make use of the it including mashups wikis and visualizations there are are only so many hours of the day even in dc and the time and energy spent building public facing websites could be poured into a more useful kind of online publishing making sure the data is clean constant and consistent

1005496 brians play in the past has sometimes been overshadowed by other outstanding players on our team so it is certainly time for him to receive this kind of recognition
1005497 i feel very honored to be part of this partnership
1005498 my fondest memories of fisk are meeting so many people from diverse backgrounds and cultures
1005499 i also realized the value of continuing my education and that i would accomplish this through studying and hard work
1005500 case western reserve from the beginning was my top choice for graduate school
1005501 i felt as if the m b a program was well established and would be beneficial to my career
1005502 i am proud to represent case western reserve university and to receive an award in recognition for the hard work i have done for masea i consider the association extremely valuable for student employment professionals being a member has enabled me to incorporate best practices learned through networking with other institutions
1005503 the office of student employment continually strives to provide excellent customer service to our students and campus supervisors here at case and my networking with other masea colleagues has provided me with the tools to achieve this goal
1005504 the staff of the office of university financial aid is very happy for and proud of susan we know how deserving she is of this outstanding service award she exhibits the same dedication and leadership in her role at case western reserve university on a daily basis as she has as treasurer of masea
1005505 we have formed a team of experienced outstanding researchers who have been working on this problem and meeting in cleveland regularly to share their results for the past four years
1005506 it is very gratifying to receive the nihs support for this very important work abnormally high levels of immune activation were described in the first reports of aids in 1981

1005514 i appreciate marks confidence in me and with his guidance intend to make a positive contribution in growing the research enterprise at case
1005515 in a macro sense its all about providing leadership of people and resources toward specific goals
1005516 sponsored research and the commercialization of the results of that research are mutually supported disciplines
1005517 by looking at ways to improve our business processes in research administration and reducing the barriers to interdisciplinary research we can achieve more and greater accomplishments

1005529 we have 30 per cent drugs out of stocks the important items of leading companies that are fastest running brands are out of market

1005532 street trees were associated with a lower prevalence of early childhood asthmas
1005533 there may be something else healthful about the areas that had more trees for example trees could be more abundant in areas that are well maintained in other ways
1005534 but the no 1 reason for it was about helping to preserve water quality in this area
1005535 besides beautifying our homes and communities trees are natural air conditioners and energy savers simply by following a few basic tree planting rules you can save energy and money on utility bills
1005536 the forest department gave the permission and asked us to pay rs 50 per tree that would be cut down as per their instructions the ghmc paid the amount
1005537 the us consulate authorities had proposed to widen the road by five feet we had to take the forest departments permission as it had planted these 32 trees covering the entire stretch from paigah palace to the main road
1005538 i played marbles with my friends under this banyan tree it is sad that the 200 year old tree is no more

1005541 no one can deny that forest exploitation is beneficial but it equally has an adverse effect on climate change if done irrationally
1005542 the total amount of forest that children can plant is very small but they can be associated with larger scale things so that children will be able to feel part of something much larger and they can see change
1005543 its got to be part of what children learn about now in the past it hasnt been ive been quite shocked that it hasnt been part of the curriculum

1005545 we cant have acquittals weve been holding these guys for years how can we explain acquittals we have to have convictions
1005546 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight
1005547 this move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead it is about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1005548 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
1005549 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice
1005550 the department of health admits in its guidance that bmi is the best and most practical way to assess whether a child is overweight or obese but then denies parents the actual figures for their children because they say it could be confusing for some
1005551 some parents may find the bmi growth charts confusing and may need someone to explain what they show
1005552 we want parents to easily understand the results without the need for further explanation and that is why the sliding scale bar will be used
1005553 parents need to be educated about the dangers of obesity and obesity related conditions such as type 2 diabetes
1005554 ten years ago type 2 diabetes in children was unheard of in the uk now we have over 1 000 children with the condition some as young as seven

1005579 for the first three weeks of the campaign however only the powerful eyes of osiris will actually be able to spot the asteroid which will look only like a dot in the sky
1005580 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
1005581 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1005582 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september
1005583 but osiris will also take this opportunity to obtain light curves of steins light curves tell us how the asteroid brightness varies with time providing us with additional preparatory information about the asteroid such as better knowledge of its shape and rotation characteristics
1005584 the selection of lockheed martin and thales alenia space is a major milestone for us
1005585 this program reflects our commitment to the expansion of our amazing and very unique network and to making our services even more powerful and cost effective for our customers as we replace our technical marvel of a network with an even more powerful one
1005586 we are extremely impressed with our finalists technical and creative design recommendations as well as with their ideas for important enhancements to our existing service offerings
1005587 both are identifying ways of meeting our iridium next requirements using advanced technology concepts these concepts will help us realize cost effective ways of providing enhanced products services and capabilities for our current customers as well as for those new customers we plan to serve in the future and the finalists are showing us they know how to do it in an affordable way

1005651 why is barack obama not 15 points ahead the way the democratic party is 15 points ahead
1005652 if obama is president will we still call it the white house
1005653 hes black and that makes him different and is he really one of the good black people
1005654 it is not to barack obamas advantage to make this a big issue
1005655 it is simply not acceptable to the majority of people including many of those who may be sympathetic
1005656 one of obamas big problems is that hes black and he does have a funny name
1005657 ever since obama declared his candidacy the question overhanging this election is whether america is ready to elect its first black president its a simple and straightforward question
1005658 i think we have demonstrated that you can actually vaccinate a country thats pretty dramatic stuff

1005671 congressman bartlett immediately acknowledged and regrets that he made several mistakes concerning three properties in his congressional financial disclosure statement
1005672 in order to answer unsupported insinuations by the frederick news post that those mistakes by congressman bartlett indicated that he was hiding capital gains profits from the voters congressman bartlett hired well respected frederick certified public accountant cpa mr john f dallavalle to review his financial records concerning the properties
1005673 the total records were reviewed by the cpa congressman bartlett filed an amended congressional financial disclosure statement to correct mistakes on his congressional financial disclosure statement no capital gains were made and therefore there were none to be reported concerning these three properties in his congressional financial disclosure statement
1005674 we have reviewed the records surrounding the acquisition remodeling and sale of these three properties
1005675 each of these properties entailed significant construction which took place over a number of years it is clear from the cost records that you lost money in the aggregate from the sale of these three properties
1005676 because 2 or 3 houses were being worked on simultaneously and workmen and materials went back and forth it was not possible for us to make accurate allocation of costs to specific houses
1005677 to claim accuracy as to the job would be inappropriate
1005678 its a pretty straightforward task you look at whats in the statute and condense it down to a question

1005687 itll take an underutilized piece of real estate in the central core put about 2 000 workers on that space and then put restaurant and retail space around that as well

1005689 so there will be five levels of below grade parking all to serve the retail and office thats there

1005691 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
1005692 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
1005693 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
1005694 the late paleozoic tropical climate was not buffered against cold from the high latitudes as everyone had thought
1005695 the evidence we found indicates that glaciers were common at this time even in tropical latitudes this calls into question traditional assumptions of long lasting equatorial warmth in the late paleozoic and raises the possibility of large scale and unexpected climate change in the tropics during that time
1005696 really prime names are losing value i think the domainer to domainer transactions are drying up a little as weve seen at auctions but that doesnt mean the names are any less valuable does it
1005697 tim is well experienced in the domain space and comes with a lot of knowledge and skills in dealing with domain monetization and acquisitions
1005698 it is certainly not painless for either side it is all in all only acceptable in view of the duration of the settlement and the performance related one off payment it is imperative however that the increased costs be compensated by higher productivity resolution of the pay dispute on their own initiative by lufthansa and ver di is an important message to our customers as well as our staff and to germany as an economic base we will go to every length to resume flight operations quickly for our customers in the customary reliability and quality
1005699 the discovery has enormous implications for the large scale deployment of solar since it puts us on the doorstep of a cheap and easily manufactured storage mechanism
1005700 the ease of implementation means that this discovery will have legs i have great faith in my chemistry materials science and engineering colleagues in the community to drive this discovery hard and hopefully their work along with our continued studies will yield viable technologies within 10 years
1005701 this study demonstrates how research is critical for driving american competitiveness in the global energy marketplace by funding fundamental research in water and renewable energy we are investing in both our economic and environmental futures
1005702 using common and affordable elements and a glass of water these chemists may have given us a future way to efficiently obtain oxygen by splitting water
1005703 when we support fundamental research we never know where that investment will lead in this instance it may lead to new opportunities for sustainable energy
1005704 the main objective there is the pursuit of al qaida to remove them from their hideouts there and continue to keep them off balance
1005705 mosul is a piece of valuable real estate for al qaida
1005706 they want to hold on to mosul because its their entryway to syria and it facilitates a lot of the flow of foreign fighters and money to finance al qaida
1005707 in anbar theres still a viable lethal al qaida threat
1005708 and that is really the focus of the security forces out there
1005709 thats a key security issue that we cant take our eye off and that we have got to continue to focus on another one would be the structured continued process of turning over security for provinces to the iraqi government that would be a good thing to watch and were making good progress on that
1005710 five hundred and sixty five voter registration centers are open people are registering to vote
1005711 i am very encouraged by the fact that speaker mashadani has called them in
1005712 theyre going to wrestle with it on sunday all parties really i think have an interest in solving this now because as they move forward with the elections and as they move forward with solving the kirkuk issue its going to be very beneficial to the country in terms of moving forward economic development
1005713 the people are by and large rejecting the violence whether its al qaida or iranian backed special groups this indiscriminate violence thats killing innocent iraqis
1005714 the iraqis have really out of hand rejected that and are not supporting any elements that really participated in that
1005715 its very encouraging time now that were kind of shifting into the political and economical development phase of the counterinsurgency

1005724 iraq and afghanistan remind us that military success alone is insufficient to achieve victory
1005725 we must not forget our hard learned lessons or allow the important soft power capabilities developed because of them to atrophy or even disappear
1005726 a whole of government approach is only possible when every government department and agency understands the core competencies roles missions and capabilities of its partners and works together to achieve common goals
1005727 from our point of view such an agenda would be counterproductive wasteful and dysfunctional
1005728 it would send exactly the wrong message to those nations who are striving to build democracies with civilian oversight and to be able to partner with us
1005729 far too often we find our military assuming missions for which its not best placed
1005730 and while weve filled these gaps admirably i believe theres no substitute for civilian expertise and experience whether its building schools advising city councils or engaging in other activities in complex operational environments
1005731 broadly speaking when it comes to americas engagement with the rest of the world it is important that the military is and is clearly seen to be in a supporting role to civilian agencies
1005732 is to adapt to new realities while preserving those core competencies and institutional traits that have made them so successful in the past

1005738 perhaps a starting point is a draft point in the codes for governing how the media represent climate change and a method for enforcing that code and that code needs to extend out to cover new media including blogs and perhaps taking a lesson from the obama campaigns micro response strategy a team empowered with responding to complaints specifically dealing with online inaccuracy to which all press and blogs have to respond
1005739 whatever happened to a bill that would make children in ohio wear helmets while riding their bikes
1005740 the law proposed last year by state rep michael skindell a lakewood democrat has not gone to vote but skindell is trying to build support for it if passed it would require children under 18 to wear a helmet when riding a bicycle police would first give warnings but would cite repeat offenders whose parents would have to pay a 25 fine the measure was introduced by a dayton area state senator but skindell introduced it in the house he considers it an important matter of child safety that could prevent head injuries an avid cyclist skindell pushed the bill after having a bad accident himself a little more than a year ago skindell said that while riding on lake avenue in cleveland near west 117th street he was cut off by a car and his bicycle hit it he said he struck his head on the car roof and again on the pavement and would have been killed if he had not been wearing a helmet he said he is still recovering from a fractured collarbone and has just started riding again on safe trails skindell said the bill has the support of pediatric groups and an association of ohio childrens hospitals including rainbow babies amp childrens in cleveland the bill had a hearing in the spring skindell said he hopes the bill will pass next year

1005972 meltdown the inside story of the north korean nuclear crisis

1006140 this record felt like and still feels like from the writing to the recording a reclaiming of my own independence
1006141 you begin to get yourself hung up on other peoples expectations and i dont think i do my best work when i think about what other people might think of the work im doing when you do that i think the process is robbed of its freedom a little bit so i kind of found my way to an independent streak on this record i was making the songs for the songs themselves and for me alone i never played them for anyone else and i didnt obsess about them too much id write a song and move on so theres a truthful feeling to the album
1006142 when i make a record i finish it and i sit with it for a little while and inevitably ill write a couple more songs and its happened just about every time those other songs really shape the record and almost every time theyve had the title track of the record
1006143 to me its a rock record in the vein of people that ive always loved like weezer or the pixies but i guess those bands have great pop sensibilities but to me i view them as rock bands
1006144 if rock is popular at the time it becomes pop and i embrace pop music but it doesnt sound poppier to me so i just dont know if it is or it isnt ill take it if it is though because i think people enjoy that
1006145 hes a fine producer in his own right and id never worked with a producer who had written their own songs and had success with them
1006146 so i thought that that gave him a unique perspective on what i was doing and i thought he might work as a good sounding board for the songs ive got he taught me a lot because he has a great sense of melody
1006147 im writing about the journey i have been on and my life has taken me in some weird directions
1006148 some have been great some have been hard and i looked to those things and to the people that surround me and have drawn stories out of those experiences thats the one thing when you write about what you know as long as you keep living your life you dont run out of creative impetus
1006149 you can see the similarities between a band about to go on stage and a team about to walk on the pitch

1006151 his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
1006152 he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before
1006153 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
1006154 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1006155 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1006156 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1006157 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1006158 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1006159 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
1006160 you dont really believe in the concept of personal space do you
1006161 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
1006162 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
1006163 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
1006164 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
1006165 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
1006166 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
1006167 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
1006168 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
1006169 if i wanted to i could go that route and be respected not for my success respected for my music and my lyrics or whatever
1006170 i did a mixtape called teen of the south with dj scream and i did that just to step my game up a little bit on that lyrical side but i wasnt really going into no album and just full fledge trying to switch my swagger and try to get respect from the game cause why would i show love to the game the game dont show you love back so i wasnt gonna do that and come back out and mess up my image and mess up myself i was going on the strength that i want respect from people who probably dont like me anyway so im gonna stick to what i do and stay being successful and ill do some mixtapes and some futures something like that
1006171 polow da don did the beat thats all ill say polow did the beat i aint saying whos featured on it or nothing like that im just saying when it comes out we aint doing no leaks we aint doing nothing when it comes out straight video straight radio all in the same day
1006172 im from south atlanta shawty lo from west atlanta gucci mane is from east atlanta and basically you know its swagger its all about your swag dudes going louis dudes going gucci dudes going prada so i was like let me go gucci real quick we hooked up went into the studio knocked the song out and basically its like three 12 bar verses we just spittin about how swagged out we are basically just a swag record i went in i did the beat
1006173 that was gonna be my first single leading into my second album
1006174 it was a hot record three million views on youtube two million plays all that but i didnt wanna go back that route no more like i was already successful with a big dance song this record was incorporated with a dance it was another big dance and it was about to take over again i told the record company i was like stop i dont wanna come back dancing cause the question that everybodys asking is like what am i gonna come back with so i could have took back over with that record but i think dancing is starting to get a little corny so i was like man im gonna hold off on that tip so i just threw it on the mixtape its heavy in the streets we gonna shoot an underground video to it
1006175 basically the record is just talking about the fact that im successful in the industry so i got a lot of cheese
1006176 i made 6 mil at 16 so basically im just saying im on a shopping spree just talking cash money thats all
1006177 i went to barack obamas office right before he started running for president
1006178 so you know we went in and talked and everything people were wondering what we talked about it was confidential but i was a firm supporter of barack even before he decided to run for the presidency so im all for it man were making history and were still going strong so make sure you vote obama believe that 08
1006179 its great i want it back i want the records back
1006180 he has the music its right there in the computer
1006181 i stop by his studio every time and get something that adds something significant to my project each time im about to put a record out and i spend three or four days there to me hes the best producer in the game
1006182 when i walk in the studio i record the first beat that comes on regardless if i think its a hit record or not
1006183 we get in work mode get comfortable and go through the material thats in the computer dre always has hit records sometimes artists that need producers they need someone to create a direction for them musically i need the jewels hes just got laying around he dont gotta tell me what to do with it all he has to do is say track six or go to track eight hell have hits playing there you just have to get in and get them
1006184 im waiting for the detox all i can say is dr dre is the best producer in my eyes just the consistency over the years he knows what he wants hes such a perfectionist that it becomes difficult for him to put it out
1006185 when we came out i can say it now i actually hated puff daddy
1006186 i can say that now cause puff is my man i was disgusted at what they was doing with the shiny suits and the blow up dolls and looking like missy i didnt agree with that i felt the shiny suit movement was destroying the grimy movement as i got older i learned to respect people for doing different things at that time pone was actually locked up i was on the streets and i would turn on bet and mtv it would be the shiny suit dudes it was a messed up time mase was killing them
1006187 yall can say what yall wanna say about mase but he was killin them you almost wanted to throw on something shiny they caught remember jay with the sunshine video he had the ferris wheel the cyclone whatever it was real hard
1006188 first time its just mobb deep and cnn capone n noreaga
1006189 we got prodigy we got him in jail on the phone call we got him before jail after jail thats it we dont know the name of it
1006190 we letting them know we relevant we survived the storm
1006191 nothings changed we always gonna be relevant as long as good music is relevant
1006192 people think capone and nore we havent lived in the hood for the past 12 years so they think we may be in hollywood or la la land the record is basically nore telling me i never should have went there but i had to do it hollywood is not hollywood as you know it though
1006193 yo can i take it back to where it all started
1006194 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight
1006195 this performance is for my mama the woman who drove me to chicago at the age of 3 and said baby
1006196 we want to demonstrate that you can have a high profile job and you can live in a functional space with zero carbon emissions

1006261 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it
1006262 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
1006263 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
1006264 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
1006265 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
1006266 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you
1006267 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
1006268 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist
1006269 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
1006270 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold
1006271 every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy
1006272 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
1006273 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
1006274 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought
1006275 it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
1006276 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
1006277 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
1006278 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
1006279 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
1006280 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
1006281 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelt the professors brain
1006282 so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
1006283 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
1006284 a meeting to finalise all outstanding issues will take place on august 13

1006291 north korea was so close to my mothers heart and she often told us about her experiences going to school in pyongyang
1006292 president kim pointed outside and said that just as the long korean winter was about to give way to the warmth of spring so he hoped that the relations between our two countries would soon move away from the coldness of winter and into the warmth of spring
1006293 in the years following the late president kims statement to my father many people in my own country doubted if it would ever happen but because of recent events we can truly say that a new springtime has arrived in the relationship between my country and the democratic peoples republic of korea

1006312 urban living is kinder to the environment than the suburban lifestyle
1006313 a manhattanites carbon footprint is 30 percent smaller than the average americans
1006314 we recognize that all human beings have the right to the preservation of life religion property intellect and dignity no muslim or christian should deny the other these rights nor should they tolerate the denigration or desecration of one anothers sacred symbols founding figures or places of worship
1006315 these were religious people they werent interested in diluting their faiths
1006316 and in that a type of sincerity emerged that was perhaps the greatest benefit of the initiative
1006317 muslims feel they have been stereotyped and stigmatized in the media as evangelical christians we feel the same stereotyping
1006318 we are a diverse community of christians yet we are often portrayed through the media as being tied to one political agenda one view of eschatology and intolerant of all others
1006319 loving god and neighbor together a christian response to a common word between us and you
1006320 we hope to point out the true solution to the moslem problem namely the evangelization of moslems and to awaken sympathy love and prayer on behalf of the moslem world until its bonds are burst its wounds are healed its sorrows removed and its desires satisfied in jesus christ
1006321 the missionaries that we sent were coming home saying muslims already believe in god what we need is dialogue between muslims and christians
1006322 in the name of god the compassionate the merciful and may peace and blessings be upon the prophet muhammad
1006323 there is no god but god muhammad is the messenger of god

1006325 and he is the oft forgiving full of loving kindness al wadud
1006326 they have taken their learned men and their rabbis as lords besides allaah and also the messiah the son of mary but they were not commanded except to worship allaah alone none has the right to be worshipped except him how free and far removed is allaah fron the partners they associate with him
1006327 so if it is said to you who is your lord
1006328 the fact that women agreed to it and are paid is about as convincing as the fact that we should be in favor of sweatshops in china where woman are locked into the factory and work fifteen hours a day and then the factory burns down and they all die they were paid and they consented but it doesnt make me in favor of it

1006340 tub and tile cleaner everyone loved the smell its not too overpowering for pregnant noses either didnt tackle soap scum as some would have hoped but did make the tile shine our moms liked the snazzy bottle design and shape overall not earth shattering but pleasing to the senses lil bowl blu toilet cleaner this product worked wonders in the bowl toilets around america will never be the same the shape of the bottle made for easy application overall a move to the front of the class glass cleaner our moms appreciated the lack of streaks and the minty scent that can rarely be found in glass cleaners this product did the job all while being cute and simple to use overall average performance but the scent left an overachievers impression all purpose cleaner our panel was divided on this topic some of the nozzles dripped all over hands creating not so happy mothers everyone agreed that the scent is delicious but not when its worn as perfume the product seems to get the job done but some wondered if pink grapefruit smell was being spread all over their countertops in lieu of actual cleaning power overall pretty but a bit of a slacker

1006346 it is easy to obtain confirmations or verifications for nearly every theory if we look for confirmations
1006347 every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it or to refute it testability is falsifiability confirming evidence should not count except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory

1006394 we respect the criticism of our plan to change the public education of english
1006395 but our goal is to get rid of goose daddies and unless we settle the problems in public education we cant do anything about private education
1006396 did not want to see any increase in goose daddies and family separations just for the sake of learning english
1006397 we have to change the structure of the english education we have now so that koreans will no longer be afraid to face a foreigner who speaks english
1006398 if you look at reality it is very hard for teachers to speak in english in just two years
1006399 i think it should be the english teachers who get private tutoring first
1006400 it may be hard and cost a lot but this change is needed
1006401 i want to create a system so that our children will be able to go to college without using english tutors or studying abroad at an early age

1006437 optical techniques such as fluorescent probes can identify and localize features of interest in biological specimens with extremely high sensitivity and specificity but optical microscopy cannot resolve the features structure
1006438 the solution we are developing will allow researchers to use optical techniques to identify targets then transfer the sample and grid coordinates to a tem and automatically navigate to those targets to obtain high resolution images maintaining the sample in a frozen hydrated state throughout the entire process
1006439 tem can provide two dimensional images and three dimensional reconstructions of biological materials with nanometer scale resolution sufficient to resolve the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins and essential features of other macromolecules and molecular complexes
1006440 however without the localization provided by optical techniques finding those molecules is extremely difficult think of it as trying to find a particular string of glass beads in a barrel full of beads with correlative microscopy you can use techniques such as fluorescent markers to light up the string you are interested in and then go back to the same location for a closer look with the tem
1006441 we believe that the guidance we receive from user participants in this innovative development program will significantly enhance the practical value of future correlative microscopy solutions our collaborative approach with mpi of biochemistry and individual researchers demonstrates the importance fei places on interaction with leaders in the field in the design of new products and methods

1006443 in a few short weeks dailymed tm is already making a positive impact and allowing hoosiers to not only better manage their health needs but lead healthier more productive lives
1006444 our pharmacists are working directly with patients physicians nurses and caregivers to evaluate each patients prescriptions vitamins and otc medicine regimen by doing so our clinical team is making upwards of three recommendations per enrolled member covering such items as medication changes dosing changes and improved medication administration time
1006445 on average we spend about one hour on the initial consultation it is not uncommon for us to encounter patients who take 20 or more pills per day and who may see four or more physicians specialists
1006446 these types of patients are highly susceptible to adverse drug events dailymed tm can help avoid those events unnecessary hospitalizations improve pharmaceutical care maximize efficacy and save state taxpayers hundreds and possibly thousands of dollars per enrolled member
1006447 when we launched care select in november 2007 our emphasis was on coordination and improved primary care delivery leading to better medication adherence while decreasing unnecessary emergency room usage hospitalizations and institutional placement
1006448 dailymed tm is an option the care management team is accessing in order to make this improved care possible
1006449 july has been a busy month for our care managers as they have focused most all of their time and energy into getting the final 20 000 members enrolled into the advantage health solutions and mdwise programs
1006450 as we quickly move past the initial roll out with careselect members statewide we are transitioning to more active management and expect to see many more members benefiting from improved pharmaceutical management with dailymed tm starting in august 2008 by doing so we continue to believe this will provide significant value for the members as they will ultimately have access to better and more cost effective pharmaceutical care

1006483 the good thing about moving to portland will be having everyone in the minors on the same program
1006484 the last few years have been hard for us to grow our players with the half and half arrangement with the
1006485 we havent brought marek up yet for a couple of reasons
1006486 when we needed a fourth line guy we brought up clarke macarthur there werent too many offensive call ups marek is a young kid who still could have been playing juniors the year before last
1006487 we want to see some growth in his quickness and battling skills and were expecting this year to be a good turnaround season for him he has to be a key guy for us in portland it would be great if he is the first guy called up this season
1006488 nathan had a really good camp and he played just like he plays in his college games
1006489 you cant help but notice him hes always around the puck creating offense he pulls things out of his hat sometimes and he fit in really well
1006490 hes successful because he is quick and there is a ton of battler in him hes a smaller version of brian gionta gionta has that quickness too gerbe has slippery quickness and competes for pucks he doesnt like to lose i find it hard to believe an inch or two will make that much difference if a guy has the heart twice the size of someone else nathan should do all right
1006491 ennis is in the gerbe mold a creative offensive player
1006492 he played pretty well here at development camp and he handles himself really well he has a composure to him his junior coach spoke highly of him hes kind of small but hell get bigger and stronger hes bigger than gerbe
1006493 there will probably be a transition for him to go from defenseman to forward thats our thought process right now
1006494 he played forward last season for half the year and ran the power play from the point in the american league hes got the capability of doing that this way we get the offensive mentality of a forward at the point and he has more defensive background than the average forward at the point
1006495 his issue is his skating his gift is his big shot
1006496 mark is probably going to get another chance to see where he fits in in the nhl there arent too many guys can shoot a puck like him he needs to work on his foot speed especially the first couple of steps
1006497 hes not going to be the guy that carries the puck hell be more like a dave andreychuk who goes to the net gets the puck and pounds it into the net mark is a hybrid guy who played defense in juniors and some forward hes a guy who can score and get the puck to the net then somehow they get through the goalie
1006498 for a kid that tall he has good feet and hands you dont see that all the time this is a guy who is 6 foot 7 but it so coordinated that he can really motor
1006499 hes the complete pro from his work ethic to his desire to be an nhl player he will be there mike is a tough guy to play against and he has a great desire to succeed and achieve
1006500 in a way its not surprising because he lives with the ott family in windsor ontario and he has great respect for dallas forward steve ott and steves dad he also had a lot of respect for his junior coaches in windsor when we drafted him we were told he has a burning desire to play in the nhl and we have seen nothing to make us disagree with that statement
1006501 hes an offensive defenseman who flew onto the charts this year
1006502 he has to become like a lot of kids going from juniors to the professional game he thinks offense but you have to be capable defensively hopefully his skating agility and his defensive awareness will improve he needs to work on his pivoting his turning to skate backwards his first couple of steps anyone can skate a straight line todays game is about wiggling around making tight turns skating in a phone booth you have to be able to maneuver get a little space and throw a puck on net
1006503 chris is another guy that is going to play in the nhl
1006504 we expect great things he has speed power and awareness chris thinks like a defenseman and he has a good skill set hes a lot like his former denver university teammate matt carle hes in great shape hes a great physical fitness guy with very little body fat at 198 pounds
1006505 this is his third development camp with us and he has always been very athletic his quickness and power rank at the top of our list we cant ask for much more than that
1006506 mike has to get stronger and he has to work on his mobility
1006507 mike has a long reach long arms and a long stick he needs to learn how to tangle guys up without getting penalties like a lot of young guys he has to learn the percentages when to make a certain play at a certain time
1006508 dennis is a good skater and passer but hes another guy who has to get stronger to play in the nhl
1006509 although he was used as power play guy in juniors we look at him not as guy who runs it but as the defenseman on the other side from the power play quarterback he has a big shot a really good one timer hes not the guy who deceives and moves the puck but hes good as the other point on the power play because he has defensive and offensive skills
1006510 jhonas signed a three year entry level contract with us in may and we are expecting him to be with our ahl team in portland this year
1006511 jhonas is a technique goaltender versus a blocker type hes smaller sized but his numbers and experiences at his age are equal to a henrik lundqvist jhonas has achieved what lundqvist did at his age and they have very similar numbers that would be great if he is comparable to lundqvist
1006512 he doesnt get rattled i saw him in sweden in pressure games and he handles things with ease it seems he has that poise and composure that you want in your goalie and he is mature beyond his years thats another good trait for a goaltender a lot of them dont play that well until they are 30
1006513 this is such a mentally tough game that a lot of young goalies are not ready for it
1006514 kashis goal is to make it simple and delicious for people to enjoy foods that provide positive nutrition with a great tasting whole grain eating experience

1006516 the hearty whole grains and delicious flavor combinations are guaranteed to satisfy all taste buds
1006517 kashi seven whole grain pilaf sides epitomize the kashi mission to combine excellent nourishment with flavorful ingredients and simple preparation in every new food we create

1006659 het is niet zo dat je maar n keer deze tags moet ingeven net als de inhoud van je webpaginas moet ook de inhoud van je metatags evolueren
1006660 zoekrobotten kijken ook na hoeveel keer er van hun paginas uit naar je site wordt gelinkt krijg je veel hyperlinks van andere sites dan meent de robot dat je site interessanter is en dus een betere plaats verdient uit ons onderzoek blijkt dat slechts 10 procent van de onderzochte sites op meer dan vijftig links kan rekenen de meerderheid heeft vijf hyperlinks of minder
1006661 maar ook hoeveel maal op je site wordt geklikt en hoe lang mensen op je site blijven rondhangen heeft zijn invloed
1006662 belangrijk is dat er achter de website een propere html code zit sites met een slordige code worden zelden geregistreerd sites die met programmas als frontpage worden gemaakt cre ren een hoop overtollige codes en worden dus geweigerd ook bij paginas die gemaakt zijn in flash is er vaak een probleem je maakt dus best een webpagina een sitemap waar de zoekrobot een duidelijke html code kan terugvinden

1006749 evidence of a possible break in was reported to the police on monday morning
1006750 however the extent of the break in isnt clear nor is the reason behind it
1006751 if i really wanted that thing how could i afford it
1006752 i am abundant i am prosperous i am good at managing my money money flows to me i make good business decisions
1006753 i like to wear vintage designer clothes you can never go wrong with that
1006754 at the moment im wearing vintage chanel and i also like vintage gucci especially little handbags that are battered and have been around for 40 years
1006755 i love wearing things that have been around longer than i have and seen more than me
1006756 i like getting home after a days work taking everything off slipping into my bathrobe pouring a glass of red wine having the radio on in the background then calling my friends and family and gassing on the phone all night
1006757 eindelijk komen ze die modderpoel voor mijn brievenbus dichtgooiten met een extra laag grond
1006758 our products have a ph of 5 5 that matches the ph value of the skin and are never tested on animals reinstating yet again that beauty is after all in our hands for skin the way its meant to be
1006759 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
1006760 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
1006761 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
1006762 president calderons repeal of the requirement that drug companies have manufacturing plants in mexico in order for any company to import use or sell generic copies of drugs is tremendous news for mexicans in desperate need of access to lifesaving medications for hiv aids and other diseases
1006763 i believe president calderons actions earlier today came in no small measure thanks to the ongoing advocacy efforts of a growing group of dedicated activists in mexico who have been pushing the government and industry on this issue we salute president calderon for his forward thinking action which should dramatically improve and save the lives of countless mexicans it was the right thing for president calderon to do with or without the pressure from activists he did it and we thank him for overturning this outdated requirement
1006764 its clear from research weve done that parents want to know their childs results and whether there is a concern about their health but they want clear information which is helpful and non stigmatising
1006765 today weve published guidance which will help pcts deliver this programme and help to make sure parents get the information they need about their childs results in ways that they have said will be most helpful
1006766 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1006767 schools are well placed to make a real difference in tackling obesity with record investment in sport and exercise encouraging active travel to and from home making cooking compulsory in secondary schools scrapping junk food and transforming the quality of school lunches
1006768 but at the end of the day parents bring up children not the government schools or health services every parent wants their child to be fit and healthy so its only right to help them make informed decisions about their lives
1006769 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
1006770 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
1006771 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
1006772 circumcision is the only new hiv prevention method to demonstrate consistent efficacy in randomized controlled trials
1006773 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
1006774 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
1006775 even non physician health care providers will be able to learn this procedure to safely perform circumcisions in resource poor regions

1006780 i think the organization was put in a tough spot it was a difficult position when brett decided to change his mind but well welcome him back and move forward as a team
1006781 im a football player and ive got to focus on the things i can control and thats playing football with him coming back and if they do open it up to a competition i get a chance to compete and thats all i can ask for
1006782 i think the guys in the locker room and i have grown a lot closer thats only going to help me hopefully ill be the guy this year but i know im going to get a chance to lead this team and youre going to have to pry it out of my fingers this year
1006783 thats really all you can do is open it up hes reinstated so at that point once they did that youve got to give him a chance to win the job its only fair so i guess well see what happens
1006784 theres been no promises once again theres been indecision throughout bretts path back here in green bay its important for us to sit down communicate theres some things we need to go through once again the information comes out of that conversation will be used to move forward and a decision we will make for the football team
1006785 what i was seeing was that a lot of our senior citizens were living in squaled not a lot but there was few living in squaled conditions that didnt have access to resources in the community
1006786 i believe the victimization of our senior citizens is vastly under reported for a number a reasons we wont necessarily get into but its vastly under reported in our community and were all going to be senior citizens one day and so you know beside again like i say children i feel they are one population group that needs to be protected
1006787 it is also decided that if the government moves with the ipo proposal the entire bsnl workforce of three lakh will get into direct action including indefinite strike
1006788 we dont plan to enter the pay per view segment where apple amazon sony and others focus or the ad supported segment where hulu youtube and others compete

1006794 id love a holiday but im not going anywhere this year yes thats right the dream destroyer phrase itself a holiday ive got no money
1006795 i know you cant go on holiday or you think you cant but if you could just suppose for a moment it was possible where would you go

1006797 who do you know who has got a villa or a house in france that you could rent or you could stay there who do you know who has got a timeshare you could use who do you know who is a travel agent and could get you a cheap flight ad holiday deal who do you know who is french or has french family or who teaches language classes who do you know who sells timeshare and you could got to one of their presentations and get some free vouchers
1006798 yes i know someone with a timeshare but it is in spain or it is probably too late to exchange it yes i know someone with a house but i dont know when they are using it or if they rent it out dont know anybody who
1006799 i cant but i dont know or that wouldnt work for me because
1006800 i know you dont know and if you did know what might you do
1006801 try again draw a long breath and shut your eyes

1006805 what is the best course of action for you at this moment
1006806 professor myers hatred for the catholic faith and the eucharist in particular is a clear symptom of the culture of death that allows nothing sacred even the body of christ
1006807 i pierced it the host with a rusty nail i hope jesus tetanus shots are up to date and then i simply threw it in the trash followed by the classic decorative items of trash cans everywhere old coffee grounds and a banana peel
1006808 bearing in mind that his actions reveal the deep hatred espoused by many secular humanists for the culture of life
1006809 we pray that god forgives professor myers and shows him the light of the catholic faith

1006816 we must leave the small considerations aside and create unity both inwardly and outwardly
1006817 i believe that the internal divisions we have become accustomed to and the idea that different parties have such extremely different ideologies and agendas is a thing of the past and is no longer the case there is a common agenda that every party can put forward on political issues and also on dealing with the threats we face
1006818 kadima is a party of failures we must let the public choose particularly at such a critical juncture we need to let the people decide who will lead them

1006837 the next test of will between the white house and the democrats comes in january over revisions to the foreign intelligence surveillance act the sticking point has been the democrats stance against bushs proposal to prevent lawsuits against telecommunications utilities that aided eavesdropping by counterterrorism agents they argue the firms violated americans privacy and should be sued but look at it this way suppose the police show up at your door and tell you that they have suspicions that your new neighbor is doing something unlawful you let the cops use your den window to watch the neighbors house for several days no charges follow but months later the neighbor sues you i suspect youd be pretty outraged by being dragged into court over doing your civic duty and complying with a police request thats the situation facing the telcoms

1006861 i think that building the space station is far more difficult and certainly far more complex than was executing apollo apollo was an incredible leap from where we were but it was simpler than what we are trying to do today

1006863 well building the space station is like building the worlds newest and highest bridge except people cant drive across it
1006864 the only way you can see it is in the photos we bring back or the tv images we send what we are building here is larger than a football field and were doing it in zero gravity whats happening here is extraordinary i mean you need to be able to appreciate it and its way beyond anything that has ever been done by human beings before anywhere

1006866 but i also would say to you that i think at the moment that just as

1007000 jugamos ante el campe n y en su casa tengo que ser sincero santos nos super aunque nosotros en ocasiones fuimos mejores el empate me deja contento pero m s me hubiera gustado ganar y estoy seguro que a santos tambi n
1007001 se puede decir que su desempe o ha sido bueno lleva dos goles en dos partidos pero esto apenas empieza faltan 15 jornadas y espero que siga as porque he visto muchos casos de jugadores que en similares condiciones fracasan y despu s van a otros equipos y son grandes figuras
1007002 pienso que el triunfo fue justo aunque repito me hubiera gustado ganar habr que esperar el punto de vista de daniel guzm n que tambi n ser interesante

1007010 i took my kindergarten quizzes and did great the teacher made me problem solve and ya know thats what i do as a super hero im nurturing a wiggly tooth up front so who knows next time you see me i might have a gappy mouth
1007011 our understanding with the us was good throughout and it never came to acrimony but they are the biggest subsidisers in the world in terms of what affects us so we will have to see them in court
1007012 i dont have any problem if they want to offer a partial deal that puts a cap on their subsidies
1007013 but countries want the power to say no to some things in order to get what they want i dont think partial deals work in a system like the wto
1007014 this was in slow motion and now it will be accelerated
1007015 this dollar weakness is somewhat offsetting the effect of the subprime effect at least for the us economy
1007016 and as long as the us economy continues to stay buoyant or at least resilient it will be good news for asia
1007017 the downside effect is that because of this currency appreciation nonetheless it has affected the competitiveness of asian exports to the west and to europe and to the us
1007018 it will be a very challenging environment for any risk taking especially for equity maybe to a lesser extent property
1007019 anything that is risk taking is going to be tough
1007020 in fact we are in an environment where there is a lot of unwinding a lot of de leveraging a lot of pulling back of risk taking in the system
1007021 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
1007022 at times he appeared to grow testy as he discussed his wifes failed bid for the nomination
1007023 interferes with the issue which is who should be elected in november
1007024 yes but not the ones you think and it would be counterproductive for me to talk about
1007025 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish i had said things i wish i hadnt said but i am not a racist ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
1007026 how working class blacks are struggling in this economy too
1007027 combines the power of celebrity and media with 21st century grassroots organizing tactics
1007028 so why cant obama close the deal why cant he get more than 50 in the polls
1007029 today represents a milestone in our nations efforts to remedy the ills of our past
1007030 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1007031 in america you are not playing the race card when you acknowledge a very visible fact
1007032 theyre only saying that to detract from the real issue
1007033 they want us to keep feeling guilty about past injustices
1007034 why should we be held accountable for what our ancestors did
1007035 the threats aint fazing us the nooses or the jokes so get off your ass black people its time to get out and vote
1007036 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
1007037 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1007038 i know jay z i know ludacris i know russell simmons
1007039 i know a bunch of these guys they are great talents and great businessmen which is something that doesnt get emphasized enough it would be nice if i could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying that they were getting bad images of themselves
1007040 so santa claus is safe for this year but he better start looking for some brand new real estate
1007041 the secret of our success is that the show was written for a smart audience
1007042 factories like ours couldnt get insured because we did not erect a proper wall ive tried but the insurance companies didnt accept my application
1007043 my losses are huge but what can i do everything has been destroyed now im hoping the landlord can give us some compensation this is an accident theres nothing we can do
1007044 my clothes my bag my passport were kept in the factory now its all gone i dont know what to do
1007045 i love being a ninja i find any stick that i can twirl around in my hand to nun chuck whatever enemy i might find on the couch im starting to draw characters and animals mama is very excited i dont do it when asked though im a great helper getting dishes for meals and clothes for eden i love to help
1007046 i love being a ninja i find any stick that i can twirl around in my hand to nun chuck whatever enemy i might find on the couch im starting to draw characters and animals mama is very excited i dont do it when asked though im a great helper getting dishes for meals and clothes for eden i love to help

1007050 the thing about last year was that although cristiano had a massive season it was the squads strength in depth that made the difference
1007051 its hard to pick individuals but for the players who have had a bedding in time and starting their second season like anderson nani carlos tevez and owen hargreaves theyll all be better for the experience
1007052 we had a situation where we had set aside this coming saturday for gareth barrys testimonial that obviously is in abeyance
1007053 mediaclubsouthafrica com will provide relevant mind opening up to date and verifiable information in the build up to 2010
1007054 we took this step because we recognise the importance of media local african and throughout the world in shaping perceptions of south africa and our continent
1007055 we are delighted with the overwhelming response to our call for volunteers it really shows that south africans are very supportive and willing to roll up their sleeves and get involved to ensure the success of the confederations cup and the 2010 fifa world cup
1007056 you know how tyra likes to do that stuff and shell get a lot of press off it
1007057 over a 5 month period may to september 2003 10 patients were seen by the fracture team at the royal cornwall hospitals nhs trust of the 10 eight were male with an average age 18 7 range 12 31 there was an equal incidence of left and right sided injuries all the injuries were closed with no neurovascular symptoms or signs eight were to the lower limb all of which were fractures of the distal tibia ankle and mid foot six patients required hospital admission all of these injuries were from skimboarding
1007058 there are no significant differences in the objective data from the technical studies to date focusing on football turf versus top quality natural grass
1007059 last year we went four times a week to the fitness centre at this stage of the season ive been there only three times in total this season
1007060 you hear people at feyenoord talking about all the exercises they do to gain strength were doing the exact opposite we re working with the ball all the time
1007061 last season we kept on pushing our opponents even on their own half we were very vulnerable on the counter attack with the current style not every counter is immediately dangerous
1007062 at this moment we need a number two goalkeeper and jan knows he is coming as a number two
1007063 i know jan very well and he had some problems when he was at fulham he was on his own because for some reason his family didnt come with him to england
1007064 he couldnt concentrate on his football properly but they will come with him this time i know him and i trust him im looking forward to working with him
1007065 ronaldinhos brazil enjoy themselves and others enjoy their football but i recall that this was also the case at the world cup
1007066 however in the end we italy were the team lifting the cup in berlin
1007067 we italy will not enjoy ourselves lets hope that brings us luck
1007068 we have a great team and after speaking with casiraghi i have a feeling that italy will go very far
1007069 were down to one forward at the moment with alan smith weve not risked anybody in our pre season games
1007070 but michael owen will be back soon and will probably come on for the final half hour of the valencia friendly
1007071 theres a lot of lads whove done a big shift this pre season geremi alan smith james milner danny guthrie steven taylor and claudio cacapa have all played a lot of football
1007072 thanks to carrizos arrival many things have improved but there will be no rivalry between us
1007073 i want to win the scudetto i hope that i can do that with the lazio shirt
1007074 against manchester united i played 45 minutes and we did not play together i want to dfo that though but it something for the coach to decide
1007075 in any case i think we will make a great partnership
1007076 i am a player that likes to have the ball and control it before looking for the best past for a team mate
1007077 nick jonas is my role model i think its cool how he can tell the world about his diabetes my dad had cancer and diabetes and he passed away last year its amazing how he can get through this with the help of his family

1007300 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1007301 the conference agreement provides for 14 6 billion in tax breaks and credits between 2005 and 2015 including 2 8 billion for fossil fuel production
1007302 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence
1007303 massive pork slabs dished out to the vested interests who needed them least
1007304 while it contains some useful provisions it also contains massive pork slabs dished out to the vested interests who need them least like oil companies and has no overarching strategy to deal with the new world
1007305 what is left is a candy store of tax breaks and subsidies for both the highly profitable oil and gas companies and the more struggling alternative energy producers it is a bill that only industry executives and lobbyists could love and even they dont want their names on it
1007306 meanwhile both houses conspired in some spectacular giveaways one would ease environmental restrictions on oil and gas companies drilling on public lands the other would shower billions in undeserved tax breaks on the same companies even as they wallow in the windfall profits produced by 60 a barrel oil
1007307 given how long congress labored over this legislation and how much negotiation was required to get it to this stage its hard not to be disappointed by a bill that in effect preserves the status quo
1007308 both are also laden with pork the senate version is a little less porky than the house measure but still contains lavish tax incentives that go primarily to the oil and gas industries despite an admonition by bush that tax breaks for oil companies are unnecessary in a time of high gas prices congress seems intent on giveaways the ideal fate for this energy bill like its predecessors is death by committee better no energy policy for another year than a sham
1007309 you know the energy bill that passed in 2005 was larded with all kinds of special interest breaks giveaways to the oil companies senator obama voted for it i did not because i knew that it was going to be an absolute nightmare now were all out on the campaign trail talking about taking the tax subsidies away from the oil companies some of which were in that 2005 energy bill
1007310 however i am disappointed that the bill provides nearly 6 billion in tax breaks for oil gas and coal and in addition provides tax credits for nuclear energy these tax breaks are provided despite the fact that president bush has repeatedly stated that we do not need tax breaks for the oil and gas industry given the high prices americans are experiencing
1007311 our nations energy crisis has reached historic levels we need policy whose boldness is commensurate with that crisis but thats not what were getting instead were getting a pork laden lobbyist driven dream bill its inexcusable
1007312 the congressional budget office cbo estimates that implementing the bill will cost 5 1 billion in 2006 and 35 9 billion over the 2006 2010 period i am concerned that this estimate does not include the at least 10 1 billion in unpaid for tax breaks the 10 1 billion includes 5 7 billion in production tax credits and 4 4 billion in various subsidies to the oil gas and nuclear industries
1007313 statement by u s senator barbara boxer on the energy bill
1007314 furthermore this bill awards multi million dollar tax breaks to those same companies which are reaping windfalls from record high oil prices at the expense of washington consumers to continue us down the path of fossil fuels which are a key contributor to climate change

1007318 i gathered a lot of data about the sensuality of living in this body its meant to be enjoyed food is a portal to joy its connected to community and health its so multifaceted i always knew food and how to feed myself and i grew up wanting to make things more beautiful when you have the experience of something that sustains you beyond just putting food in front of you you realize the different creative ways there are to eat and enjoy that experience we all have stories of favorite restaurants and meals and being around people and food that were beautiful and nourishing

1007320 chocolate is a forgivable sin no one questions whether or not you need it and its not going away
1007321 i realized i was trying to find my voice in fabric i started doing traditional pieces and taking classes and got the basics down it wasnt long before i came to a turning point i was at a job at central market id gone to a new years eve party and was asked to share best and worst moments of the past year i couldnt think of the best moment and thats unusual for me i get excited over belly button lint so i said thats it im going to create a studio and cut out the bullshit and quit the job and follow what has been calling me
1007322 my life became like the human experience of the perfect storm at the same time all this was coming together i connected with friends who wanted me to make something chocolate i whipped up this recipe that had been given to me by john henry faulks wife i completely bastardized it and made it my own doing the same thing to the recipe that i was doing with the quilts
1007323 i thought maybe its time if everythings going to change why not change everything its like trying to jump over the grand canyon you make the first step and the rest come after i recognized the mystery and beauty of chocolate which is an incredible tool to express so may emotions its such a mysterious food its so dynamic theres nothing static about it

1007327 i would say there are a couple of ways of following your bliss you can fling yourself off a cliff and as the wind rushes past wonder if your wings are opening or are you free falling the other way is to say i want to get from here to here theyre the same thing as long as youre holding to the vision that you want to get there there is a galaxy of ways to get there but if you let go of wanting to get there youre going to torture yourself its not going to go away

1007362 this quarter sigir produced two cumulative reviews of sigirs audits and inspections analyzing the 230 reports produced to date and deriving overarching themes the reports conclude with a series of lessons learned that supplement and echo the work produced in sigirs previous three lessons learned reports among other things these capping reports underscore again how the reconstruction program has been limited by the unstable security environment the lack of an integrated organizational management structure the absence of program accountability the inadequate number and frequent turnover of personnel and the weak collaboration between u s and goi officials

1007381 you have to tend to the maintenance in other words you need to ensure that the place is stable and secure and functioning and effective and in a way the more your maintenance is normalised then the more space and capacity you have for development the maintenance structure is the skeleton the thing that holds the organisation together its where all the positional roles are but its only half the structure the rest is a development structure that has no relationship with maintenance other than serving it with learning its a very powerful structure and it provides a theoretical construct for why networked learning knots are so effective it connects with the allen and cherrey notion that networks have to work across around and within the hierarchical development wraps around and serves maintenance but it is also empowered by and liberated by maintenance structures

1007396 when you down to the nitty gritty the only way he can buy your home or any home is to have the seller give back a concession at closing
1007397 the propertys been on the market for xx days and the other offers youve had were worse concessions or no concessions
1007398 if the buyer can afford to buy my property for xxxx over 5 000 over the asking price then he can pay me all of it
1007399 he cant buy it without a concession he has very little money to put down
1007400 will you just focus on the fact that his offer was the highest and best in spite of the concession

1007409 sar facile per me avere informazione sui nostri avversari e poi conosco bene il calcio spagnolo
1007410 non siamo i favoriti quindi qualsiasi cosa otterremo contro il deportivo andr bene
1007411 abbiamo due grandi partite davanti a noi e non le affronteremo senza speranze
1007412 i nostri maggiori vantaggi sono che il deportivo non inizia il suo campionato fino al 31 agosto e che giocheremo la prima gara fuori casa non sanno molto di noi quindi possiamo sorprenderli e di fronte a tanti nostri tifosi al ritorno non potremo giocare male

1007414 the point about what i shall hereafter call mondegreens since no one else has thought up a word for them is that they are better than the original

1007417 they walked into the club and some bloke has just gone past and stared at todd just trying to stir him up
1007418 mitch just stepped in and said go away we dont want any dramas
1007419 he just didnt want todd in there because people were going to try to stir him up
1007420 but it was a private function he was going to anyway
1007421 im sick of people flinging mud at the kid thats just not true
1007422 he had a couple of beers thats all he wasnt drunk hes not that stupid
1007423 his off field behaviour has been unacceptable and we have made it clear that he needs to seek professional help to sort it out
1007424 its best that he be away from the club and away from football while he does that
1007425 in the event that once the scheme is finalised the cost imposed is unreasonable for the act to bear then of course the act government will look for appropriate adjustments to be made to commonwealth funding
1007426 vulnerable members of the act community are also not disadvantaged
1007427 the government does however recognise that the costs of combating climate change are and will continue to be significant but the costs of delay or inaction do not bear thinking about
1007428 if the commonwealth government is going to provide compensation to the big polluters i think there are places they spend their money more wisely
1007429 in doing so the commonwealth will raise a large amount of money
1007430 that doesnt vanish from the economy it needs to be redistributed
1007431 the point of the green paper is to generate discussion and engagement on the schemes design and we welcome submissions from all stakeholders including state governments
1007432 for the ato leadership work life balance is all well and good until life balance gets in the way of work and outputs
1007433 no wonder the atos comcare costs skyrocketed in the last decade
1007434 the commissioner michael dascenzo himself highlighted in my opinion the stupidity of the efficiency dividend in senate estimates recently
1007435 his words were to the effect that any loss of ato funding would result in a loss of revenue 10 times greater
1007436 the ato remuneration levels are trapped within public service boundaries for sought after graduates the pay is a pittance compared to accounting and law firms
1007437 there are a large number of ato officers in the 50 to 54 year old age bracket if they were to leave the ato would lose experience and expertise on a grand scale
1007438 the tax system especially the international tax system had to change as a consequence the ato and its thinking about international tax is lagging far behind these developments and has to change
1007439 now this is no bad thing in areas administering complex law
1007440 but when it pervades an organisation to the exclusion of vision and strategic thinking as it does in the ato then the organisation is in trouble at least in the long term
1007441 significantly ramped up our work on international issues such as tax havens transfer pricing global corporate restructures and cross border financing

1007458 many of these older fuel oil tanks are partially or fully buried or sealed and releases of oil cant be detected by odor many times its not until ground contamination is discovered or a minor permeation grows into a major leak that the problem is detected
1007459 most of these oil tanks were installed at the time the buildings were built in the 1940s 1950s 1960s and 1970s and they are much larger than doors stairs and hallways connecting their location to the outside making it almost impossible to remove and replace them intact with age these tanks can present serious problems new technologies now make it easy and cost efficient to refurbish these tanks in place saving thousands of dollars in replacement costs and virtually eliminating potential pollution problems
1007460 corrosion is a funny animal and the overall structural integrity of most of the steel tanks we examine is almost as good as the day it was installed the problems come from isolated corrosion cells making minute permeations through the steel shell of the tank allowed to grow these corrosion permeations can go from a minor weeping to a quarter inch hole if not addressed a lot of oil can escape from a small hole and it doesnt take a tanker load to cause a pollution problem
1007461 the refurbishing is sort of like a tank in a tank approach the fiberglass plastic or elastomeric lining system we fabricate inside the steel tank adds an additional structural wall and is not subject to corrosion the abrasive blasting process conditions the interior steel tank wall before we add the fiberglass or plastic this helps guard against future internal corrosion problems
1007462 we dont do environmental studies or cleanups so i wouldnt comment about that its our job to find minor problems or situations before they become problems and remedy them before you get to the point of needing environmental services
1007463 what we do isnt rocket science its just good sound engineering process

1007471 i was an interrogator for the u s army for 7 years and taught interrogation for 3 years i learned a lot some of the things i learned that can be applied to being a trial lawyer proper questioning control questions control of a witness these were good skills to learn and helpful in depositions and cross examination i used to tell people that interrogation was much more psychology and good questioning techniques than the torture you saw in rambo movies i used to tell people that the united states followed the geneva conventions and the hage laws of land warfare unfortunately i cant say that anymore but the questioning skills that i learned as an interrogator have been invaluable
1007472 legal process outsourcing lpo continues to be in the news
1007473 through my virtual law firm operation i have used an indian firm to do legal analysis for clients that im working with and the results have been excellent and it costs about 50 percent less than the cost of a u s paralegal since the person doing the work is an attorney trained in english common law the quality of the work is often better weve also assigned basic legal research as in compiling statutory materials on a particular subject for every jurisdiction this work has been excellent and our cost is about 12 an hour and that cost includes the cost of online legal research services this cost is less than it would cost to have the work done by a u s law student and the work is more reliable
1007474 feels more hesitant about sending more specialized legal services overseas at present he does foresee an expansion in how smaller u s firms will use the indian outsourcing firms to serve their needs and increase their efficiency going forward

1007495 wwe called me on the friday and asked me to a meeting on the monday i had the meeting with vince mcmahon and johnny ace and they said they wanted to see me wrestle i told them i was under contract to roh and all of that kind of stuff i think they know that i was trained by shawn michaels and william regal and i think shawns spoken about me which is how the whole thing came about
1007496 before this happened nick was moving through life and maybe no appreciating the things that he had its the best thing that ever happened to him im not saying its a good thing but it happened for a reason
1007497 the uproar regarding mike adamle being named as the new g m of monday night raw seems a little like overkill to me firstly i am not sure how prominent a role the raw g m will have going forward does any one as of today the object of any creative endeavor should be to establish wrestling stars and all those that are involved in the process should focus on that particular matter secondly adamle has yet to have one complete raw episode under his belt but he has apparently already been deemed a disaster by many fans and some pundits it would seem reasonable unless some one has a crystal ball that one would allow mike a few weeks to settle into his role and to see what individuality and entertainment content adamle can bring to the game personally i think it wold be easier for a newcomer like adamle to successfully pull off the general manager role easier than doing play by play
1007498 my take on todd grisham s first outing as the new play by play voice of ecw was that todd was successful todd has been around 5 years or so and he has the product knowledge and the quick wit to be a nice fit on the tuesday night broadcast todd does a mean impersonation of the late sportscaster harry carey and unlike many of those who try to replicate the former cubs announcer todd can do it sober todd should improve and i predict that some day if todd dedicates himself to his commentary work he will be moving on to bigger and better assignments
1007499 freddie prinze jr is going to be involved creatively in the smackdown brand from what i gather freddie is a big time wrestling fan and seems like a respectful and intelligent individual in the brief moment that we had to say hello a day or two ago it will be interesting to see freddie s future contributions within the unique wwe community freddie has achieved some great success in hollywood but the wwe is a much different animal that most perceive until they enter the wwe universe i just hope that friday night smackdown continues to feature more wrestling than not which is what i feel is still the wwe s most uniquely marketable asset in ring wrestling

1007507 there are two ways to hydrate and moisturize the skin one is to trap the moisture that already exists in your skin and the other is to add moisture to your skin through creams some consumers want even more moisture you cant just apply double the amount because your skin can only absorb so much so part of the reason weve invented infusion is to approach moisture using a different delivery system

1007513 the man who put away john gotti baby sat sammy bull gravano raided an al qaeda bomb factory and helped uncover the nba betting scandal says tim donaghy told the truth philip scala the recently retired fbi supervisory special agent in charge of the gambino squad which uncovered donaghys scheme of betting on basketball games he had officiated said he believes the disgraced referees claims that other refs were dirty
1007514 at first glance it is ludicrous to imagine that the nbas next big star would move overseas as hes trying to win championships and replace michael jordan as a household name globally but look at it this way neither the euroleague nor greek league impose any kind of salary cap on its teams which means there would be no ceiling on an offer that the billionaire ownership of olympiakos could make to james as a free agent in 2010 his new contract in the nba would start at less than 20 million annually what if olympiakos were to offer him 40 million per year or 50 million
1007515 quite frankly i dont really care whether an nba player lights up a blunt every now and then over the summer wanting to discuss the matter on the radio the day of a playoff game is pretty selfish and stupid but i dont believe anybody has ever died from inhaling marijuana on the other hand howard should be well aware of the dangers of street racing after all ex hornet bobby phills died while racing a teammate in howards home state too bad howard didnt learn a lesson from that tragedy
1007516 dallas mavericks owner mark cuban has gone from being a long shot to one of the favorites in the bidding to buy the cubs picking up support from nba commissioner david stern and others as the field of prospective owners narrows
1007517 no one better suited to reverse the fortunes of the cubs for the long term
1007518 when you watch the other teams who are experienced with international ball they initiate their offensive sets about six to eight feet back from the three point line their wing shooters hover a good three to four feet back from the line the us however like good nba players initiate their offense at or a few feet behind the three point line their wings toe it this is especially the case with slash minded players like anthony wade james and bryant in the nba this is fine the wider arc of the 3 point line adds another 6 feet to the space within it giving penetrators more room to operate and generating greater spacing but the international arc is so much shorter when a player penetrates the help defense has three or four fewer feet to cover to collapse on them

1007721 it may come as a surprise to some but the top 10 iyp headings mirror the top 10 print yellow pages headings typically because these headings drive so many on and offline queries it is not until we drill down beyond the top headings where differences emerge among print and internet local search behavior
1007722 these differences can be attributed to differences in consumers local search needs for product vs service oriented information and long term vs short term purchase plans

1007757 energy efficiency is the states preferred way to meet our growing energy needs as outlined in our energy action plan california has one of the most aggressive energy efficiency plans in the nation and todays decision improves those efforts to reflect a coordinated and comprehensive approach toward energy efficiency in order to maximize saving in the coming years
1007758 the criminally irresponsible failure of congress to execute these extensions that have broad bipartisan support is jeopardizing the industrys capacity to deliver and hit its cost targets
1007759 serving 33 percent of californias electricity needs with renewable sources will require an infrastructure build out on a scale and a timeline perhaps unparalleled in the world
1007760 its like this were building the car while we drive it and were trying to drive it very fast
1007761 the program is demonstrating that california has created a really vibrant market for renewable energy
1007762 theres a tendency to view the 2010 deadline as a litmus test for how well the programs working its important to set goals but in our view its far more important that we keep our eye on the ball which is reducing our dependence on fossil fuels
1007763 sarah lacys very readable book pulls back the veil from the new princes of web 2 0 and that it is as much about attitude as it is about business
1007764 its about tackling housing rehabilitation one neighborhood at a time
1007765 i grew up in these neighborhoods and the housing revitalization that we see happening in braddock and much of the mon valley is the truest form of change i have seen in many years
1007766 there has been little or no investment of this kind in the mon valley for years and we now see that people dont want to leave these communities if they have good and affordable housing
1007767 we are beginning to see what we have been talking about for years
1007768 the success of what we do depends on the strength of the community groups we work with and their commitment to identifying neighborhoods where we could make an impact
1007769 what we have found is that there are many nice houses in all of these neighborhoods but people often cant see that because of all the blight around them
1007770 we try to tackle such neighborhoods with expansive projects like a 25 house construction that can actually change the look of a neighborhood
1007771 we dont want the blight to spread many times we see neighborhoods which have pretty nice houses but then a few abandoned properties in the same area have the capacity to create other abandoned properties and absentee landlords
1007772 what we see mvi doing in the mon valley is a model of what we want to see happening in other parts of the state
1007773 it is a model of housing redevelopment that i hope places like philadelphia lancaster reading harrisburg and york will adopt
1007774 ello nos obliga a comenzar nuestro calendario dos ad as antes de la inauguraci n oficial de los juegos lo cual es tambi n un privilegio
1007775 el torneo que se avecina ser hist rico por algunas razones por primera vez tendremos 12 equipos de mujeres y adem s estamos conmemorando el centenario del f tbol en las olimpiadas nuestro camino se inici antes que el de todos los deportes de equipo en los juegos de 1908 celebrados en londres
1007776 en 1988 el congreso de la fifa acord limitar la edad de los jugadores para el torneo ol mpico lo hicimos porque no deb amos tener en las olimpiadas una segunda copa del mundo y porque as las asociaciones nacionales pod an trabajar con otra categor a agreg ndose a la sub 17 y la sub 20 pero desde entonces acordamos que todos los atletas deb an ser cedidos por los clubes y en 20 a os no hab amos tenido ning n problema ni siquiera con los tres mayores de 23 a os que se permiten como excepci n
1007777 ahora nos encontramos con la disputa por los jugadores lionel messi argentina rafinha y diego brasil quienes ya se encuentran en china y deber a permit rseles jugar con sus selecciones nacionales
1007778 no queremos influir en la decisi n pero es una cuesti n de respeto a los jugadores de solidaridad y de honrar al movimiento ol mpico
1007779 it used to be an entertainment center now its a juice bar
1007780 the first generation of e commerce software still prevalent in todays market was based on the traditional proprietary software model
1007781 this is software created by a staff of developers that is sold for hundreds or thousands of dollars and often requires monthly payments
1007782 prestashop on the other hand is a committed member of the open source software movement
1007783 and like other open source e commerce applications such as oscommerce prestashop is free its license ols 3 0 is one of the least restrictive and users arent even required to register first
1007784 businesses love prestashop because its easy to manage their online stores
1007785 customers love prestashop because its smooth web 2 0 interface is pleasant to shop on and software developers love prestashop because its easy to integrate and because the user community is very active and helpful for example prestashop users have already translated prestashop into over 20 different languages and its only at version 1 0
1007786 as a gaming company fraud is far more than a chargeback it is any unwanted activity that threatens our bottom line and impacts the integrity of the environment of our loyal players
1007787 paf has been building a powerful internal fraud team to tackle these activities and we see ethoca as the perfect partner to keep chip dumping at bay
1007788 most fraud management practices involve a one step decision making process that evaluates the companys own experiences but this should be a two step process that incorporates the payment experiences of others as well
1007789 paf is among the leaders in the gaming industry that have realized fraud prevention should not be done alone and this is precisely where ethoca shines ethoca can help companies improve checks against their own experiences but what makes the community so unique is the complete knowledge it provides from the experiences of others
1007790 we have always provided basic it management solutions to our clients but we see an opportunity to expand those offerings and become an end to end solution provider web developers saas providers and e commerce ventures will see the greatest benefit from new services under development by joining msp partners we gain access to market research vendor channels and other solution providers that accelerates our ability to deploy new solutions for our clients
1007791 no one company can do everything well you need a healthy ecosystem of infrastructure software and service providers to cultivate new services
1007792 i think my overall reaction is that its really sad that in 2008 i have people watching every single move i make
1007793 when theres a big game between the cubs and brewers going on its sad that thats what their focus is on and the last thing i had heard is that when you want to do a story on someone you contact them
1007794 with that said i still think reporters should hold themselves to the highest professional standard i found her dress to be inappropriate for the workplace even some brewers players said that although shes great to look at the dress wasnt appropriate for the ballpark
1007795 and i know what all the guys out there are going to say trenni is just being catty because shes jealous
1007796 this whole product is about if the threat cant execute it cant hurt you
1007797 given the challenges we see out there with cybercrime thats what its all about the volume of malware is not something anyone can keep up with so the focus is on ensuring that youre protected

1007842 the voices just wont go away my house has burned down but the pain does not compare with the tragedy i saw happen right in front of my eyes the worst was when the nine year old stood in front of the burglar gates holding on while people tried to help her
1007843 she waited hoping while she burned that she would be set free but instead the burglar guard fell on her and it was over i dont know how i will get over this trauma
1007844 my room was suddenly so hot and bright that the only thing i thought of was the door only after i had escaped did i realise that my shack was on fire and only then did i start to hear the cries of others whose homes were burning

1007860 as these delegates go about the important business of the convention i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories

1007896 the film seeks to explore why bees matter as much as to answer the question of why they are dying off
1007897 ccd and the other diseases affecting bees are a huge environmental disasters if the bees are gone then whats next for us humans
1007898 she sent the clipping to me and suggested i make a film on the subject and so the journey began it seemed to me a remarkable story that told us everything about the challenges human beings face in saving our planet from environmental disaster
1007899 the world of beekeepers seemed like an extraordinary world that could be explored beautifully on film via an american producer i hooked up with my fellow filmmakers george and maryam and together we agreed to set about making what we felt would be the definitive film on this important subject
1007900 by opening peoples eyes and not lecturing them we hope to put together an outreach campaign all people need to do is plant a flower in their window box and theyll be making a difference because by providing food for the bees they will be helping bees to survive so they will not only brighten up their lives but help save the planet

1007911 if you talked to me or other scientists just a few years ago we were saying that we might lose all or most of the summer sea ice cover by anywhere from 2050 to 2100
1007912 then recently we kind of revised those estimates maybe as early as 2030 now theres people out there saying it might be even before that so things are happening pretty quick up there
1007913 the challenge of progressivism which appears to have been cursed by an activist base consisting of hundreds of thousands of overeducated over informed under experienced and occasionally vicious arnold horshacks what makes the progressive agenda irremediably fatuous is that when push comes to shove they settle for securing their leaderships privilege

1007922 ok he hasnt said much in the past but look at his campaign platform right now it says he supports total equity of civil marriage for gays in all respects period al gore by contrast wont make such a strong statement al gores platform says he is personally opposed to gay marriage but wants to legislate all the 1000 different marriage rights for civil partners one at a time which of those sounds better for gays
1007923 ok well maybe ralph has the better platform but its easy for him to say that because hes never going to be elected in a million years and even if he is hell never be able to pass that through congress we need somebody who is electable and can actually negotiate and pass things through congress even if its one tiny step at a time
1007924 ok ralph has the better platform but we need to be elected first we need political power
1007925 the lesson i took away was that at least for the dems among my sample gaining power trumped pretty much

1007935 she told me about it and i applied in june i found out i was chosen about two days later when my teacher called and told me i was practically speechless
1007936 were going to have lectures and workshops they have their own microscope on the boat so we can take plants from the land that we go on
1007937 i expect to see a lot of walruses and polar bears maybe some orcas seals and northern seabirds
1007938 i hope to learn how i can protect the world and how we effect the arctic
1007939 i like to learn about the environment and i think its going to be a lot of fun
1007940 were at a point now where a solution can be found but there are still quite a number of hurdles to overcome
1007941 we have to do due diligence on this now to ensure its the best place possible for the hospital and college
1007942 its very time consuming and certainly its a high priority but we cant rush into it
1007943 we have to make sure we have all the answers to manage the risk
1007944 they didnt go into a whole lot of detail but they did state there were unforeseen circumstances that would prevent them from getting to construction in this construction season
1007945 i think it was something to do with pricing of materials or getting materials here on time they did mention there were a lot of houses for sale on the market right now as well
1007946 the first benchmark is they have to submit their engineering drawings for the water and sewer infrastructure by oct 31 2008
1007947 the second benchmark is as soon as theyve met the first benchmark they have to get a permit to construct which is issued by the provincial government department of environment and conservation and it has to be provided to the town by dec 31 2008
1007948 if they dont meet a benchmark the extension is no longer in effect
1007949 when a developer puts in a permit in for land its in effect for a year however if they dont have title to the land they wouldnt be able to sell the land if they dont meet one of the benchmarks we would entertain more development permits for the land
1007950 weve had about four or five along the churchill road trans labrador highway and we had one last week just outside of goose bay
1007951 we have two air tankers stationed in labrador one in goose bay and one in wabush
1007952 we also have a helicopter on standby for the suppression effort as well and we have over 30 fire staff in labrador they run in shifts and crews but if we run into a situation where we require additional resources we have the ability to request those from the island portion of the province where we have four air tankers
1007953 we encourage people to enjoy the outdoors and obviously having a fire is part of outdoors activity and a way of life but when people are using fire we just want to remind the general public to be in compliance with the forest fire regulations
1007954 if you are having a fire never leave your fire unattended and make sure you have adequate water on hand to extinguish the fire when youre finished
1007955 quite often fires are reported by fishing lodges or camps or aircraft flying over the area
1007956 normally they would report a fire and give us the coordinates and we use what is called a modified response we will monitor those fires and check them out and see if there any values at risk whether its fishing camps or communities and then well decide whether well end up with any suppression effort on those fires
1007957 a boil order would be called if there was a known pathogen or something serious here with serious health effects like if there was beaver fever so this is not a boil order
1007958 absolutely not this is only the second time since the upgrade a couple of years ago

1007968 this is the clearest picture weve ever had of new hiv infections occurring in the united states
1007969 we have to do more as individuals communities and a nation to make sure were doing everything we can to stop the further spread of hiv
1007970 the magnitude of new infections is larger than previously thought but we have the same picture of whos at risk
1007971 these new cdc numbers lend credence to what public health officials have long been saying that hiv is alive and well and thriving in certain communities in the u s
1007972 using these advanced methods to paint a more accurate picture of the numbers of new hiv infections is important for working out where our prevention messages have worked and where there is a need for improvement its time to take a precision strike approach towards hiv prevention in this country
1007973 there are too many unknowns in this study to make conclusions about the relationship between cough and cold medicine and altes

1007981 this important survey should serve as a clarion call to the nonprofit and philanthropy sector to boost the resources and training devoted to this critical function
1007982 we talk to men about the things that are happening in their lives right now and we challenge them to do something about it
1007983 guys respond to a challenge the lord will help them but they have to admit that something is not right in their life
1007984 men dont think of the lord when things are rockin and rollin when things start turning bad thats when we need to be available to the men
1007985 yao watches some movies and plays some of his video games thats going to change
1007986 he always has a notebook never stops talking to people on the phone he has three or four but i didnt really understand until i had to do it with the earthquake thats when you understand its not something you just do you have to put your heart into it

1007997 we get to relieve consumers of their unwanted iphones and prevent hazardous waste from entering landfills by recycling rechargeable batteries
1007998 with the current environment favoring sustainable types of products including packaging we have had a sharp increase in the level of interest from both large consumer goods and health and beauty care companies that require a package with a higher aesthetic appeal
1007999 the fact that we can deliver a part that satisfies some of the most critical eyes in the health and beauty care market and have that part be made from 100 post consumer recycled content is very satisfying
1008000 economic pressures mean that organisations need to be more agile than ever before
1008001 waiting weeks for a single change to a business process can lead to a loss of revenue and the failure to capitalise on market opportunities microgen aptitude enables it and business users to work together in order to optimise the performance of business processes and ensure that they are driving operational efficiency
1008002 a current trend is for it to empower business analysts to write their own business rules
1008003 microgen aptitude models business processes builds applications and is integrated to get the application to production faster in a language the business user speaks
1008004 mythic paint is a revolutionary non toxic product that offers premium performance without vocs
1008005 by using mythic consumers are not only protecting their families and pets they are also protecting the general air quality of their surroundings being recognized by the aqmd is just one more confirmation that we are doing our part to reduce ground level ozone and thus improve our world
1008006 many of these older fuel oil tanks are partially or fully buried or sealed and releases of oil cant be detected by odor many times its not until ground contamination is discovered or a minor permeation grows into a major leak that the problem is detected
1008007 most of these oil tanks were installed at the time the buildings were built in the 1940s 1950s 1960s and 1970s and they are much larger than doors stairs and hallways connecting their location to the outside making it almost impossible to remove and replace them intact with age these tanks can present serious problems new technologies now make it easy and cost efficient to refurbish these tanks in place saving thousands of dollars in replacement costs and virtually eliminating potential pollution problems
1008008 corrosion is a funny animal and the overall structural integrity of most of the steel tanks we examine is almost as good as the day it was installed the problems come from isolated corrosion cells making minute permeations through the steel shell of the tank allowed to grow these corrosion permeations can go from a minor weeping to a quarter inch hole if not addressed a lot of oil can escape from a small hole and it doesnt take a tanker load to cause a pollution problem
1008009 the refurbishing is sort of like a tank in a tank approach the fiberglass plastic or elastomeric lining system we fabricate inside the steel tank adds an additional structural wall and is not subject to corrosion the abrasive blasting process conditions the interior steel tank wall before we add the fiberglass or plastic this helps guard against future internal corrosion problems
1008010 we dont do environmental studies or cleanups so i wouldnt comment about that its our job to find minor problems or situations before they become problems and remedy them before you get to the point of needing environmental services

1008023 skepticism about gadgets that help improve fuel economy is rampant in both the media and the public and theres also lots of noise about various oil additives and fuel additives
1008024 cermet gets carried to a vehicles engine by the oil but it has a fuel saving effect that lasts long after the oil is changed our challenge is to cut through the clutter and get this message to the media and the target markets

1008027 and then after that come back to use the gras telescopes hopefully with more skills
1008028 i enjoyed using gras as im traveling quite a bit and have no way to image and its become an addiction
1008029 at first there were some difficulties with using gras but the customer response was first rate and i was given extra minutes in compensation after that i took some nice pictures which i was able to manipulate in maxim and photoshop
1008030 much fun i am looking forward in the future to doing some narrow band imaging on your scopes until such a time as i can settle down and set up a permanent observatory of my own
1008031 the global network of gras of telescopes is world class in every respect my first experience of the g13 telescope in south australia produced an awe inspiring image of the triffid nebula

1008057 i couldnt do my job anymore but it wasnt on my timeline and i wasnt in control
1008058 its far more commonplace for retirement to come earlier than expected than for it to happen according to some plan
1008059 its important for people to begin saving to anticipate a period of a year or two or sometimes longer where their income is going to drop and they need to retool for another phase of their working lives
1008060 i wasnt ready the part that was the hardest was figuring out who am i without my work because i had been working for so long
1008061 if youre forced to retire and you havent hit your saving goal or you separate from your job before you can get medicare
1008062 unhappiness can persist at least through 10 years if not more
1008063 youve got to start thinking at any point i could be retired
1008064 take a good snapshot of where you are financially and think if i am forced to retire in the next year or two what does that mean for me personally or financially
1008065 building up an emergency fund can help also consider disability payments health insurance until medicare eligibility kicks in at age 65 life insurance to support any dependents and long term care insurance
1008066 even if you get ownsized someone will want to hire you
1008067 we hypothesize that they are returning because once retiring its not what they thought it would be and they take a dent to their asset portfolios

1008069 we are continuing to lobby congress for a returning worker exemption
1008070 we are hoping to move it in september when congress returns from august recess

1008217 it was originally burning on some bad ground on a hill that was very hard to access and fight on crews worked overnight to bring it down off the hill to an area they can access better
1008218 it has grown from when it was reported first saturday night it started off as about 10 hectares and is now around 30 however instead of having to fight it on bad ground by bringing it to us we can get our heavy equipment on it a lot easier
1008219 we have a fresh crew on it this morning including two helicopters we will likely be ordering in another crew later today we dont have an estimate on how much of the blaze is contained but we are making good progress

1008254 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
1008255 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks for our mission critical applications this experience demonstrates the value companies looking at virtualized recovery solutions can gain by tapping sungards expertise rather than handling internally
1008256 server virtualization will dramatically change the it recovery services model for both the services provider and the customer with replication to a shared storage infrastructure and a virtualized server infrastructure customers can enjoy improved recovery time and recovery point objectives without the cost of dedicated and custom recovery solutions from the dr service provider
1008257 the achilles heel of most virtualized it environments is that they rely on a single data center to facilitate system failover should an event occur
1008258 a recovery strategy with no off site data may mean quite possibly no recovery virtual server replication services provides organizations an affordable way to have access to a secondary data center for protection of physical and virtual it environments

1008272 we announced a 30 man squad for the tri nations home leg and the other four players are still on hand and can come back any time
1008273 because we have good relations with the provinces we can ask them to play these guys in certain positions
1008274 ruan pienaar has not played a lot at flyhalf and i had a long chat with john plumtree pienaar and steyns coach at the sharks and he knows why the players are there
1008275 it was a massive privilege just to be there to shake his hand

1008285 en m xico hay una mujer infectada por cada tres hombres esta cifra preocupa y ocupa a las autoridades federales y locales para conjuntar esfuerzos en la prevenci n del sida pero lo peor es que muchos no saben que est n infectados de este virus

1008516 its clear from research weve done that parents want to know their childs results and whether there is a concern about their health but they want clear information which is helpful and non stigmatising
1008517 today weve published guidance which will help pcts deliver this programme and help to make sure parents get the information they need about their childs results in ways that they have said will be most helpful
1008518 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1008519 schools are well placed to make a real difference in tackling obesity with record investment in sport and exercise encouraging active travel to and from home making cooking compulsory in secondary schools scrapping junk food and transforming the quality of school lunches
1008520 but at the end of the day parents bring up children not the government schools or health services every parent wants their child to be fit and healthy so its only right to help them make informed decisions about their lives
1008521 what more can i say to you you know what your servant is really like sovereign l

1008560 what has happened is the supreme court found that the right to marriage includes same sex couples
1008561 this happened after the original title was approved now same sex couples have a right thats recognized and supporters of the proposition want to eliminate that right

1008653 we all agree that the welfare state has got to be radically reformed
1008654 labour needed to stand for steadfast social democratic values but offer innovative means to achieve their delivery
1008655 first to show how a progressive government seeking a strong economy and fair society should not only support but positively enhance markets in the public interest
1008656 second applying that same public interest test to recognise that there are limits to markets not only where as a matter of morality we have always accepted they have no place but also in those areas as a matter of practicality where they do not and cannot be made to work and hence where we should support public provision as the more equitable efficient and responsive solution
1008657 third to set out how we can avoid the trap of simply replacing market failure with state failure and applying the same public interest test achieve equity efficiency and diversity by reforming and modernising the public realm for the decades ahead in particular through devolution transparency and accountability
1008658 the problem for the left in the past was that they equated the public interest with public ownership and public regulation and therefore they assumed that markets were not in the public interest
1008659 the idea that markets must work in the public interest the idea that governments have a responsibility for the level of employment and prosperity in the economy the idea that governments must intervene on occasions these are increasingly the ideas of our time
1008660 the question is can we manage it in the interests of a few or in the interests as i want it to be of all the people of the world

1008697 he blair was asked about the nuclear threat yet again and again he was general about it saddam was trying to acquire nuclear weapons and would get them some time but as hed said before for four long years there had been no inspections here was the root of world scepticism why now was britain really threatened by him blair answered that we were if saddam began a new war in the middle east wed be drawn in as we were in the gulf war british interests would be threatened so much so obvious he wouldnt talk about timetables there was nothing really newsy it was frankly disappointing as the journalists milled around afterwards the sunday reporters were under immediate pressure to deliver several thought saddams nuclear threat to britain was the headline by the time some of the sundays had done their work you would have thought a nuclear strike on birmingham was only weeks away this distortion did not annoy blairs team far from it it helped them in their task of trying to move public opinion towards war yet it did so in a way that could not be blamed on blair he had chosen his words carefully journalists had hyped them up in a way that was hugely helpful number ten benefited the reporters benefited they had justified their expensive airline tickets and salaries for another week the newspapers benefited they had strong looking dramatic front page stories that might help win sales in shops and petrol stations only the public had been short changed they had been given a story which happened to be a scare story some of them would remember and mistrust the news a little more next time a handful might even stop buying the paper but most would forget the distortion nuance doesnt make for good headlines soon photocopies of the sunday front pages were faxed to the downing street staffers with us who passed them around there were hoots of laughter and wry grins at the spine chilling headlines and shameless overwriting

1008707 the most important property of these junctions is that their conductance is at least an order of magnitude higher than comparable junctions made using thiol anchoring groups
1008708 under our experimental conditions the junctions can be held stable for a very long time which when combined with the cryogenic temperatures used allows us to make detailed investigations
1008709 what makes this work stand out is that the scientists have presented a new way to attach organic molecules to metal electrodes by forming a direct metal carbon bond and have proven conclusively that their devices have a strong metal molecule link
1008710 this enables them to overcome a major barrier in molecular based devices

1008725 we chose to bring this game to the west because we believe in its potential the guaranteed fun promotion is our way of showing our belief in the game and is even better than a money back guarantee because you dont have to spend a penny to play asda story
1008726 we are just asking you to invest your time in playing our game and if after playing for 30 days you dont feel it has been the great game experience we feel it to be we want to hear your feedback and well give you 30 00 it is as simple as that

1008731 by the time american students are in junior high and high school they hate school and cannot wait to finish an acceptable terminal level of education and establish careers and families mimicking the suburban lifestyles of their parents
1008732 our schools are failing because they are warehouses and work houses
1008733 they verge on penal colonies where teachers are wardens and children are inmates children constitute a pre labor force tasked with producing homework instead of goods and services
1008734 grading and testing would be minimized and teachers would not be cops or dictators schools would have fewer desks and more open space homework would be minimized as real teaching and dialogue fill the day formulaic writing would be replaced by essaying journaling and thought pieces standardized tests would be replaced with portfolios of best work and art

1008740 if something happens to butch james then i cant bring in a guy who has not been playing
1008741 the players all need to keep sharp and its best if i allow the guys to play not standing around holding kit bags
1008742 its not only about the flyhalves we also have to get the composition of the whole team right
1008743 percy montgomery will never start a game at flyhalf while i am coach but if theres an emergency during the game then we can call on him and he will do a good job there
1008744 with any selection the landscape can change if i decide i want a second flyhalf on the bench then i can call ruan pienaar back immediately
1008745 we announced a 30 man squad for the tri nations home leg and the other four players are still on hand and can come back anytime
1008746 because we have good relations with the provinces we can ask them to play these guys in certain positions
1008747 ruan pienaar has not played a lot at flyhalf and i had a long chat with john plumtree pienaar and steyns coach at the natal sharks and he knows why the players are there
1008748 it was a massive privilege just to be there to shake his hand if i live to that age i hope i look as good as he does
1008749 nobody has anything against that old man he is a legend in his own lifetime and few people can say that

1008763 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
1008764 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
1008765 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
1008766 although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return general manager ted thompson and coach mike mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place
1008767 coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
1008768 we have a great relationship and once he comes here we will welcome him back i will prepare the same way brett was a great resource when he was here i will still tap into his knowledge i am still the starter until they tell me something different

1008785 i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races there is a physical difference between the two which in my judgment will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference i am in favor of the race to which i belong having the superior position

1008803 this study lays the groundwork for understanding the nature of different mutations in cancers
1008804 and helps with understanding the mechanisms of cancers and their responses to drug treatments

1008809 we found significant variations for early stage prostate cancer quality indicators there were differences in care from community hospitals to cancer centers to teaching hospitals there were also disparities in care from one region of the country to another but there were no racial disparities suggesting equity in care once a patient initiates treatment
1008810 if these variations in care can be eliminated thereby providing uniform quality it may lead to improved outcomes for patients
1008811 this study suggests that doctors may want to start reviewing the diet of children during early well child visits
1008812 by the time they reach eight years old theyre already far into the overweight category making treatment more difficult
1008813 i didnt think that that obesity would start that early
1008814 information on family history and the dietary and exercise habits in infancy
1008815 we may then have to look prospectively to see what interventions work in reversing this trend
1008816 this is a very subtle difference but it is significant
1008817 persons with emerging als may also have similarly subtle symptoms
1008818 we can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants
1008819 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well
1008820 the discovery of reliable behavioral endpoints with predictive validity even before a good understanding of their etiology is achieved can significantly improve intervention research
1008821 when the fracture results in nanoplates it leads to a low level of fracture energy at a certain size resulting in a size specific fracture

1008875 modern desktop and server processors dont access memory directly using its physical address they use to separate the addresses that processes use to read and write memory from the actual memory itself this allows operating systems to hide from processes all the dirty details of how much memory there is where in physical memory the process needs to write to and so on
1008876 however the actual processor still needs to translate from a to the physical memory address in order to actually read and write any memory this translation is done with something called
1008877 page tables are used to implement virtual memory by mapping virtual addresses to physical addresses
1008878 when we create a virtual machine we virtualize the memory as well that means that the guest operating systems idea of physical memory does not match up to real physical memory on the host
1008879 this means that any fully virtualized operating system like windows will create page tables using guest physical memory and will point the base pointer at the guest physical address of the top level page table unfortunately the hardware still needs to map from virtual memory address to machine addresses not guest physical addresses
1008880 in order to allow this to happen the hypervisor sets up
1008881 what this means is that whenever the guest operating system wants to map some new memory after it writes the data into the page table but before it can actually use it the hypervisor needs to translate the change to the guest page table into changes to the shadow page table so any workload that involves a lot of this will necessarily involve the hypervisor a lot which causes overhead
1008882 the hypervisor allocates a certain amount of memory for each vm to use for shadow page tables this is called shadow page table memory as new page tables are created and old ones arent used anymore the hypervisor cycles through this shadow page table memory when it needs a new page and there isnt enough it will unshadow the guest page tables that havent been used for the longest time to reclaim shadow memory so that it can use more
1008883 we dont know ahead of time how much shadow memory a given workload will use but we can estimate based on the amount of memory that the vm has we allocate enough shadow memory for each page to be mapped once more or less then add an extra 50 to have some slack for all the workloads weve tested thats been enough except xenapp
1008884 xenapp is the one workload weve found that requires more shadow page table memory than our standard default because xenapp generally starts hundreds of copies of the same process the same memory ends up mapped in hundreds of different processes what happens when all of those processes are active is that xenserver is continually unshadowing one process page tables in order to shadow another process pagetables only to have to re shadow the original ones a second or two later when it runs again this is called thrashing when theres not enough of a limited resource

1008994 the fact that more people in the united states are infected with hiv every year than previously thought shows that we need to be working much harder to control the epidemic in the united states
1008995 the united states can be proud of having more than tripled its remarkable commitment to the global hiv aids epidemic

1009005 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
1009006 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels therefore the therapeutic window to achieve an optimal risk benefit ratio of gh in individuals with hiv abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance may be very narrow and difficult to achieve
1009007 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
1009008 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
1009009 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
1009010 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
1009011 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

1009013 while adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media are rare they are encountered regularly by all physicians who administer contrast material to patients and some of these reactions will require treatment
1009014 we reviewed our experience to determine how often we encountered these reactions in our practice and how often the reactions required treatment we also wanted to know what happened to those patients who required treatment particularly when they had reactions that were moderate or severe
1009015 commonly used medications can be administered safely however treatment errors are not uncommon and in a few instances can lead to patient morbidity
1009016 in our study we found a number of instances in which non recommended treatment was provided these cases included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula rather than mask and at lower than recommended doses over utilization of diphenhydramine including to a few patients who were hypotensive and the administration of higher than recommended doses of epinephrine as well as occasional confusion about which concentrations of epinephrine should be injected in which manner subcutaneously or intravenously in our study the most striking example of patient morbidity from non recommended treatment occurred in the two patients who received doses of 1 mg of epinephrine in the absence of cardiopulmonary arrest who both had cardiac complications fortunately these complications were mild and transient and caused no serious morbidity
1009017 in nearly every population of adult surgical patients either medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis reduces venous thromboembolism by approximately 70 if one assumes similar efficacy in pregnant women 5 of the 7 deaths from pulmonary embolism in women undergoing cesarean delivery would have been prevented if a policy of universal use of medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cesarean had been in place such a policy would reduce the mortality rate attributed causally to cesarean delivery to 0 9 100 000 or approximately 9 us deaths annually eliminating the statistical difference in deaths attributed to cesarean vs vaginal birth
1009018 we already know that approximately 25 of men and 9 of women in the middle age bracket in australia stop breathing during sleep at least five times per hour
1009019 however because sleep apnea is strongly associated with obesity and its related diseases it has been difficult in the past to produce clear evidence that increased mortality is a result of osa and not because of other established causes
1009020 that evidence is now available and shows that moderate to severe sleep apnea is associated with about five times the risk of dying after you control for other factors that are already known to cause premature death
1009021 there is a need for high quality clinical trials looking at treatments for sleep apnea that are large enough and long enough to find out whether we can prevent disease or reduce mortality risk
1009022 obstructive sleep apnea is a deadly disease and it is now time for public health and medical practitioners as well as the general public to take it seriously
1009023 the health profession needs to look closely at ways of detecting sleep apnea in children adolescents and young adults to prevent sleep apnea in the over 40 years age group sleep apnea linked to increased risk of death
1009024 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
1009025 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
1009026 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
1009027 we assumed that telemedicine was a good idea but it hadnt been scientifically tested until now
1009028 using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
1009029 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
1009030 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome
1009031 the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
1009032 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine
1009033 this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s
1009034 what this study tells us is that we need a bigger trial to determine the difference if any in clinical outcomes for these patients

1009039 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
1009040 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
1009041 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
1009042 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
1009043 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
1009044 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia

1009048 for a disease that has been transformed from almost uniformly fatal to manageable over decades the impact of treatment decisions is substantial
1009049 disease management remains challenged by toxicities maintenance of adherence clinical manifestations related to both the drugs and the hiv infection itself and the threat of drug resistance sustainability and expansion of the progress achieved will depend on maintaining a robust drug development pipeline and the ability to deliver effective therapy and monitoring tools to the worlds affected populations
1009050 we hope this trial will be viewed as timely and beneficial research in an area where there is clearly a demonstrated need for safe and effective products to treat cold and flu in children who suffer from these ailments much more than adults
1009051 these results are promising and support the development of a childrens formulation
1009052 current estimates suggest that 41 to 45 of children in canada and the united states use nhps
1009053 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1009054 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
1009055 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
1009056 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
1009057 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
1009058 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
1009059 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
1009060 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
1009061 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
1009062 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
1009063 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops

1009310 lo importante es que en el deporte espa ol estamos viviendo en 2008 el mejor a o de la historia deportiva y cuando me preguntan en el coi por qu ganamos todo les respondo que por 3 factores
1009311 el primero de ellos el arranque de barcelona 92 el segundo el plan ado d ebecas que permiten a los atletas entrenarse sin la presi n del sacrificio econ mico y el tercero la profesionalizaci n de los dirigentes deportivos
1009312 tambi n que espa a cuenta como el mejor secretario de estado para el deporte en la persona de jaime lizzavetsky y que el presidente del comit ol mpico espa ol coe alejandro blanco se dedica d a y noche a la labor ol mpica
1009313 conozco bien a china han preparado unas instalaciones deportivas nicas nunca se hab a visto algo semejante como el estadio ol mpico el nido y la piscina ol mpica el cubo
1009314 cuando empiecen los juegos ser n la primera noticia de todos los medios de comunicaci n
1009315 estoy contento de estar aqu y con bastante actividad como un viejo amigo de china que siempre crey en ellos
1009316 es consciente d ela importancia para el futuro del movimiento ol mpico de los jjoo de pek n
1009317 jacques rogges est siendo un gran presidente puesto que es dif cil aunque tampoco es f cil ser ex presidente y lo importante es saber estar en segunda l nea
1009318 creo que se est n abriendo las puertas para espa a en china
1009319 lo que pido es que dejen jugar a los futbolistas merecen respeto cuando sus selecciones les piden que jueguen en ellas estoy un poco sorprendido por la postura tan fuerte adoptada por los clubes no s lo contra fifa sino tambi n contra los jugadores
1009320 para m uno no es m s importante que el otro desde ni o estas dos metas han sido mi sue o no me gustar a retirarme de la nba sin ganar un anillo y otro de mis anhelos siempre hab a sido participar en unos juegos ahora estoy en pek n y quiero ganar
1009321 lo que decida estar bien para m por supuesto que me encantar a portar la bandera pero tambi n hay otros compa eros que acumulan cuatro o cinco juegos y tienen todo el derecho
1009322 s que aqu hay locura por este deporte y que todas las entradas se han agotado jugar en un pabell n abarrotado siempre te motiva m s
1009323 mi sue o es ser campe n y ganar esa medalla para brasil
1009324 me siento muy contento jugar con ellos me siento muy honrado y tengo que entrenar mucho
1009325 ya no soy el joven que arras en sydney 2000 ya he cumplido los 30 a os y tengo que utilizar mis recursos con moderaci n creo que podr a conseguir una medalla en 200 metros pues exceptuando a michael phelps no me creo inferior a nadie
1009326 la verdad es que el n mero de reservas no ha alcanzado nuestras expectativas
1009327 total acceso posible para informar sobre los juegos ol mpicos
1009328 no hay acuerdo de ning n tipo para aceptar restricciones
1009329 peticiones a las ciudades organizadoras sobre esta materia siempre son las mismas y no se han modificado desde que el coi firm un contrato con pek n en 2001
1009330 hoy la prensa acreditada puede acceder al sitio en mandar n de la bbc a wikipedia y a las p ginas de varias ong y de grupos de presi n desde el centro principal de prensa en pek n y otras sedes ol mpicas esto no tiene precedentes
1009331 cuando se concedieron los juegos de 2008 a pek n el coi pidi que se permitiera a los medios el total acceso posible para informar sobre los juegos y el bocog ha dicho que se encargar de ello
1009332 la nica cosa que pod a hacer era mirar la televisi n y cuanto m s miraba los partidos sentado en el sill n m s triste me pon a
1009333 hasta un cierto d a era un ejemplo para todos y justo despu s era como diego armando maradona cuando estaba en el centro de las pol micas
1009334 cuando estoy de vacaciones hago lo que quiero durante la temporada me comporto como un profesional serio no fallo nunca
1009335 falso s lo que no quiero pesar en los otros problemas mios
1009336 my parents give me only 100 baht 3 dollars a day which is not enough
1009337 ninguna dificultad puede doblegar el esp ritu del pueblo chino
1009338 el traspaso est hecho y se concretar la semana pr xima
1009339 si me pongo a pensar en todo lo que me est pasando me caigo de espaldas ahora s lo tengo que tener en la cabeza el torneo de los juegos y luchar por una medalla de oro
1009340 con juan rom n riquelme y lionel messi en el equipo argentina tiene muchas posibilidades de ganar este torneo

1009345 s lo 18 pa ses tienen a m s de 100 atletas clasificados en estos juegos ol mpicos y venezuela est en esa tabla
1009346 un podio ser a importante porque desde ah se empieza el futuro de venezuela con la gimnasia
1009347 venezuela va a empezar a explotar como potencia deportiva a partir del 2016
1009348 para demostrar al mundo el deseo sincero de compartir las ventajas del desarrollo y afrontar el futuro con confianza al lado de otras naciones
1009349 gracias al apoyo del coi y de los otros miembros de la familia ol mpica

1009374 we must look to what god is doing not what he is not doing
1009375 all of a sudden these words came out father i cry out for this mans soul if he does not know you raise him from the dead
1009376 the reason i pray for people is because i found early in my trained practice that there were miracles unexplained healings
1009377 as i entered the er it was like a war zone
1009378 a voice told me to turn around and pray for that man
1009379 holy spirit fall god is here we want more more more more
1009380 i say you have nothing to lose but your sickness if the doctors cant help you why wouldnt you give god a chance
1009381 god is moving and people know something is happening here
1009382 i dont think it fits neatly into any branch of christianity
1009383 mr bentleys worldview appears to be a mixture of new age notions an obsession with the paranormal and an untutored grasp of christian theology
1009384 the bible talks about jesus healing sick people it says he was moved by compassion so part of it is gods heart of compassion
1009385 i felt like what was a warm water flow from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet
1009386 continues to draw his standard salary set by his board from his office in canada it is a modest salary and is in the five figure range
1009387 i dont have time to debate whether revival is happening or not i dont have time to nitpick the reasons why god might not be moving
1009388 id hope they wouldnt get distracted by movements that seem odd or by how goofy christians can be so that they miss seeing jesus as the most beautiful good loving just true person there is
1009389 jesus i do not believe you are the son of god but if you are i invite you to come into my heart i do not believe your blood has any power to forgive my sin but if there is any forgiveness through your blood i accept it jesus if you can build a relationship between god who created the whole world and my heart then of course i give you full permission to do anything you want with my life and my heart
1009390 i honor you it is a privilege for me to meet you you still are a man of god i want you to know the the holy spirit is going to come upon you and restore everything that was lost in your life and the best is yet to come god loves you and understands and is jealous for the escobar family and he is going to come to you your wife and this whole family and you will preach again and it will not be like it was before

1009400 they are taking a much more conservative allocation decreasing their focus to equities
1009401 in the wealth management business you have to take a very long term perspective we are investing for the next decade or so
1009402 como har a cualquier directivo no estamos obligados pero se hace si es necesario
1009403 la verdad es que ni lo he pensado ni lo tengo calculado
1009404 lo haremos sin deber nada a nadie con cinco equipos a nuestro cargo y en una situaci n que a muchos ya les gustar a tener
1009405 ha costado pero creo que ya hemos pasado lo peor con nuestro abogado en madrid supe esperar porque con l ten a un buen feeling al respecto
1009406 antes en el proceso hab an muchos esc pticos que se re an de s lo pensar en que el obradoiro fuera aceptado en la acb ahora s lo espero que se acerque gente dispuesta a invertir
1009407 s tienes raz n pero no s lo en el baloncesto no hace mucho sali publicado que los clubes de f tbol deben m s de 600 millones de euros a hacienda
1009408 se puede ayudar de muchas formas no en vano el obradoiro promocionar la ciudad en la acb
1009409 obradoiro ten a un pabell n y un piso pero por problemas econ micos se tuvo que vender
1009410 la experiencia nos indica que en el baloncesto no hay negocio y que antes que invertir en patrimonio el dirigente deportivo prefiere invertir en la plantilla
1009411 a nosotros ser de 700 000 euros pero el resto lo tienen mucho m s alto
1009412 parte de lo que ganemos ser para tenerlo como fondos propios
1009413 bueno nosotros ya estuvimos en la lite hace mucho tiempo
1009414 bueno no hemos intervenido porque tampoco nos han dejado pero comprendo lo que me consultas
1009415 en primer lugar participaremos para cumplir una sentencia judicial que ha sido un ejemplo de limpieza deportiva
1009416 la acb no deja de ser un coto privado en el que unas personas con m s galones imponen su criterio al resto y que si una de las cosas que re ne el hecho de participar en la acb es la de influir en la toma de decisiones en el baloncesto de lite nacional desde los descensos los ascensos y las licencias a realmente est n preparados para ello
1009417 por cuestiones profesionales he podido tratar con gente muy influyente y no no me da ning n miedo el tener que influir en las asambleas de la acb
1009418 quiz s las primeras temporadas sea una persona plenipotenciaria y ya nos han llegado ofrecimientos de personas importantes con experiencia acb
1009419 con ello el dirigente gallego me estaba dando la raz n en la importancia de la experiencia y los galones en la acb y es que para esta pr xima temporada me confirm que continuar an en primera nacional
1009420 tuvimos la posibilidad de jugar en eba pero econ micamente nos compensaba continuar tal y como est bamos
1009421 la acb nos pidi que nos esper ramos una temporada m s fue la primera interesada de hecho si en febrero nos hubieran avisado podr amos estar participando esta misma temporada
1009422 no lo hab amos pensado y s tal como lo expones la rentabilidad es relevante
1009423 me parece que el tema de las ventas de las plazas corresponde aceptarlas a la misma acb por un convenio firmado en el a o 98
1009424 desde luego los 700 000 de inversi n y su posterior venta dar a una rentabilidad importante pero desde luego no es por lo que hemos luchado este tiempo ya que con el proceso la verdad se trata de una oportunidad nica para obtener algo intangible
1009425 si la acb vuelve a galicia no te preocupes que tendremos una afici n detr s

1009438 but once she read we all looked around at each other and said well theres no question
1009439 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1009440 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country

1009533 all 42 banks who are members of the azerbaijan banks association aba support the central banks decision as it is based on the national interests of azerbaijan

1009535 the central bank has recommended to banks working in azerbaijan that they stop using these systems for money transfers

1009558 led by marcus mumford this west london band peddle a sparkly breezy bluegrass infused folk pop thats similar to noah and the whale or at least what noah and the whale sounded like before they headed off in a more shiny pop direction
1009559 their music is euphoric emotive arresting and all the other good things you would imagine and if mumford amp sons can keep this up there should be plenty of excitement on the horizon
1009560 it is the presence the joy and the unbelievable talent of mumford amp sons that stops people in their step they represent a youthful spirit and communicate it with an intensity and integrity wise beyond their years

1009581 1 he was sigh a man who worked no more hours than his wife did but still expected her to cook and clean
1009582 before i met harry i was lonely bored and unhappy now im just bored and unhappy
1009583 so it wasnt just the man who was a lot of work the kids are too i think she is trying to convince herself that the divorce was a good move even though her heart tells a different story marriage should be forever but the single life isnt half bad for some reason women seem to be attracted to men having fun with their kids she may now realize that she drew the short straw
1009584 1 he was sigh a man who worked no more hours than his wife did but still expected her to cook and clean
1009585 well he wasnt a cop when we married he became one afterwards and since he got hired by the f b i he had to go wherever they sent him which was some state i dont remember all my family and friends are here and we lived here when we got married and i didnt sign on for that moving out of state

1009592 last night i slew my wife laid her out on the vinyl flooring it vexed me so to take her life but i had to stop her snoring
1009593 1 he was sigh a man who worked no more hours than his wife did but still expected her to cook and clean

1009601 because i would never say anything like that to a woman
1009602 i thought about killing him in his sleep im not even kidding i used to fantasize about smothering him with his pillow
1009603 im not about to defend women unless and until they start calling out their wretched sisters
1009604 it goes both ways what if i said im not about to defend men and male issues unless and until they start calling out their wretched brothers why should i criticize women on feminist blogs when i see exactly the same thing in mra blogs
1009605 my cat is at home because it cant protect me on the street
1009606 the dogs have pretty much given up on trying to get the cats to join in the play and seem to be having a good time without them
1009607 interesting no where in any of the comments did i see anyone mention they were a man
1009608 sex should be given freely but it should not be obligatory if the other person makes you angry or irritated why would you sleep with them its not really a punishment but more because you wouldnt feel like it
1009609 we also have several cats they dont play together theyve pretty much established their status structure but still often fight when one crosses anothers path
1009610 if the other person makes you angry or irritated why would you sleep with them
1009611 i refuse from now on to let you off the hook when you dodge or try one of your famous
1009612 cats i like because they are just honest about their indifference although i have had a few really affectionate cats who were like small lions who let you know they liked you but would prefer to eat you if they could
1009613 i dont know why its pathetic to not have sex if im not in the mood
1009614 i refuse from now on to let you off the hook when you dodge or try one of your famous
1009615 the dog fetches sticks so the mistress is in the mood to give him sticks
1009616 think most men are better off turning gay at this point with so many ungrateful women out there sigh i pray my son finds a good decent woman
1009617 dont any of you try anything or else the gets it
1009618 every day the bucket go to the well some day the bottom will drop out
1009619 the problem with that roy is that i havent figured out a way for me to take from those with abilities me to give to those with needs also me
1009620 so much of what schools do is based on trust not only must kids trust their teachers but parents have to trust those teachers too
1009621 and schools have to earn that trust each and every day
1009622 law journal fathers rights movement has spurred dads to fight for family leave

1009626 baskerville when abuse is alleged and judges award moms custody are they really erring on the side of caution
1009627 divorce sends many harmful messages to children and future citizens that we can break vows we make to god and others that family members may be discarded at will but among the most destructive are about the role of government that government is their de facto parent that may exercise unlimited power including remove and criminalize their real parent merely by claiming to act for their greater good no people can remain free who harbor within themselves a system of dictatorship or raise their children according to its principles
1009628 for whatever reason social conservatives focus considerable political effort on abortion gay rights and obscenity but pay scant attention to divorce
1009629 how can the judicial system be so abusive and callous to a man who stands for his country in harms way only to come home to false accussations being forced on him
1009630 judge cydfurhur thinks that only letting children see daddy 4 days a month is a good thing

1009634 i was thinking im going to have to take him out with a no hitter going in the seventh
1009635 i cant even remember it its been a long time
1009636 i dont know how it could have gone any better
1009637 when i first got called up in 05 but after the first inning it was going away that settled me down
1009638 first couple of pitches i throw a slider so i make him think im going to throw slider
1009639 he was pounding him in and then we went fastball away
1009640 it was probably a ball but it was close enough
1009641 his out pitch he can always go to is his slider and he can throw it over
1009642 we saw it a few times he still has a lot of faith in that slider
1009643 i caught his last start before he got sent down and its an amazing transformation
1009644 hes improved so much his arm strength isnt what it was in 2006 but he looked good he looked confident he was hitting the corners
1009645 sets up everything as long as hes able to pitch in and back hitters off the plate hes going to be successful
1009646 we know he can run the ball away but getting the ball in there as close as those were those were good pitches thats going to make hitters think that sets up the changeup and the little breaking ball i like the way he was coming in there backing hitters off
1009647 his velocitys not the same the sliders not the same but still hes better than most
1009648 well get him through this year let him pitch and everything may get even better next year
1009649 we showed that ade and i have a few nice combinations together
1009650 that is really important for two strikers you always have to work together you always have to look for each other hopefully this is a good start
1009651 i am getting better taking steps every day and i am really happy with how it is going
1009652 it is really important for me to get a good start which is why we are building everything up and we are two weeks on the way now
1009653 i learned a lot in the last two years because i have been injured so much

1009656 i just do not want to think about that negative stuff if you think positive you get positive

1009686 you have taxpayers subsidizing the risk takers mortgage lenders which i find unacceptable
1009687 the more i think back the more reasons i think of that i oppose this on
1009688 it actually undoes some of the risk lenders took when they loaned money to these people
1009689 the only way it will cost the taxpayers money will be if the renegotiated mortgages are defaulted on
1009690 as the homes are foreclosed on then no one pays property taxes

1009852 the chinese government was focused on rebuilding schools and communities
1009853 we saw that the devastation also extended to a lot of farms and small businesses and they needed money to rebuild
1009854 we stepped in with guarantees and technical advice for the banks on how to assess credit risks and set up lending criteria its a very good example of what the ifc does best
1009855 so we took a stake and sent in experts to improve their risk assessment and lending practices
1009856 the result was that over time they became credible banks and attractive to foreign banks so the ifc is now exiting those banks because weve played our role and made a profit on the way

1009867 we in the west have argued that markets are better at allocating capital efficiently and weve been listened to sometimes politely and sometimes not so politely now the wests model is in a state of turmoil some would say disarray
1009868 certainly some emerging economies are not going to run some of the risks they might have and you will see much tighter regulation for a period of time
1009869 one of the reasons that we in the west argue for this model is that it is easiest to get price mechanisms with market signals which is going to be the basis of our own carbon trading system
1009870 if china goes very slowly on that they may not have a compatible market based emissions system as soon as we would like them to have it
1009871 its urban regeneration projects are amongst the largest in the world the uk has a fundamental imbalance too many people with too few places to live

1009873 we assume things might drift down a little but were not assuming that we will have the sort of fundamental downturns the 20 30 reductions in house prices that weve seen in the uk and usa over the past few years

1009958 the movement of unprocessed scrap from generators to dealers generally works as follows the dealers submit bids to the generators for the purchase of unprocessed scrap during a specified time period at a set price in setting their bid price dealers consult various trade publications which report the prevailing prices that dealers can expect to charge users for the scrap after they have processed it to ensure that they turn a profit dealers set their bid price for the unprocessed scrap below the amount they will ultimately charge the users for the processed scrap if the bid is accepted by the scrap generator the generator and the dealer enter into a contract at the bid price for the bid period
