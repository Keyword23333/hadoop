2180006 we cannot therefore go along with people who openly claim that the workers are too ignorant to emancipate themselves but must first be emancipated from the top down by the philanthropic big and petty bourgeois
2180007 so far as we are concerned after our whole past only one way is open to us
2180008 while the democratic petty bourgeois is everywhere oppressed they preach to the proletariat general unity and reconciliation that is they seek to ensnare the workers in a party organization in which general social democratic phrases prevail while the specific demands of the proletariat may not be presented such a unity would to their complete disadvantage of the proletariat
2180009 if people of this kind from other classes join the proletarian movement the first condition is that they should not bring any remnants of bourgeois petty bourgeois etc
2180010 the democratic petty bourgeois far from wanting to transform the whole society in the interests of the revolutionary proletarians only aspire to a change in social conditions which will make the existing society as tolerable and comfortable for themselves as possible
2180011 the relationship of the revolutionary workers party to the petty bourgeois democrats is this it cooperates with them against the party which they aim to overthrow it opposes them wherever they wish to secure their own position
2180012 this proposition that the petty bourgeoisie is one reactionary mass is true only in certain exceptional instances for example
2180013 you banged me so hard you gave me a nosebleed

2180022 ada anak gantung diri karena masalah sepele ada orang saling menghujat antargolongan ada kecurigaan yang berlangsung ada beras yang tidak sampai ke penduduk miskin ada gagal panen yang memperparah keadaan jadi begitu banyak hal yang bisa diangkat dalam film
2180023 stigma kalau bukan hantu maka tidak laku kalau bukan film remaja maka tidak ada yang menonton itu bohong semua stigma itu diciptakan sendiri oleh orang film bukan oleh masyarakat
2180024 masyarakat memerlukan keberagaman informasi sehingga mereka bisa memilih kapan nonton film hantu kapan nonton film remaja dan kapan nonton film film bertema lain yang lebih menarik biarkan masyarakat yang memilih
2180025 diperlukan kesadaran masing masing karena saya tidak bisa mencampuri ruang kreatif orang persoalannya kita harus tanyakan pada diri sendiri kita membuat film untuk apa sebab setiap orang mempunyai motivasi yang berbeda beda

2180040 orlando fla the general managers meetings werent even 72 hours old and the suitors for marlins third baseman miguel cabrera were already lining up
2180041 theyre probably going to have to give up joba chamberlain phil hughes or ian kennedy in any package for cabrera
2180042 and the yankees have been steadfast since the july trade deadline they werent willing to part with their top pitching prospects
2180043 its pretty obvious which players were not going to trade
2180044 chamberlain hughes and even kennedy not for a position player
2180045 ive been tested on those guys this week and obviously the summer during the trade deadline and ill continue to be tested on it
2180046 i know that all three of those guys the 29 other clubs would have no problems pitching at least one of them if not all of them in their rotations
2180047 i have a pretty good idea going on as far as what potential options are
2180048 i know third base will not get solved all that soon for us
2180049 as time evolves i sense growing reluctance by teams to trade prospects
2180050 so we might see a revisionist approach with major leaguers for major leaguers trades being talked a lot
2180051 nobody cares in july about headlines you make in december

2180057 im going to be able to succeed where i failed last time
2180058 i have a strategy coming into the fight but its like when you play cards you dont want to show your hand but you can be sure i have something planned for him
2180059 the way i do it i try to think what is he going to plan to do and i do something to mess up his plan like a chess game and im very good at chess
2180060 im not going to let my opponent dictate my game plan im going to choose where the fight will go im going to take care of business
2180061 i will give this fight a pace a rhythm that hes not going to be able to keep up the whole fight and hes going to crash hes going to fail sooner or later
2180062 honey i am leaving tomorrow to go overseas i dont know how long i will be gone or exactly where i am going but i want you to know that i love you always

2180109 the brothel opened 20 years ago making it the newest and largest of the 14 recognised brothels in the country it is set on the meeting point of two vast rivers the jamuna and the ganges known locally as the padma which makes this a very busy place to catch a ferry trucks carrying rice jute sugar cane and fish from the west and south west of the country queue here for two or three days at a time to cross the river for the drive to the capital dhaka in bangladesh on a bbc world service boat to look at the impact of climate change i was surprised to find that an unexpected consequence of rising water levels is the growth in demand for prostitution river erosion has meant the closure of some ferry berths so men wait even longer to cross the river and while they wait many of them pass the time in the company of daulatdias women

2180114 you want to reduce the it costs you want to be able to access the browser from everywhere else in the world you want to have no need to upgrade and better collaboration
2180115 the big difference is bi uses data that is not owned by the bi application its produced in line of business systems inside the firewall
2180116 they needed to develop an analytical data engine in the cloud to take spreadsheet data into an olap environment that normally uses local computing power but in software as a service you dont have that luxury
2180117 normally they would have to buy sql server or oracle host it develop for it and upgrade and optimize the cube now they can hook into a transparent cloud based olap solution put the data in and get results out
2180118 this could be much bigger than powering our own solution
2180119 if im a cfo in a large enterprise i really couldnt care if its based in a cloud or in a relational database all i really want is the final result
2180120 you need to source the data find the data integrate the data and manage the data before you even get to modelling the data in an olap cube
2180121 it will be many years before all data is produced in the cloud it will continue to reside in data warehouses

2180130 i would answer back hard what do you mean hes not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
2180131 its barack obama who climbed up the hard way and thats why he wants middle class tax cuts and better schools for our kids
2180132 my experience with nuclear power goes back many years to being stationed onboard the uss
2180133 so obama will be jetting off to geneva switzerland to hob nob with the expats and raise a bundle of cash with the help of george clooney i guess thats what citizens of the world do the obama clooney pelosi marie antoinette democrats intend to maintain their lifestyles even as ordinary voters forfeit theirs at the pump and via massive government regulation

2180143 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2180144 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
2180145 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing
2180146 buckling down and pressing my secret to its fullest potential
2180147 well see just how long i can make it available before it saturates things
2180148 hes already so amazingly rich that whether he continues or discontinues its sale will neither make nor break the man but not grabbing it for yourself while its still available could prove disastrous for you as you may only have one chance and a very limited one at that to get this
2180149 if we dont get a great pitching performance it seems like we havent won we have to find a way to swing the bats a little bit better on the road score some runs we score two three four runs on the road whereas as at home were scoring five six seven runs
2180150 maybe were the sleeping giant were getting healthy too st louis certainly has a good ballclub and so do we and were getting kerry wood back and soriano is swinging the bat better and you can see how dangerous he is
2180151 because you want to get off to a good start
2180152 the world is a dangerous place to live not because of the people who are evil but because of the people who dont do anything about it
2180153 it would have been good to go out on the road riding that its the kind of game when if you could take two bad pitches back you would two mistakes two bad mistakes in key situations
2180154 we had a chance to get 13 games over 500 and were at 11 thats disappointing
2180155 we had a shot you dont see too many sweeps its hard its hard we took a shot ran into a very good pitcher
2180156 he doesnt drive in 100 how many guys every year by accident
2180157 hes one of those guys who doesnt miss that many you give him a cookie hes going to hit it i gave him an opportunity
2180158 if theres a guy on first usually albert is going to get pitched to
2180159 if i produce too then maybe they wont be reluctant to pitch to albert
2180160 that is the kind of thing this club has risen to the occasion all year i suspect we will again
2180161 now the fingering is like that because he wants you to play it that way not me but kreisler thats what you calll making music play it like he wants it to be played

2180166 our own medium is probably the most powerful tool that we can use to get the message out about what access television is what it can do and why it needs to be protected this is why massaccess has created its own monthly television show called masstalk weve named it the same as our newsletter to keep it to keep a consistency between our newsletter and this program our major tools of communication

2180174 no i dont like to read the paper online i am not a blogging type person are you pushing some online blog to me
2180175 it is not quick enough i am online all the time i can get my news when i want it i think that it is a bit out of date as a news piece
2180176 i am i cant think of the name right now
2180177 hmm good question i think i could as long as i knew it was not lying or facetious
2180178 i have no idea we would need to have rules
2180179 man i have not really thought about that i think we could do it
2180180 newspapers dont allow for recent real time public opinion and contribution
2180181 last friday something wonderful happened a story a full news story went live on the newton tab web site on a day the paper doesnt normally publish i talked with editor greg reibman today and he says more of that is coming the tab is going to start using its site a little more by posting stories from meetings etc not just on the blog but also on the main site this goes back to one of my criticisms of the local paper and media in general basically that i couldnt get regular local news updated when i needed it now i hope we can though greg does say that certain stories will wait until the published version of the paper since they want everyone to see the story at the same time the fact is no matter how technologically savvy some of us are many people in newton and the world still like having a paper in their hands that being said online people are still going to have the upper hand here a storys progression is likely to be from blog to online story to print
2180182 the most useful bit of the media is disappearing a cause for concern but not for panic

2180199 while many technologies to encrypt data exist implementing them incorrectly such as failing to properly configure the product secure encryption keys or train users can create a false sense of security and even render data permanently inaccessible
2180200 from july through september 2007 the major agencies collectively reported that they had not yet installed encryption technology to protect sensitive information on about 70 per cent of their laptop computers and handheld devices additionally agencies reported uncertainty regarding the applicability of ombs encryption requirements for mobile devices specifically portable media
2180201 six agencies reported having other storage devices such as portable storage media that could contain sensitive data of the six agencies four had not encrypted these additional devices further officials at one agency had no plans to encrypt sensitive data contained on their portable media
2180202 one thing that might be happening is that the departments are buying these products because they are fips validated but not understanding how to operate these products in a fips validated mode
2180203 you wouldnt necessarily understand how to do that unless you dug deeper into the security policies that accompany fips validation
2180204 some of these products also have software components and unless youre using those software components you may not be applying the proper security
2180205 this may be just because the user wasnt told how to use the device properly or that they know how to use it but they just didnt have the time to run the software which is quite often what happens when the security is a little cumbersome to use
2180206 one of the advantages of our technology is that we have full transparency in our encryption
2180207 so when you plug the device in you have no choice but to first of all authenticate to the device if you cant authenticate you cant use the device once youve authenticated your drive is fully encrypted no matter what you do theres no opportunity for the user to either accidentally or on purpose circumvent the security its so simple that the user cant make a mistake
2180208 the inanities of the internet have seduced a generation and we live in a fragmenting culture where people read nothing and know nothing of the world the new nobel laureate novelist doris lessing warned yesterday
2180209 we never thought to ask how will our lives our way of thinking be changed by the internet which has seduced a whole generation with its inanities so that even quite reasonable people will confess that once they are hooked it is hard to cut free and they may find a whole day has passed in blogging

2180212 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2180213 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2180214 our customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of itunes plus
2180215 we expect more than half of the songs on itunes will be offered in itunes plus versions by the end of this year
2180216 consumers are going to love listening to higher quality itunes plus tracks from their favorite emi artists with no usage restrictions
2180217 we also see it as a good place for postdocs and graduate students to get exposure and post information about their research
2180218 some people are asking why in world would i upgrade to 2008
2180219 with this feature we extended connectivity to heterogeneous data sources like oracle teradata and sap netweaver
2180220 microsoft continues to demonstrate that its really buying into this co opetition model as opposed to trying to freeze other people out
2180221 the majority of corporate buyers first and foremost want to see how the database be it sql or any other kind of database integrates with other applications being used in the business
2180222 that plug and play status has been the nirvana for companies businesses are complex places and its been a goal thats been difficult to achieve in the past
2180223 we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love
2180224 one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme
2180225 that was probably the most important step internally as well as externally to say that we screwed up
2180226 in their post event examination they identified that there was at least some problems with former leadership at mobileme
2180227 eddy has shown with itunes over the years that hes very good at running a 24 7 worldwide distribution point hes got some serious chops and the appointment is interesting
2180228 i think apple may have to consider broadly beta testing with services in the cloud like mobileme
2180229 what customers really want is that same flexibility they get with the network and they want it in the computing realm as well
2180230 as we approach fridays opening ceremony in beijing they obviously are going to see a spike in traffic and they are looking for the ability to burst similar to the network burst on the computing side as well
2180231 the one thing we have is an ownership of the network and how to leverage that
2180232 for them and for us the cloud is our network
2180233 its all about building this service and again this is really the starting point for us on some level and having this service converge with our network service
2180234 classic almost cloud type service to offer across the network
2180235 so when youre guaranteeing service you can offer enterprise grade level agreements
2180236 on that score i dont know if it would be that different than from google or someone else
2180237 infrastructure as a service all the way up to software as a service and it can be anywhere in between depending on who you are its a very buzz word phrase right now
2180238 for us right now its all about the network for us and thats what we perceive as ultimately the differentiator
2180239 throwing in virtualization so that services are hosted in essence in a cloud and they can make them more expandable and scalable benefits of cloud computing

2180243 while the democratic petty bourgeois is everywhere oppressed they preach to the proletariat general unity and reconciliation that is they seek to ensnare the workers in a party organization in which general social democratic phrases prevail while the specific demands of the proletariat may not be presented such a unity would to their complete disadvantage of the proletariat
2180244 if people of this kind from other classes join the proletarian movement the first condition is that they should not bring any remnants of bourgeois petty bourgeois etc

2180249 there are a lot of things i enjoy that dont exist anymore
2180250 i find myself drawn to things that no longer exist that are worth saving
2180251 i kind of have this view of the 1950s as the epitome of consumerism and commercialism
2180252 the economy was prosperous everybody was happy there were bad things that happened but they were swept under the rug everybody was happy whether they liked it or not
2180253 in one one hundredth of a second my brain worked and said youre interested in the sideshow thing lie
2180254 and so i immediately said yes i am a sideshow performer
2180255 i had 10 days to become a sideshow performer and i did
2180256 ive been blown up twice had my face burned off twice

2180267 to pay back lenders early and to cancel its pittsburgh area casino development
2180268 the three commissioners are watching this issue very closely we are hopeful the end result will be a positive one for both centaur and lawrence county
2180269 theyre feeling the pressure from the hedge funds involved these hedge funds are proactive
2180270 that caught some lenders off guard and gave them less confidence in the deal
2180271 the delays by pennsylvania regulators have raised eyebrows back in indiana given that this seemed to be a strong proposal that was fully financed and was ready to go
2180272 the only question seemed to be why the regulators were not willing to advance things
2180273 this doesnt come as a surprise to me its one of the reasons i went public a couple of weeks ago
2180274 i believe that i could secure a gaming operator that has already been through the feasibility process in pennsylvania
2180275 we are in the process of building a strong campaign organization the size and scope of which this state has never seen before
2180276 these 29 field offices are in every region of the state including towns that have never seen a presidential campaign office before
2180277 the interviews are diametrically different in regard to the use of the taser as opposed to stepping on his neck and punching him
2180278 what dr williams has been able to tell me is there is no trauma to the neck or the head which is consistent with the type of beating a very violent beating a repeated use of the foot feet or punching around the head or neck
2180279 were anxious to get as much information as we can from as many people as we can
2180280 help me they are trying to kill me they are trying to shoot me
2180281 she orders him down on the ground he initially goes down she unholsters her taser he after some amount of time starts to get up
2180282 we intend to consult with the fbi about this too hes not a criminal based upon his conduct that evening people thought he was dangerous but as far as im concerned i would not charge him with a crime
2180283 more dramatic so initially it could be one punch the second time its repeatedly punch the third time more than one officer did in fact punch this guy
2180284 ive already seen that this was going to get nasty theyre trying to squash my credibility
2180285 a couple of times they would just sort of reach down and touch him gently
2180286 thats about all i saw i didnt see any kicking or hitting
2180287 we will probably be engaging in advocacy fund raising to some extent
2180288 but its not a sexy issue like lets have a drink and go fight the drink tax
2180289 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
2180290 i would vote for it but if you take a look behind the curtain you have to do something else
2180291 i cant imagine a property attorney whos not going to take this side
2180292 a lazy hazy summer no way we go for structure
2180293 after my story was published i expected a call or two from relatives but that evening i received a call from a complete stranger pat mangold fitzgerald
2180294 her family had a cottage in the same location she even remembered my aunts we laughed and cried as we were able to share so many of the same memories
2180295 she had been able to find the cottages several years ago and found them abandoned wood rotting overgrown with foliage their cottage had even slipped into the creek
2180296 im lucky i was unable to find the road when i went looking for it a few years ago

2180315 traditional literacy and research skills are no longer sufficient we should no longer consider young people to be media literate if they can consume but not produce media its like confusing penmanship with composition

2180321 regionalism is the only way we will be able to compete in a global economy
2180322 that is the essence of our motivation to act and think differently
2180323 parts working together in harmony is an apt description of the communities of the detroit region when we are at our very best
2180324 the way we pulled together for last years super bowl is just one recent example but that was an effort built around an occasion for the communities of regional detroit to shine their brightest we need more than an occasional effort we need to embrace regionalism we need to make it a way of life
2180325 there needs to be a way for the other organizations to engage with one d
2180326 all of those organizations need to make sure were all working from a complimentary playbook
2180327 one d is built on two pretty simply pinnacles its essential the region stands above any one municipality the region has to be whats looked at as what is best for the region
2180328 secondly all of us will learn to think that way
2180329 regionalism is a necessity if we are going to quickly emerge from the business malaise were experiencing we are only going to be successful as a region
2180330 i dont see it yet and what im hoping to see is people acting speaking regionally
2180331 deliberate in effort to not try to plan for everyone in the region
2180332 work in the past on regionalism has tended to gravitate toward win lose scenarios one community benefits at the expense of another
2180333 that is a reason why this initiative can work so well all priorities benefit the entire region they certainly dont hurt anyone
2180334 right now what were trying to get across is we havent had anything like this before this is a big first step for the region

2180341 if the arctic experiences a normal decline rate the minimum extent will be between the second lowest extent which occurred in 2005 and the third lowest extent which occurred in 2002 even at a rate one standard deviation faster than normal the extent will not fall below last years minimum so it appears unlikely that we will set a new record low

2180354 tahukah anda sekalian mengapa aku memanggil kalian karena aku ingin mendengar langsung dari kalian apa yang pernah kalian lakukan terhadap sesama kalian saat kalian hidup sebagai pemimpin dan berkuasa dahulu
2180355 jadi aku minta satu per satu kalian menceritakan segala hal tentang peristiwa perisiiwa pembantaian itu
2180356 hal itu saya lakukan untuk membersihkan bangsa khmer dari virus pikiran jahat kaum borjuis kecil tuan tanah dan bangsawan khmer
2180357 ehem terima kasih atas kesempatan yang diberiken daripada yang mulia rasul kepada saya
2180358 saya tidak aken bercerita panjang lebar seperti anda anda sekalian anda anda bercerita dengan rasa bang ga yang besar di hadapan daripada yang mulia rasul paulus seolah olah andalah yang terhebat dan terbesar dalam urusan daripada bantai membantai sesama umat manusia
2180359 begini saja daripada yang mulia rasul paulus kelebihan daripada hitler adalah membunuhi jutaan orang yang kemudian dapat diketahui persis berapa jumlah korbannya dan berasal dari kamp kamp konsentrasi mana mayat mayat itu berasal tapi ia sendiri hingga kini tidak diketahui dimana daripada kuburnya berada hitler masih jadi misteri jangankan kuburnya bahkan apakah ia mati bunuh diri atau tidak semua masih misteri
2180360 nero betapa pun hebatnya para sejarawan berabad abad kemudian dapat mengkisahken dan mengungkap sedetil detilnya daripada peristiwa roma lautan api dengan baik bahken sudah difilmken toh
2180361 pol pot okelah kelebihannya bahwa ia dapat daripada bersembunyi di hutan puluhan tahun tapi bukankah ladang pembantaian itu dapat dibongkar dan diketahui oleh rezim sesudah pol pot dunia internasional mengetahui hal itu dan kalau tidak salah daripada yang mulia bukankah juga sudah difilmken oleh sutradara amerika yang orangnya juga ada disini
2180362 kalian mati atau menghilang boleh secara misterius tapi korban korban kalian kan kemudian dapat diketahui kuburnya atau keberadaannya kalau saya yang mulia bukanlah saya yang jadi misterius tapi korban korban inilah yang jadi misterius tidak jelas daripada dimana jasadnya berada dan dengan cara apa dan bagaimana mereka dilenyapkan
2180363 omong omong kalau daripada yang mulia sepakat tolong sampaikan ke boss besar yang dimaksud soeharto adalah tuhan yme bahwa saya bisa membantu beliau untuk memberi tip cara melenyapkan manusia manusia terhukum di hari kiamat ini
2180364 being a consultant in marketing and advertising with my company senioragency i would like to start with a little story about consultants to indicate the situation imagine that its not 9 15 in the morning but its 5 o clock in the morning and we are not in maastricht but in

2180376 we have been very clear with the indians that the permanence of the safeguards is permanence of the safeguards without condition in fact we reserve the right should india test as it has agreed not to or should india violate in any way iaea safeguard agreement to which it would be adhering that the deal from our point of view would at that point be off
2180377 i propose to approach this task not in a partisan manner but in as objective a manner as fair a manner as possible and i expect that those who will respond from the governments side will also keep this in mind and respond to our concerns taking this as an issue of supreme national importance
2180378 if the present crisis is the greatest that we have faced since independence it is because successive governments in the eighties chose to abdicate their responsibilities to the nation for the sake of short term partisan political gains and indeed out of sheer political cynicism
2180379 the chandrashekhar government began to behave more responsibly than most people had expected

2180527 i was just really shocked i was waiting for her to say twitchs name because i knew a lot of people love twitch
2180528 it was really just overwhelming and i was really just overjoyed i was so happy
2180529 we always hoped that we would win but you never really know if you would
2180530 i would always hope but it was so crazy in a way kind of i didnt expect to but i would always hope for the best
2180531 i was really a sports fan i would always run track and i was the varsity running back in high school
2180532 i would play sports mostly dance wasnt that big for me i was really a sports person
2180533 i took modern class i took ballet classes and i took some jazz classes but i wasnt technically trained like fellow finalists william wingfield mark kanemura and matt dorame i just took class and i knew what everything was
2180534 i didnt want to go into the competition dumbfounded and act like i didnt know what nothing was i felt like if you want to be a well rounded dancer than you should know a lot of different styles of dance so i took classes but i wasnt a technically trained dancer
2180535 were just really cool friends when we get onstage were really not ourselves we tap into that person that were supposed to be portraying i think thats why we were such a good couple we would literally go and be that person we were supposed to be
2180536 it was really just committing a lot so i think that helped us a lot
2180537 weve been through a lot together we struggled through a lot of stuff
2180538 we dont get the dances perfect every time just going through being frustrated about not getting the dance the way we wanted even the little things weve been through a lot just the competition
2180539 i was so so so happy for her i was so happy for her
2180540 i didnt want her to walk away empty handed she wasnt going to walk away empty handed period but i just really wanted her to have something and walk away with something
2180541 we do dance a lot of hours and it wasnt that big of a deal
2180542 we really thought we were okay and were fine now we just really forgot to drink and replenish our bodies because we were so concentrated on having such a good show and doing such a good job but everything is fine though
2180543 we were really happy with the performance given the fact that we were in the hospital the night before
2180544 we were expecting to do a hip hop number and when we got there we were like oh my god how can we pull this off is it going to be as good as people want it to be we really wanted hip hop but when we got this we were like we have to make due with it it came off really good we did really good i felt we had fun
2180545 whenever you feel like youre exhausted and you cant give anymore you have a lot more to give
2180546 the show pushes you that hard we didnt know our limits and this show pushes you to your limit and it doesnt except anything less than your best im such more of a better dancer now than i was before i started the competition its ridiculous
2180547 so the next day i went at like 6am got them off and got my retainers i was so happy i was licking my teeth the whole time it was cool and it made me feel a lot more confident in my smile because sometime i would be nervous to smile
2180548 im going to invest it and save it and try to make it grow so i can be comfortable in the near future
2180549 i know its a really good impact dance movie im really excited
2180550 not in a million years did i think i was going to be on step up 3d i always hoped but i never thought id be doing it so this is such a blessing for me

2180552 i havent been a lot of different other places so this is going to be so cool to go to all these different other cities

2180600 require nothing more than treating skid marks disease by making the streets skid proof
2180601 we can treat this skid marks disease by coating the roads with teflon
2180602 the streets will then be skid proof and all the traffic accidents will cease
2180603 this disease was invented by the roadaceuticals company to sell you teflon coatings
2180604 all we need to do is build stop signs and traffic lights then the traffic accidents will cease
2180605 but how can we afford stop signs weve spent all our money on teflon treatments
2180606 and how can we stop anyway the streets are all coated with teflon if we build stop signs well waste all the money weve spent on teflon
2180607 but the stop signs will eliminate the need for teflon people will be able to stop their cars and accidents will cease the solution is simple
2180608 if we build these stop signs and traffic accidents go down ill have to fire most of my workers

2180610 do you ever put your arms out and just spin and spin and spin well thats what love is like everything inside of you tells you to stop before you fall but you just keep going
2180611 you cant make someone love you all you can do is be someone who can be loved the rest is up to the person to realize your worth
2180612 i came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible
2180613 i love that you get cold when its seventy degrees out i love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich i love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when youre looking at me like im nuts i love that after i spend a day with you i can still smell your perfume on my clothes and i love that you are the last person i want to talk to before i go to sleep at night
2180614 in my opinion the best thing you can do is to find a person who loves you for exactly who you are good mood bad mood ugly pretty handsome what have you the right person will still think that the sun shines out your ass thats the kind of person thats worth sticking with
2180615 me im scared of everything im scared of what i saw im scared of what i did of who i am and most of all im scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life the way i feel when im with you
2180616 love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with i say fall head over heels find someone you love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart

2180665 cultural rights like human rights in general are based mainly on natural law philosophy enhancing the individual rights that every person deserves wherever they are

2180700 and make a significant step toward energy independence lets investigate
2180701 the key to this approach is that the alternatives must deliver when they are needed and they must cover severe shortfalls what if they dont
2180702 end of the day were talking about 1 5 million barrels per day in an 86 0 million barrels per day world
2180703 but they should be liable as hell if anything goes wrong
2180704 thats why nearly every nuclear power program in the world is operated by a federal monopoly
2180705 50 billion barrels of oil and as much as 90 billion
2180706 environmentalists argue nuclear is too expensive and takes too long because environmentalists file lawsuits that make it very expensive and delay construction
2180707 plan b is coal coal fired power coal based liquid fuels

2180709 and once nat gas goes into depletion with nuclear off the table well
2180710 china is building coal plants like crazy in fact theyre planning to do ctl as well betcha anything we start exporting coal to them
2180711 the 2007 chevrolet volt concept vehicle that appeared in the detroit auto show 16 introduced the e flex 17 drive system which is an attempt to standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity generating systems the initial design as envisioned in the volt combines an electric motor and 16 kwh 58 mj lithium ion battery plug in system 18 with a small engine 1 liter powered by gasoline linked to a 53 kw 71 hp generator the vehicle is propelled by an electric motor with a peak output of 120 kw 160 hp ordinarily the vehicle would be charged while at home overnight plug in hybrid the vehicle has two charging ports for convenience one on each side 19 a full charge reportedly takes 6 5 hours from a standard north american 120 v 15 a household outlet
2180712 i am puzzled as to why people think opening new leases will actually solve anything
2180713 adding some 1 5 of the daily world use production isnt going to change the open market price significantly
2180714 any demand that it be kept in the us and sold for less is a fools hope
2180715 what oil company would spend a bazillion dollars drilling for oil off california under those conditions if it could spend the same bazillion dollars and drill off africa or wherever without such strings
2180716 but deep water drill ships arent made in the us
2180717 and the profits go to exxon et al and like exxon is a us owned company what ever that means not
2180718 i just dont see any logic in the argument that more drilling will solve our energy problem
2180719 so everybody wastes a whole bunch of effort time and money on a solution that really isnt a solution

2180724 you dont even have to have a talent to be famous look at paris hilton i mean she doesnt do anything
2180725 yeah that lasted for what three days what a joke some mysterious illness and now shes out like jail was just another come and go rehab center
2180726 who cares by now we should get some hits in the search engines and blog feeds
2180727 good point wanna go get some heroin and shoot paintballs at catholics
2180728 you read my mind whichever one of us you are
2180729 emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the earths climate
2180730 opinions expressed are those of the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the aps or of the forum
2180731 co2 is being used here in japan 1 as a way for corporations to push all sorts of
2180732 the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
2180733 you dont really need any training commmon sense will suffice
2180734 temperatures in the last half of a century tend to be hotter than the first primarily because of sunspot cycles back in the 70s the fear was of an impending ice age
2180735 a greenhouse traps heat but the earths atmosphere isnt a greenhouse even if a region could retain more heat throughout the summer theres nothing preventing that excessive heat from escaping during winter months
2180736 the scientific debate has been conducted in science journals over the past 30 years and is more or less done
2180737 sunspot numbers over the past 11 400 years have been reconstructed using dendrochronologically dated radiocarbon concentrations the level of solar activity during the past 70 years is exceptional the last period of similar magnitude occurred over 8 000 years ago
2180738 i advised pew that pew should be in the background and by law the grantees always have to disclose but i always encouraged the grantees never to mention pew
2180739 did we push the envelope yeah were we encouraged internally to push the envelope yeah we stayed with the letter if not the spirit of the law
2180740 if congress thought this was a pew effort itd be worthless
2180741 to convey the impression that this was something coming naturally from beyond the beltway
2180742 my point is this it may well be that human activity is indeed changing the climate at least in part but there is an increasing body of science that says that the sun may have a greater role if it does have then global warming is likely to stop as it appears to have done since 1998 and if the current sunspot cycle fails to ignite then cooling possibly rapid and severe cooling may eventuate the next five years will tell us a great deal in these circumstances we should wait and see
2180743 the real explaination as i keep hammering away is that there are more variables involved
2180744 if theres no natural explanation it stands to reason that the temperature increase is caused by humans
2180745 the climate is so complex that we shouldnt even attempt to understand it
2180746 the climate is so simple that if it cant be explained in 1 variable then that variable cant have any impact
2180747 volcanoes cause more co2 ozone destruction sulfur dioxide than man

2180859 this is probably the most significant vulnerability that affects the entire internet that weve ever seen and certainly the biggest one weve seen in 10 or 11 years
2180860 it sort of creates a man in the middle attack opportunity they can hijack the domain name or the url for a secure site and reroute it to different site the end user would see that the certificate is not signed or the certificates invalid or something like that but most certificate end users ignore that
2180861 if youre an enterprise or financial institution or anyone who accepts payments or uses ssl certificates for security then you absolutely need to hound your sip and make them prove to you that they have in fact patched the vulnerability

2180863 even if youve applied the patch your firewall still could still be limiting the traffic to a single port
2180864 once the patch has been applied and source ports are being randomized an attack would generate enough traffic to grab somebodys attention

2180872 i am celebrating international womens day by not going to work
2180873 who cares about work i want to know about your flower garden
2180874 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
2180875 but i feel like it actually decreases the quality of games because people spend so much of their energy on these things that users dont even really care about
2180876 what would keep me from putting another game on arcade again is just that theyve changed the business deal at least as ive heard
2180877 if its as ive heard that it is i couldnt even necessarily break even
2180878 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2180879 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2180880 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2180881 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2180882 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2180883 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2180884 yeah so i got robbed on the express in broad daylight

2180920 it only 9 a m and i have already had more than my share of lessons
2180921 theres no doubt about it the black community has been sluggish in adapting to new technologies
2180922 it and engineers tend to be predominantly european and asian you dont see a lot of brothers and sisters in there
2180923 the african american community needs to come to the math and engineering sciences in general and we need to get them a lot earlier like in elementary school
2180924 i ask them do you know what a supersoaker is and then when they say yeah i tell them that it was invented by a black nasa scientist
2180925 a fun and lively presentation on what does and doesnt work in the online social media world addressing best practices and worst mistakes and if you do screw up how do you fix things and recover and shhh is it worth doing stupid things to just garner attention maybe
2180926 traditionally we talk about two primary uses of technology in schools the administrative use and the students use
2180927 but theres another area that weve started to focus on the teachers use of computers the use of technology as a learning tool
2180928 the initiative isnt so much about technology per se but about where technology can take you
2180929 we call todays kids the muchmusic generation theyre used to a media rich environment and when they come into the classroom you need to be engaging some of these kids are visual learners they dont get it until they see it and particularly for those learners this initiative has made a huge difference
2180930 teachers have access to all sorts of visuals for the students in pretty much every area
2180931 the teaching with technology initiative brings the learning to life because kids can see what youre talking about and they can share their answers with the class when theyve written something in their books you can stick it under the document camera put it up on the screen and show the whole class what their answer was that helps the kids feel more part of the class
2180932 i was talking about it with laura williams one day when a grade five student walked by
2180933 no insult mrs k i but when thats on i pay attention
2180934 when i put my hand on the bible i will swear to not to uphold the laws of the land
2180935 our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we they never stop thinking of new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we
2180936 liberty i mean library i mean bank towers in los angeles
2180937 i remember getting a call from the er fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire and i said
2180938 weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it and they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse
2180939 its tough as heck in iraq right now because people are trying to stop democracy thats what youre seeing and iraqis are losing lives and so are some of our soldiers and it breaks my heart to see the loss of innocent life and to see brave troops in combat lose their life it just breaks my heart but i understand whats going on these people are trying to shake the will of the iraqi citizens and they want us to leave thats what they want us to do and i think the world would be better off if we did leave if we didnt if we left the world would be worse the world is better off with us not leaving its a mistake to pull out
2180940 if youve retired you dont have anything to worry about third time ive said that laughter ill probably say it three more times
2180941 they looked at the same intelligence i did and they voted many of them voted to support the decision i made its irresponsible to use politics
2180942 i think if you know what you believe it makes it a lot easier to answer questions i cant answer your question
2180943 there is no doubt in my mind that we will fail
2180944 one of the hardest parts of my job is to connect iraq to the war on terror
2180945 freedom is about authority freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do
2180946 the major function of secrecy in washington is to keep the u s people from knowing what the nations leaders are doing
2180947 i have an entire class of absurd seventh grade students in my homeroom right now when i repeatedly told them the only thing they are allowed to do is read someone had the great idea to say look at her in spanish so for a period of time i had at least nine students just staring at me what the heck am i supposed to do with that you should know that before this i tried to tell them you are what you repeatedly do and if you do good things over and over you are good if you do stupid things over and over you are stupid thats when i got an entire class of oooooohs they apparently took that as me calling them stupid was i i didnt mean to say they were i just meant to say they make stupid choices and they appear stupid i think they just wanted something to use against me did i do something wrong
2180948 every day you come to class i am ready to teach you you must be ready to succeed as learners in this classroom its ok to fail as long as you try again if you fail and only give up all you have is failure you are to be trying to succeed as readers in class today i am ready when you are
2180949 what if we all got along amp people loved each other amp sang songs about peace he said would that be a good world amp i said i didnt know about that but it would be a good summer camp amp he looked at me amp shook his head amp said its no wonder youre leaving us with such a mess
2180950 we continue to be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2180951 well now you get to do something else with your summer
2180952 because i dont want to fail i failed already and i dont want to do it anymore
2180953 because i want to be successful in here its like a family me and shantrell and rayven sit together for our book clubs and its safe we read and get work done when were not in class its different but when were in here its like a family and its ok

2180958 before you get settled in though it seems we have a problem you see strangely enough weve never once had a human resources manager make it this far and were not really sure what to do with you
2180959 well id like to but i have higher orders what were going to do is let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in
2180960 actually i think ive made up my mind i prefer to stay in heaven
2180961 so youve spent a day in hell and youve spent a day in heaven now you must choose your eternity
2180962 well i never thought id say this i mean heaven has been really great and all but i think i had a better time in hell
2180963 yesterday i was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable

2180966 we have come here today to speak out against the human rights abuses of the chinese government
2180967 we have come here today to be a voice to those who are in prison because of their religious beliefs we are here to peacefully pray
2180968 the premise of this prosecution is that words have power
2180969 the images conjured by ms fletchers words are as horrifying or more horrifying than any photographs or videos of child pornography which can be seen on the internet
2180970 the individuals willing to pay money to subscribe to this web site clearly have a very strong sexual interest in children not just a sexual interest but a violent sexual interest
2180971 in my stories i have created new monsters they rise above the horror of the real life monsters
2180972 somehow making these monsters so much worse makes me feel better and makes my life seem more bearable
2180973 i may still be afraid of the monsters but at least in the stories they prey on someone else not me
2180974 i recognized that i didnt have to be afraid of rejection because i was hiding behind the anonymity of the internet
2180975 instead of being rejected the response was supportive and some individuals even said that my stories helped them i felt safer here than at any other time in my life
2180976 if anyone would have read the story and acted upon it a little child could have suffered devastation that you would have had to live with for the rest of your life

2180981 when you look at their commercial ratings theyre really in a deep hole
2180982 those years when mtv could command whatever they wanted and get it they just dont exist anymore
2180983 were having some minute by minute ratings discussions with some vendors
2180984 cable is clearly where they need the financial incentive to clean up their act
2180985 mtv right now still has some relatively long commercial pods and they still keep a majority of their a positions for promos
2180986 the days when this business was conducted over a couple of weeks and into the wee hours of the morning are history that will not replicate itself in my lifetime its a different business
2180987 our mind is all weve got not that it wont lead us astray sometimes but we still have to analyze things out within ourselves
2180988 all this just dont seem real my sons an honor roll student i give him everything i spoil him i dont see why he would need to rob anybody
2180989 from gold chains to earrings i give him everything he wants i wont have to worry about him selling drugs
2180990 he didnt seem out of the ordinary he wasnt shaky he keeps himself clean and the clothes he had on were spotless he had on a white t shirt and white sneakers
2180991 there were so many people lying on the ground covering the street even among those who were barely walking some had burned clothes on most were naked there were also those whose eyes had been blown out of their sockets by the bomb blast
2180992 the rivers running through the city were also filled with corpses many of them were those who had jumped into the river to escape from the fire or to cool down their burns only to drown
2180993 what were trying to do is make a strong statement that we remember the devastation and what we want is a world of peace
2180994 the idea is to show graphically and make people think about the black rain that fell in hiroshima and nagasaki after the bombings
2180995 we want to draw attention to peace and the abolition of not exclusively nuclear warfare but to war in general
2180996 a strike would cause irreparable harm to people who rely on transit to get to work or to their doctor to employers and to the transit system

2181002 by managements own admission merchant bankers have not been appointed for the ipo so how has the price been established and announced
2181003 declaring a price range without the requisite due diligence or engagement with merchant bankers is a reckless move
2181004 this low share price is extremely damaging for bsnl and should invite the regulators scrutiny
2181005 the logical route for any company looking to raise funds is to restructure its operations to create maximum shareholder value and appoint merchant bankers before going to the market
2181006 bsnl is the indian public sectors crowning glory it has played a historic role in connecting the unconnected in the remotest regions of the nation to engage in a speculative share price discussion can seriously undermine investor sentiment bsnl deserves better
2181007 any move to bypass substantial objections by the unions or distract us with esop lollypops will fail this is a very serious matter and requires very serious engagement
2181008 arguments that an ipo will bring transparency or improve stock market sentiment are bogus it implies that the current leadership is not transparent moreover why should bsnl be used as a guinea pig to improve market sentiment

2181018 since theyve come to seattle this is really the first incident and certainly the first fatality connected to pedicabs
2181019 were as interested in getting to the bottom of this situation as anyone
2181020 on a regular bike stopping power down a hill can be pretty hard sometimes but going down a grade that steep is just retarded
2181021 why would a pedicab be coming down cedar a dinky bike with 3 adults on it
2181022 when going down cedar on our mountain bikes well sometimes walk it because of traffic and the hill that seems messed up especially when the pedicab driver is responsible for the passengers as well
2181023 this is the first time ive ever heard of a pedicab fatality
2181024 ive seen all these birds in my yard or the school yard
2181025 this is a terrible example for the students of the city

2181054 there was no evidence in general no evidence of excessive force being used
2181055 i cant get down to the specifics of what we did or did not find in the autopsy
2181056 its more of like a passive investigation where well gather police reports and newspaper accounts we will be monitoring the county investigation
2181057 in a progressive society the people cannot allow overzealous poorly trained police officers to commit murder against innocent citizens
2181058 we demand that the officers involved in the death of andre thomas be relieved of duty until a complete investigation has been conducted
2181059 no comment regarding this case will come from this council due to the fact that the incident you are referring to is under investigation by the county police and district attorneys office
2181060 the legislative accomplishments and unabashed energy that rep deweese has brought to harrisburg for over three decades cannot be questioned as well as his leadership in enacting important legislative reform laws that have changed how the house operates
2181061 although bill deweese has not been charged with any crime and has fully cooperated with the attorney general in the investigation a systematic inexcusable and indefensible violation of the public trust occurred on his watch
2181062 were suggesting its in everyones best interest to get pat back to work expeditiously the city is paying him and he ought to be working
2181063 the idea here is to get a decent public servant back to serving the public
2181064 weve waited this long to pass judgment and until i hear back officially from the commission well reserve judgment
2181065 but i will say its in everybodys best interest to try to bring this issue to closure and if mr fishers statements yesterday were accurate the ethics board will communicate that to us in the very near future and then the ura board will make a decision obviously with input from myself as well
2181066 has received assurances from authorities that his cooperation with them is of mutual interest
2181067 pittsburghs a distressed city and were giving away our prime riverfront property
2181068 this is not something that this group is prepared to offer at this point
2181069 we want to take a thoughtful approach without feeling that were pressed to act with some sense of urgency
2181070 we feel like a lot of this we received in the 11th hour and were asked to put forth enabling legislation we owe it to our constituents to make sure that whether its the municipal government or city residents theyre actually informed
2181071 do we need two economic development agencies do we need all of these different planning authorities
2181072 i think that clearly around the table here there are a wide range of views beyond that one expressed and recommended in the nordenberg report
2181073 believes a full consolidation of city and county government is the best choice for residents
2181074 we heard loud and clear at public hearings that people didnt want to see local or long distance diversions to local roads
2181075 we believe this plan favorably addresses some of the concerns
2181076 this continues to be a classical case of robbing peter to pay paul ripping the carpet out from underneath rural pennsylvania to better serve more affluent communities
2181077 i heard a crack and i thought it was a car backfire
2181078 i was scared the minute a co worker said there was a gunman out there
2181079 as soon as i heard the robbery report i was guessing it was related
2181080 we have a group of bank robbers out there and theyre shooting and we have to get them off the streets
2181081 this is ligonier pennsylvania a great place to live and raise a family
2181082 there were so many people involved with this somebody out there must know something
2181083 we believe the state is very committed to the direction we are taking
2181084 how do we ever get the state to realize that
2181085 we are at a fairly early stage of this but there are areas of the iranian economy that are vulnerable to targeted sanctions whether they be in the lng liquefied natural gas sector investment in the oil and gas sector imported refined products reinsurance other financial areas which are areas we would look at if we are looking to increase the pressure on the iranian leadership
2181086 a number of other countries that we would want to involve in those discussions as we go forward
2181087 no illusions that it will be difficult as it was last time to actually agree the text of some tough sanctions in the security council
2181088 we have said we will continue looking to see how best to apply pressure to the iranian regime and we will continue to do that
2181089 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2181090 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2181091 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage
2181092 to renounce violence and participate peacefully in the iraqi political process
2181093 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
2181094 if we find this does not happen and the u s forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also
2181095 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on the ground
2181096 my neighbours were having a wedding children from all around came to listen to the music and dance in the street
2181097 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2181098 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
2181099 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armoured vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2181100 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate ceasefire
2181101 about 1 400 died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
2181102 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2181103 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
2181104 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives

2181106 the role of the federal government in improving secondary education should be one of the major issues in the presidential campaign but its not the u s has stopped dealing honestly with difficult and complex problems politicians and not just john mccain by any means spin fantasies of a wondrous cost free future no investment and no sacrifice necessary

2181124 on the other hand there are no winners here he was not a nice guy
2181125 this was just a slight social interaction that i think he would have liked to see as a long term friendship and i didnt
2181126 he denied it but there was no question it was he
2181127 he was really good at snooping even in the 1980s
2181128 he knew quite a lot about me without me telling him
2181129 he knew my sons names and their years in school
2181130 trophy hunters do not go after the very rare cougar that is causing a problem
2181131 our frustration is that we see plenty of prime time tv shows depicting marijuana use in a humorous light yet when we produce a half hour program designed to take a serious look at our marijuana laws and their impact on our communities we cant get any airtime
2181132 we dont use our public airways to promote illegal things

2181167 when i went in a month ago a second station had fallen and was in pieces each of these sections of plaster is going to continue to fall like dominoes the inside of the church is just literally crumbling
2181168 when i went inside of there there wasnt even a musty smell some plaster had fallen because of a clogged gutter but that was about it you could have held mass in there if you wanted
2181169 its been 21 years i think it would have collapsed by now if it were going to collapse

2181177 we are cleaning our bridges once a year getting underneath and cleaning salt and debris from birds we are doing more vegetation removal to keep channels open and clean and keep the water flowing
2181178 we have rededicated ourselves to bridges over the last year

2181189 all these stories sound so familiar the landing crafts were on the bottom end when it came to getting proper supplies a lot of times they did without
2181190 he told me the crew liked me which i could never be sure of
2181191 you havent lived until youve kissed a horse on the lips
2181192 they never really bothered me there were a couple smart alecks
2181193 it was scary it made me feel real nervous but at the same time very excited the owner put me on my first horse which was a plug
2181194 i was noted as a front rider because i had a clock in my head and i could get out of the gate and sit there and relax
2181195 i won the first race i ever ran there if you bet 2 on me you made 95 and i was a star
2181196 fulfillment becoming one with the horse and the exuberance of riding on the back of a horse that accomplishes something that you are striving for
2181197 i flew off i just got back on i lost control of my arms and i figured something was wrong and so that was it
2181198 ive seen some terrible things there are people who take good care of their horses but i would say for most people its just a commodity its a money maker
2181199 its really a sad exploitation and i went into this business for the love of the horse
2181200 i was holding my breath as soon as i got on it was fun like riding a bike

2181205 our rabbis believe that removing a persons vital organs before pulmonary failure even after brain death is tantamount to manslaughter
2181206 there was no possible excuse or justification for this act this was arrogant group behaviour
2181207 the result was the total unnecessary loss of life without any regard for the standards and rules we live by and without any regard for the victim his family and friends
2181208 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2181209 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2181210 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
2181211 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
2181212 until a few years ago there was no privacy law in this country and each case tried to stretch it a bit further
2181213 the mosley case was the one that stretched it that bit further still with the judge quite clear in his reasoning its forced editors to be more careful certainly in a case of this nature where its a very high profile royal

2181216 it may have drawn a line under the big credit losses the capital raising is done and there are synergies to come through from abn but the underlying business is reflecting a tough market particularly in the united states
2181217 were in the middle of a financial markets crisis the industry is in a tight place and as a major participant in the industry we are in a tight place we are not alone in having taken writedowns

2181255 we expect to reach the larger population in the western portion of the state with our new presence in wilkins
2181256 we made adequate yearly progress this year and 91 percent of our families graded us with an a or a b in school quality and customer satisfaction so we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow and work with families throughout the western portions of pennsylvania
2181257 there are many reasons families choose cyber schools over the traditional bricks and mortar schools
2181258 we offer a more flexible course of studies we offer flexibility in the time students are able to attend school for example if students prefer to do assignments in the evening they may attend our school at their convenience
2181259 we offer a violence and drug free environment and we offer opportunities for families to structure their childs educational program around the needs of the family in short we offer a choice which is our strongest asset
2181260 we constantly hear districts say kids are being pulled from them
2181261 the charter school movement is about choice ive never gone to a student and said you have to come here they come by choice
2181262 parents will always retain the right to choose how and where they wish their children to become educated
2181263 no matter what educational facility is welcomed into our community the gateway school district will continue to provide its students with the best possible education so that they can thrive in our ever changing diverse world
2181264 he was just a kid who wanted to put on a show
2181265 its written in the vein of the late comedies of neil simon and noel coward
2181266 so many comic writers work for television or film rather than the stage
2181267 its more lucrative so we need good comedies like this one
2181268 its coming to me late in life and after all this time from pennsylvania where i grew up
2181269 e government is one of those catchy trendy buzzwords in the internet industry and people like myself are trying to make inroads in that area
2181270 statistics show people are coming back in october when we launched the site we got 250 300 visits a day in may we had over 1 800 visits
2181271 some long standing issues of resources are about to be resolved
2181272 i am for the first time in a long time optimistic that this project is going to be completed
2181273 a development like this is in line with a new form of urban revitalization for more mature urban communities like castle shannon
2181274 but i cant think of another group that deserves this more
2181275 i think its something were going to need to build on
2181276 its a shame when you lose a company like that because they really are the hub of the entire community
2181277 thats a legitimate concern you have people who are members in name only
2181278 but i think thats a problem the chiefs can sort out if you have someone who isnt pulling their weight the chief can say they dont qualify for the tax credit
2181279 thats very helpful in this current climate to have people agree on both sides
2181280 we all see the benefit these companies provide the story sells itself
2181281 everybody in the state is losing volunteers its across the board
2181282 if we dont do something to bolster those ranks its going to come out of everyones pocket because municipalities are going to have to look at hiring
2181283 it is an election year and congress probably isnt going to be doing a whole lot
2181284 but theres no reason why it couldnt pass in the near future
2181285 the lamp is woven into the fabric of the norwin community
2181286 every time workers appear and doors are open folks and kids walking by stop to watch theyre hoping the theater finally will reopen
2181287 actually kcs donated the lamp theater to the trust for 1 because it is vital to the revitalization project
2181288 its easier for the trust to secure community development grants than a private business
2181289 most people including potential investors who promised to help with funding have disappeared commercial money is tight these days all we can do is hope things will work out
2181290 considering the countrys fiscal crisis nobody can realistically set a timetable for the lamp to reopen but if we can get the right funding to finish most of the restoration im optimistic the lamp could reopen by late fall
2181291 s amp t bank intends to honor irwin banks commitments to the irwin project and community development in the norwin area
2181292 s amp t bank will continue to be sensitive to efforts encouraging economic development in the norwin community and surrounding areas
2181293 the lamp theater is essential to the revitalization of downtown irwin especially the business district
2181294 the read write heads are detaching from the arm and plowing deep gouges into the magnetic platter
2181295 the damage is mostly on the inner tracks but some scratches are on the outer track track 0 and once that happens the drive is normally beyond repair
2181296 if it is firmware version 7 01 then you have to panic
2181297 apple is being utterly irresponsible and should launch a product recall
2181298 the district has grown and the administration has outgrown the current facility administrators are crammed into small office space we have to store boxes of supplies in hallways
2181299 our main conference room where the board meets holds only 47 people if a big issue pops up and draws a large crowd we must move the meeting to the high school auditorium also the board does not have a room to conduct executive sessions in private
2181300 the estimated price tag was too high it cost 1 9 million to build the maintenance facility here were talking expansion
2181301 i sensed there would be a backlash from taxpayers if we didnt consider other and hopefully cheaper options
2181302 we received several phone calls from the public expressing concern about a 2 million price tag for an expansion
2181303 board and administration will review the proposals and consider the scope of the expansion required we could have a decision by the aug 18 voting meeting
2181304 weve had a lack of supervision we had to make a change
2181305 the rest of the stores are very solid right now
2181306 we thought we would get the volume there because of all the rooftops and the need for home improvement
2181307 preserving and improving the quality of life in the 14th ward made up of squirrel hill and parts of point breeze regent square and swisshelm park
2181308 people arent going to have to ask what the coalition does anymore

2181310 normally we have a pretty good relationship with the allegheny county housing authority police
2181311 we have any problems we notify them and they take care of it its just one happened to sneak by them
2181312 running 5 000 some units for people 18 years and older who has the manpower and resources to run people over and over again
2181313 and when do you stop do you run them once a month once a year
2181314 in a utopian situation it seems like the right thing to do but the more i see how broken things are i hesitate to advocate for any funding for this program
2181315 for all the cons there are a lot of pros for having section 8 because we police it
2181316 the private sector isnt bound by provisions like the department of housing and urban development is
2181317 it came to me who better to write it than the person who lived it mr eiben said

2181352 im an exchange student here in monterrey mexico im originally from france and two months ago i left my family and my loved one there what i like about google talk is the mp3 message you get in your gmail address when someone leaves you a voicemail you see my girlfriend works during the day and with the time difference its sometimes hard to stay the phone for a long time so when shes sleeping and i on the other end of the planet am not i leave her google talk messages and she listens to them at work during the day while i am asleep also she can transfer the mp3 messages on her usb device at work and take them home to listen to me if she misses me or she can just connect back to her email address and im there in a way google talk helps us keep up our relationship and reduces a bit of the awful distance that separates us
2181353 i am hard of hearing and in my daily work activities and i conduct or
2181354 i talk to my 1 year old niece on google talk she lives in north dakota and i am in michigan
2181355 we want to be a tree city usa and we want beautiful trees but we dont have enough in our budget to take care of them
2181356 we were backpedaling trying to get away we probably had about four seconds and the tree kind of shifted hitting other trees in the canopy
2181357 we were hurt but not seriously the tree left scratches we could immediately see what looked like brush burns and scratches on our necks on my hands
2181358 my 8 year old took the worst of it and she cant remember much she must have thrown her arms up she had bruises on the insides of them
2181359 ive been told that the nature conservancy wants nature to be nature so if a tree is damaged or dead it should fall on its own
2181360 i for one have spent a lot of time in the woods in my life and i had always assumed there had to be a catastrophe like a lightning strike or high wind to topple a tree
2181361 regarding the situation in bird park in particular i have talked with lori
2181362 if someone calls up and says there is a hazard a limb has fallen well get out there we will interrupt our regular work schedule
2181363 but if its just a standard tree trim thats something that is scheduled
2181364 a lot of people use those parks and we hear from them believe me from regular people who find things they consider dangerous
2181365 there is a sleep over in bird park my son always goes to they have it through the mt lebanon recreation department

2181372 it also makes them feel like people care and it introduces them to the world outside of the shelter
2181373 it gives them a chance to be able to laugh again and to feel childlike again and to be free of stress for a while
2181374 a lot of them just loved being able to be on a stage and perform
2181375 and for some of them who had never been on a stage before an audience they were inspired that they had done something more than they had ever done in the past
2181376 it sounds like that definition would include snakes and people do have snakes as pets
2181377 but if we pass this with this language in there well have every snake owner in the township down here complaining
2181378 i think we ought to get it right before we approve it so we dont end up going back and amending it later

2181578 the ddc attempts to organize all knowledge into ten main classes the ten main classes are then further subdivided each main class has ten divisions and each division has ten sections hence the system can be summarized in 10 main classes 100 divisions and 1000 sections ddcs advantage in choosing decimals for its categories allows it to be both purely numerical and infinitely hierarchical it also uses some aspects of a faceted classification scheme combining elements from different parts of the structure to construct a number representing the subject content often combining two subject elements with linking numbers and geographical and temporal elements and form of an item rather than drawing upon a list containing each class and its meaning besides its frequent revision ddcs main advantage over its chief rival the library of congress classification system developed shortly afterward is its simplicity thanks to the use of pure notation a mnemonics system and a hierarchical decimal place system it is generally easier to use for most users ddc and udc are also more flexible than library of congress classification because of greater use of facets via auxiliary tables while library of congress classification is almost totally enumerative on the flip side ddcs decimal system means that it is less hospitable to the addition of new subjects as opposed to library of congress classification which has 21 classes at the top level another side effect of this is that ddc notations can be very much longer compared to the equivalent class in other classification systems another disadvantage of ddc is that it was developed in the 19th century by essentially one man and was built on a top down approach to classify all human knowledge which made it difficult to adapt to changing fields of knowledge in contrast the library of congress classification system was developed based mainly on the idea of literary warrant classes were added by individual experts in each area only when needed for works owned by the library of congress as a result while the library of congress classification system was able to incorporate changes and additions of new branches of knowledge particularly in the fields of engineering and computer science the greater hospitability of the library of congress classification was also a factor ddc has been criticized for being inadequate for covering those areas as a result most major academic libraries in the us do not use the ddc because the classification of works in those areas is not specific enough the library of congress classification system is not without problems because each area is developed by an expert according to demands of cataloging there is little consistency it is also highly us centric more so than ddc because of the nature of the system and compared to ddc it has been translated into far fewer languages the library of congress classification system is also more complicated to use and unlike ddc cannot be customized for the needs of a smaller library collection

2181615 we discussed with him very clearly that at north hills if one of our staff members were to partake in any of the offerings at canyon it would not be recognized at north hills
2181616 we dont see the affiliation being necessarily relevant here at north hills
2181617 maybe there was some misinformation brought to us by them
2181618 if someone is taking course work to get a degree they need to do their homework to ensure it is an accredited legitimate degree granting institution otherwise they may end up spending money and doing work for what ultimately could be a meaningless degree
2181619 i dont know anything about canyon college and quite honestly i dont really care what im looking for is somebody who can shoot the lights out for the north hills school district
2181620 we hired a guy to do a job as an administrator based on the feedback that weve received from the people who know him best in his previous district weve received rave reviews

2181623 we just were trying to do something that was good for the district
2181624 i had all the right intentions in mind and that is to help educators become better educators
2181625 theres no legal basis for the claim this is a legitimate degree
2181626 the entity itself has no legal authority to issue degrees it would be like saying i did a bunch of course work for wal mart and they gave me a degree

2181650 a view from the outside why good economics works for everyone
2181651 the only country india can compare with is china everyday i compare our country with china and ask why we cant overtake it when can we overtake china only when we have the resources and the courage to stage the olympics
2181652 we have great potential and great talent all we need is to get our act together the problem is not politics but governance if india could not do it olympics in 2008 we should set a date for ourselves if i were you i will ask political parties to say india must be able to pitch for hosting the 2020 olympics

2181680 i kind of see what were doing as a grass roots movement to leverage the school board to try to get a fair curriculum
2181681 you just want to promote what you believe in and are passionate about

2181683 kids are not learning how to think outside the box and thats what art does if you have a good arts program in school it helps develop kids creative thinking process
2181684 we must have had something in common because we became best buddies
2181685 it was a 4 4 1 2 hour drive home and for the first time dad was willing to open up and talk about the experience
2181686 maybe it was as if he thought until now if he didnt talk about hurtful things it wouldnt hurt
2181687 there i was in a nursing home when i got the call
2181688 people were stopping to ask about it at the airport
2181689 the losses were about equal the people we lost to weather and the people we lost to combat
2181690 the first thing i asked the guy was are my legs still there
2181691 people were coming up to my dad spontaneously asked to shake his hand and to thank him

2181702 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2181703 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
2181704 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armoured vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2181705 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia

2181707 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2181708 all sides should bring an immediate end to the violence and engage in direct talks to resolve this matter peacefully
2181709 the georgian leadership has resorted to very aggressive actions in south ossetia in fact it started warfare using heavy armour and artillery
2181710 this is very sad and this will incur a response
2181711 restoring peace in south ossetia and defending the local civilian population within the peacekeeping mandate we have
2181712 we are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region

2181725 we heard about the problem of food banks around the country increasingly drying up
2181726 we never imagined the amount of people they regularly served here in the north bay
2181727 often the very best business strategy is simply doing what is right for the community
2181728 and giving something back rather than looking to take has its own rewards in the long run
2181729 we know our gift of canned tuna will not go far enough but if more people take the time to think and find it in themselves to give a little whenever possible perhaps just perhaps someday we wont need food banks at all

2181740 there is a public interest that justifies overriding the private rights of authors in their works in particular circumstances
2181741 a balanced interpretation of the three step test in copyright law
2181742 copyright law aims to benefit the public interest it produces important incentives for the creation and dissemination of new works of authorship to the general public these works serve to satisfy common needs either in their own right or as a basis for the creation of further works
2181743 the three step test has already established an effective means of preventing the excessive application of limitations and exceptions
2181744 the public interest is not well served if copyright law neglects the more general interests of individuals and groups in society when establishing incentives for rightholders
2181745 in applying the three step test national courts and legislatures have been wrongly influenced by restrictive interpretations of that test

2182007 the church as a divine oracle is commissioned to bear authoritative witness to gods revelation in christ
2182008 in establishing the magisterium christ responded to a real human need people cannot discover the contents of revelation by their unaided powers of reason and observation they have to be told by people who have received in from on high even the most qualified scholars who have access to the bible and the ancient historical sources fall into serious disagreements about matters of belief
2182009 it is logical to suppose that if god deems it important to give a revelation he will make provision to assure its conservation
2182010 if he did not set up reliable organs of transmission the revelation would in a few generations be partly forgotten and inextricably commingled with human speculations as happened for instance in gnosticism
2182011 would in a few generations be partly forgotten and inextricably commingled with human speculations
2182012 just as the christians of the first generation had to rely on the word of the apostles and their follow workers so the christians of later generations must continue to rely on the living authority of those who succeed to the place of the apostles
2182013 the bible understood in its totality is a final authority in the sense that it may not be contradicted
2182014 but tradition and the magisterium are necessary to ensure the correct use and interpretation of scripture
2182015 on the basis of tradition the magisterium drew up the canon of scripture and assumed responsibility for safeguarding the sacred books as an authoritative record of revelation in its constitutive period
2182016 by its unceasing vigilance the magisterium preserves the scriptures as a sacred deposit and supervises editions translations and commentaries
2182017 the council of trent in 1546 published a list of canonical books
2182018 the magisterium drew up the canon of scripture in its constitutive period
2182019 in the earl christian centuries each local church was headed by a bishop who was not only the leader but above all the teacher of the community
2182020 the true doctrine of the apostles he irenaeus asserts comes down through the succession of bishops in a phrase not easy to interpret irenaeus affirms that bishops of the apostolic churches upon their accession to the episcopate have received the sure gift of truth he seems to mean that the bishops are reliable teachers not only because they have received the sacred deposit of faith but especially because the holy spirit through a sacramentally conferred charism assists them to discern the truth of revelation
2182021 since the ecumenical councils of the patristic era were all held in the east very few latin bishops actually took part the pope was not personally present but usually sent delegates who were treated with great deference it eventually became a rule that the decisions of the council could not be valid without roman approval
2182022 the adherence of the five great patriarchates rome alexandria antioch constantinople and jerusalem was considered important but in the event of disputes among the other patriarchates the judgment of rome prevailed
2182023 papal censures often did no more than ratify lists of condemned propositions prepared by theologians the university of paris was considered especially authoritative in its doctrinal determinations the doctrinal decrees of several general councils lyons i 1245 lyons ii 1274 and vienne 1312 were submitted to university faculties fore approval before being published
2182024 at the council of constance 1415 18 pierre dailly former chancellor of the university of paris successfully contended that the doctors of sacred theology should have a deliberative vote since they had received the authority to preach and teach everywhere an authority that greatly exceeds that of an individual bishop or an ignorant abbot or titular
2182025 in the first millennium the great teachers of sacred doctrine were for the most part bishops though there were notable exceptions such as tertullian clement of alexandria origen ephrem and jerome these non bishops engaged not only in theological speculation but also in the proclamation and defense of the faith and sometimes played a prominent role in the formulation of official doctrine for example athanasius while still a deacon participated actively in the debates at the council of nicaea
2182026 with the rise of the universities in the high middle ages a clearer division of labor emerged the studium academy having its center in paris came to be recognized as a third locus of authority alongside the sacerdotium priesthood in the sense of spiritual authority centered in rome and the imperium secular rule situated at the capital of the empire
2182027 thomas aquinas for example called magisterium cathedrae magistralis a magisterium of the professorial chair the bishops by contrast had a magisterium cathedrae pastoralis a magisterium of the pastoral chair ioachim salaverri recognizes both a magisterium docens which uses human argumentation and a magisterium attestans which bears authoritative witness to the deposit of faith
2182028 frances sullivan distinguishes between magisterium mere docens sue scientificum and magisterium attestans
2182029 in the centuries after his aquinas death the university faculties exerted considerable power over the hierarchy itself prevailing on bishops to condemn propositions disapproved by the professors
2182030 non bishops have at times exercised a variety of magisterial functions in the first few centuries christian emperors were considered competent to convoke councils preside over them though without a vote and promulgate their decrees the church of that time does not seem to have objected in the middle ages secular princes religious superiors and theologians frequently took part in ecclesiastical councils conciliar documents and encyclicals are not uncommonly drafted by theologians under the direction of hierarchical teachers
2182031 as indicated by the preceding citation from melchior cano the fathers of the church hold a preeminent place among theological authorities already in the sixth century the gelasian decree on books to be received and not received
2182032 the official title doctor of the church has been bestowed on certain canonized saints who have been singled out by popes or councils for their eminence in learning and soundness of doctrine doctors in this sense do not have to be members of the magisterium nearly half of the thirty three were not bishops a few such as st ephrem were never ordained to the priesthood under paul vi and john paul ii three women were added to the catalogue of doctors catherine of siena teresa of avila and therese of lisieux
2182033 the hierarchy as cardinal newman pointed out frequently consults the laity before defining doctrines after a doc trine is proclaimed the laity are obliged to accept it loyally deferring to the magisterium
2182034 ecumenical councils are gatherings of bishops from the whole world the pope and he alone has the prerogative of convoking and presiding over such councils their decrees to be valid but be confirmed or at least approved by him lg 22 this view of councils is a development beyond the ancient view in which the emperor normally convoked councils and gave juridical force to their decrees it differs also from the medieval conciliarist theory in which the bishops could decide independently of the pope when and how often they would meet in council the teaching of vatican ii on ecumenical councils unlike the imperialist and conciliarist models reflects a correct theology of primacy and episcopacy
2182035 all agree that the pope as head is able to perform certain acts that other members of the college cannot perform one school of theologians who sometimes point to mt 16 19 and 18 18 contend that the lord made peter his vicar and head of the church before he formed the apostolic college and endowed it with similar powers hence it follows tha the popes powers are independent of those belonging to the college of cardinals theologians of another school contend that the pope is head of the church and vicar of christ only because and insofar as he is head of the college of bishops
2182036 the exact ecclesial status of the synod of bishops is still in flux and his debated among experts
2182037 the theological status and teaching authority of episcopal conferences were clarified by pope john paul ii in his motu proprio apostolos suos in may 21 1998
2182038 this was followed in 2004 by the directory of the pastoral ministry of bishops apostolorum successors
2182039 there is no need to deny that the magisterium sometimes uses mutable human concepts to convey transcendent truth
2182040 the universal magisterium of the bishops can be exercised in either of two forms called ordinary and extraordinary
2182041 there is however no canonical list of all the ecumenical councils
2182042 councils such as trend and vatican i often divided their decrees into chapters and canons in such as way that the chapters stated positively the contradictory of what the anathema denied the teaching of the chapter is definitive at least to the extent that it contradicts the anathema in the canon but besides containing defined doctrine the chapters often contain additional explanatory matter that is not infallibly taught
2182043 the sacramentality of episcopal ordination is moreover stated with great emphasis commentators generally agree that while this is not a dogmatic definition in the strict sense it ranks as a definitive judgment and calls for obligatory adherence
2182044 in explaining the infallibility of such definitions vatican i laid down several conditions or limitations the popes teaching is infallible only when he speaks a in the chair of peter using his full apostolic authority b concerning a doctrine of faith or morals doctrina de fide vel moribus and c defining what must be held as a matter of faith by all members of the church
2182045 except for the definition of the immaculate conception there is little clarity about which papal statements prior to vatican i are irreformable most authors would agree on about half a dozen statements
2182046 although the response of the cdf is not itself protected by the charism of infallibility it embodies the considered judgment of the highest doctrinal organ of the church confirmed by the pope
2182047 there has been much discussion regarding the object of the infallible magisterium
2182048 theologians accordingly distinguish between the primary object of infallibility the deposit of revelation itself and the secondary object whatever is required to defend and expound the deposit the line of demarcation between the primary and secondary objects is not always easy to draw because the primary object has a capacity for expansion as new implications come to be recognized in the original deposit
2182049 in the early twentieth century there was an inconclusive debate about whether the church can dogmatically define what is only virtually rather than formally revealed
2182050 unless the church could identify her popes and ecumenical councils with full authority her dogmatic teaching would be clouded by doubt
2182051 at a conference with cardinal ratzinger and other representatives of the cdf and several committees on doctrine archbishop daniel pilarczyk as chairman of the committee on doctrine of the united states conference of catholic bishops remarked further clarification about the churchs ability to teach matters of natural law infallibly would be desirable
2182052 who am i please someone tell me who i am
2182053 in the manuals published before and during vatican ii it was customary to attach theological notes or qualifications to every proposition being taught was it a matter of faith to be believed by all under pain of heresy or did it have some lesser degree of obligatory force these theological notes depended primarily on the degree to which the magisterium had engaged its authority a very simplified list would include the following 1 doctrine of faith a defined by pope or council b taught by the ordinary and universal magisterium 2 doctrine infallibly taught as inseparably connected with revelation 3 doctrine authoritatively but non infallibly taught by magisterium 4 theological conclusion logically deduced from a proposition of faith 5 probable opinion
2182054 ioachim salaverri in the treatise de ecclesia of the multivolume sacrae theologiae summa lists fourteen theological notes used in the series with the censures of errors opposed to each
2182055 in the decade following the council these theological notes disappeared from textbooks there was a period of confusion as to what doctrines were binding on what grounds and it what measure
2182056 to remedy the growing confusion the holy see took a series of steps several of which may be mentioned here
2182057 in 1968 pope paul promulgated a profession of faith popularly known as the credo of the people of god in 1973 the congregation for the doctrine of the faith published the declaration mysterium ecclesiae in 1983 the pope promulgated the revised code of canon law the extraordinary assembly of the synod of bishops in 1985 asked pope john paul to draw up a universal catechism in 1989 the congregation for the doctrine of the faith published a new profession of faith it replaced the much briefer profession of faith of 1967 which had itself replaced the tridentine profession of faith in may 1998 pope john paul ii in the motu propiro ad tuendam fidem amended the code of canon law using the publication of ad tuendam as the occasion cardinal joseph ratzinger as prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith together with archbishop tarcisio bertone secretary of the congregation used a joint commentary on the three concluding paragraphs of the profession of faith
2182058 the second added paragraph deals with other doctrines pertaining to faith and morals that are proposed by the church definitively definitive
2182059 the majority of pre vatican ii theological manuals admitted the concept of ecclesiastical faith but some very distinguished authors including francisco marin sola ambroise gardeil and charles journet opposed it
2182060 this does not foreclose the possibility that in the future the church might progress to the point where this teaching the reservation of priestly orders to men could be defined as a doctrine to be believe as divinely revealed
2182061 such a reclassification according to the commentary would not be unprecedented as examples of truths connected with the deposit of faith by historical necessity the ratzinger bertone commentary suggests the invalidity of anglican orders as declared by pope leo xiii since vatican ii moreover there have been new debates about the possibility of recognizing anglican orders
2182062 following the language of vatican ii the profession of faith states that the catholic must adhere to authentic but non definitive teaching with religious submission will and intellect the term obsequium religiosum introduced at this point is notoriously difficult to translate into english but if falls short of the absolute and irrevocable assent required in the first two categories because in this case the infallibility of the church is not engaged
2182063 even in the case of definitive teaching development occurs through a kind of dialectic of proclamation and response
2182064 vatican ii in fact overcame many imbalances that had affected catholic official teaching during the years since trent
2182065 some scholars believe that it not only filled in deficiencies but in some respects corrected previous non infallible teaching on subjects such as membership in the church church and state religious freedom ecumenism and non christian religions
2182066 for discussion of these possible reversals see dionne the papacy and the church
2182067 other scholars content that in these areas the previous teaching was not wrong but was in need of being adapted to a changed social and religious situation the council they maintain simply made a new application of principles that had long been part of the tradition each of these cases is complicated and must be carefully examined for its own sake
2182068 it often takes several generates before a consensus is reached or before the magisterium itself issues an authentic interpretation in 1985 on the twentieth anniversary of the conclusion of the council pope john paul ii summoned an extraordinary assembly of the synod of bishops to lay down guidelines for its correct interpretation

2182092 but from this there issues immediately another thought quite inseparable from it viz

2182094 but the other element that of faithfulness is equally much emphasized from the beginning jehovah the god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations ex

2182147 no our troops in harms way must have their homes taken away because of debt they do need more to worry about
2182148 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
2182149 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
2182150 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
2182151 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
2182152 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
2182153 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
2182154 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
2182155 i think my wife is having an affair with the electrician the other day i came home and found wire cutters under our bed and they werent mine

2182162 we had a really special thing both of us felt safe for the first time ever and you start to open up with someone when you feel safe thats where we were at when it happened
2182163 but thats the way things happened id never experienced a death close to me before a part of me definitely died with him but another part was opened up
2182164 it took a long time and there was so much chaos after he died for me but hopefully you learn you learn
2182165 at that stage antony was really obsessed with playing soft i learnt a lot from that antony is so supportive a lot can happen through his guidance hes always holding you even if hes not near you

2182167 we all knew she her mother was going to go
2182168 it was just a matter of when i mean were all gonna go but when you know there is a lot less time it makes you appreciate the time you have left i tried to take advantage of talking to her a lot and sharing her memories to survive especially is written from her perspective
2182169 i think the older you get the more you find that people around you are dying
2182170 you can feel very depressed about that or you can really grasp it and be reminded that theres a time limit for you too because it does go fast incredibly fast unbelievably fast i really hope that feeling is on the new record
2182171 and the hopefulness that remains because you are lucky enough to be here
2182172 i mean mentally alive when you are on tour for so long you can start to feel like a ghost
2182173 i wrote that for us to sing because rufus and i were in similar positions in our lives
2182174 we feel the same way about our country and we were also dealing with similar personal situations with both our mums with cancer the bulk of that song the verses are about letting go and allowing what happens to happen even if its extremely painful
2182175 the song works pretty well on all those levels i think and rufus is a great singer he doesnt sound too shabby our rufus not too shabby at all
2182176 a lot of troubling things were going on and i did make it through yes there was a personal relationship that i am not dealing with any longer i am thankful to say
2182177 but you know music is a place where i can go to feel
2182178 ive got so much from music in my life and i feel responsible about giving back to it
2182179 im on a path of trying to be more honest and that includes being more vulnerable because i think that is the place of power its not like ive arrived or anything its an ongoing process but when you can say this is where my weakness lies its not your point of weakness any more its the way to personal freedom
2182180 there they go i must follow them for i am their leader

2182248 when we have good nose tackles were really really good
2182249 its like someone coming up and slapping you in the face
2182250 when guys were working out i had to sit back and watch
2182251 theyre looking at you like youre getting a break but youre not you want to be out there
2182252 their techniques the way they play the run and their pass rushes
2182253 im trying to steal whatever they have so i can play at their level
2182254 it could be just one thing how vicious they do the rip or how quick their first step was then ill come out the next day and say this is my first step day or my vicious rip day
2182255 he set the example of what a usc nose tackle was really supposed to be all about
2182256 say the center doesnt try to block me i have to get a hand on him to slow him up from getting to the linebacker
2182257 but i dont have to take that block for the next guy i just have to give them a chance to beat the center and i get freed up as well
2182258 i dont think were going to need to because i think averell spicer and christian tupou or one of those other guys are going to be just fine
2182259 ever since ive been here my philosophy is i cant let anybody younger beat me out
2182260 now im the oldest nose tackle so i plan not to let that happen
2182261 our system the way our defense plays it gives the nose tackle a lot of opportunities to make tackles

2182268 damnit the black wire is the hot one i said give me the ground yes gabriel the one with no freaking insulation on it
2182269 according to pmod at the world radiation center there has been no increase in solar irradiance since at least 1978 when satellite observations began this means that for the last thirty years while the temperature has been rising fastest the sun has not changed
2182270 the milankovitch theory 1 of climate change is not perfectly worked out in particular the largest observed response is at the 100 000 year timescale but the forcing is apparently small at this scale in regard to the ice ages various feedbacks from carbon dioxide or from ice sheet dynamics are invoked to explain this discrepancy
2182271 present conditions the amount of solar radiation insolation in the northern hemisphere at 65 n seems to be related to occurrence of an ice age astronomical calculations show that 65 n summer insolation should increase gradually over the next 25 000 years and that no declines in 65 n summer insolation sufficient to cause an ice age are expected in the next 50 000 to 100 000 years as mentioned above at present perihelion occurs during the southern hemispheres summer and aphelion during the southern winter thus the southern hemisphere seasons should tend to be somewhat more extreme than the northern hemisphere seasons the relatively low eccentricity of the present orbit results in a 6 8 difference in the amount of solar radiation during summer in the two hemispheres
2182272 observations show climate behaviour is much more intense than the calculated variations
2182273 it would be impossible for us to be seeing changes this rapid over the last 25 years even taking into consideration
2182274 observations show climate behaviour is much more intense than the calculated variations
2182275 its almost as if conservatives take pride in being ignorant

2182339 the energy department released data this week showing that u
2182340 what difference does more oil 10 years from now matter
2182341 makes more sense to spend that 10 years innovating our sustainable energy
2182342 assumptions about exploration development and production of economical fields drilling schedules costs platform selection reserves to production ratios etc in the ocs access case are based on data for fields in the western gulf of mexico that are of similar water depth and size exploration and development on the ocs in the pacific the atlantic and the eastern gulf are assumed to proceed at rates similar to those seen in the early development of the gulf region in addition it is assumed that local infrastructure issues and other potential non federal impediments will be resolved after federal access restrictions have been lifted with these assumptions technically recoverable undiscovered resources in the lower 48 ocs increase to 59 billion barrels of oil and 288 trillion cubic feet of natural gas as compared with the reference case levels of 41 billion barrels and 210 trillion cubic feet the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 in the ocs access case is projected to be 1 6 percent higher than in the reference case and 3 percent higher in 2030 alone at 5 6 million barrels per day for the lower 48 ocs annual crude oil production in 2030 is projected to be 7 percent higher 2 4 million barrels per day in the ocs access case compared with 2 2 million barrels per day in the reference case figure 20 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
2182343 drilling new oil wells takes a long time because the people who use the it will take too long excuse want it to take a long time
2182344 sorry to say this but the another energy crisis will re appear the next time that oil supplies are short in probably 10 years or less
2182345 if everyone predicts correctly and the price of oil falls that there will be no incentive to invest in alternative energys

2182379 the worst part was that i had no indication of any trouble and wasnt prepared
2182380 i immediately called all of my friends and family members to let them know that i had lost my job and needed their help to find contacts in my field i stopped by the library and pulled copies of local newspapers from the last few weeks and wrote down the names of potential employers i also logged onto several job sites on the internet it was amazing how many companies were looking for drivers
2182381 you couldnt pay me enough to go back to my old lifestyle sure i had nice clothes and more money to spend but what i have now money cant buy im home nearly every night for dinner and im available to volunteer at my daughters school occasionally i love working with the elderly and enabling them to continue living independently the pace of my life is different and i couldnt be happier
2182382 after 15 years with this company i felt completely unprepared to begin a search for a new job i took it slow i spent about 3 weeks building my r sum and then had everyone i knew critique it i drafted the body of several cover letters so that when an opportunity arose i didnt have to start from scratch i began logging on to online job search sites and learned how to apply for jobs online i started talking to people i encountered everywhere about their jobs and any possible openings in my field on a daily basis i had to remind myself that i wasnt stalking people i was simply talking to them about their jobs i bought a great interview outfit so that i was prepared once invitations to interview started coming in and i prepared answers to the most commonly asked interview questions i also took some time each day to do something i enjoyed i took walks with friends and never missed a day going to the bus stop with my son all of these are luxuries i didnt have when i was employed full time perhaps the most important thing i did when i lost my job was to stay fresh in my field by taking on some contract work although i havent landed a job yet i am hopeful that my efforts will soon pay off
2182383 when was the last time you heard one of your former colleagues say that their new job was a complete disaster the truth is it usually doesnt happen with every new job you land you become a little more educated about the process after a few serious interviews youve learned how to research companies to find out how theyve been performing and their financial outlook most importantly youve learned to ask the right questions during an interview to ensure a good fit
2182384 als er een paradijs verloren is gegaan moet het daarvoor zijn geweest maar ik kan niet eens beginnen als er een paradijs verloren is gegaan hebben we het al terug voor ik begonnen ben gooi dat scenario ook maar weer in de prullemand zet de fik maar in die hoop nutteloze papieren want in de prullemand is niet weg genoeg we leven maar n keer we moeten het zien gebeuren ik heb een koning nodig een centraal gezag dat mij zegt begin nu maar je bent een brave jongen maar nu nu moet je toch wat het is tijd ik heb er n maar die zit midden in de nacht als ik al begonnen ben en niet kan slapen dan zie ik hem en dan kan ik hem horen zijn koninklijke bevelen verspreiden mij de levieten lezen maar dat beginnen daar komt geen einde aan kijk daar loopt ze ze heeft een kartonnen kaartje vast met daarop mijn naam heel haar gezicht is naar mij vertekend zij weet het ik zie het en iedereen weet het maar we kunnen maar niet beginnen de tijd loopt ons in dikke vlokken uit de handen de verloren toekomst gutst uit de vingers waarvan de nagels in onze rottende lijven zijn blijven steken we verwaaien het regent alle letters van de goddelijke lust maar de druppels vallen door ons ze plakken onze inzakkende asse pardoes op de grond we resten als zwarte vlekken in het zwart van de zwarte nacht ik had de koning nodig die ik vast ging maken maar het beginsel van de koning was al afgestorven vooraleer ik kon beginnen laat staan dat ik hem in de eindeloze nacht kon kronen ach koning dit begin duurt amp duurt het is onbegonnen werk kom draai je om ik zal je troosten met de helende kennis der falende goden de zalvende woorden die de oude scriptoreptielen angstvallig noteerden in de annalen van nobolvlada de verdoemde stad van de hitsige letterbezweerders als zij ergens een ogenblik verpozing vonden van de meedogenloze jacht der nobolvladaanse machthebbers op hun magere maar fijnzinnig krokante lijfjes

2182392 punishing states by taking away votes because of past voting fraud
2182393 and most of you people are the same people who claim bush is trampling the constitution
2182394 the electoral college would be fine if any all and every party had the same opportunities as the two established parties have if the media wouldnt marginalize or even completely ignore any but the two establishment parties if there were not so many barriers to getting on the ballot in all 50 states why do we have a system of government controlled by only two powerful parties arent they more susceptible to being controlled by those with enough money and ownership of enough of the media wouldnt it serve the people if they were not just given two choices both of which will still benefit those people with money no matter which of the two parties prevails
2182395 the people actually chose these two unqualified men to run for president

2182406 just out of curiosity how did you arrive at the fallacy that mccain is
2182407 despite what appears to be a middle class lifestyle the couple has written 61 600 in checks to john mccains presidential campaign and the republican national committee most of it within days of mccains decision to endorse offshore oil drilling

2182416 the correction doesnt fundamentally change the content of the article the correction on those two donations doesnt answer questions about all of the other donations mccain raised from a bundler with questionable associations and questionable tactics it also doesnt provide any answer about the ny couple that donated 61 600 to mccains campaign simply because the harry sargeant may have raised money for other candidates unethically does not make it any more acceptable if done for mccain
2182417 palestinian brothers inside the hamas controlled gaza strip are listed in government election filings as having donated 29 521 54 to sen barack obamas campaign
2182418 the law forbids high level supporters from writing huge checks but with help from friends in the middle east and the former chief of the cias bin laden unit who now serves as a consultant to his company sargeant has raised more than 100 000 for three presidential candidates from a collection of ordinary people several of whom professed little interest in the outcome of the election

2182467 we have the most vulnerable and desperate population in los angeles down here and the abuse and violence they regularly witness is an injustice but to add to that this financial abuse its intolerable

2182473 freeport was on the list of five locations that i considered we needed to move to to stay competitive and maintain a quick delivery system
2182474 when i first got off the plane in freeport from fort lauderdale i liked it immediately
2182475 when i met the executives at the port authority i was so impressed with their open ness to accept a foreigner and a new project
2182476 after driving down the queens highway and seeing all the land and buildings available for the factory it was like a dream come true so many opportunities so much time that could be saved
2182477 very few places i have been to can come close to what freeport offers and i have lived worked and visited 50 countries
2182478 freeport also has port connection services to all of the eastern seaboard the gulf ports and even europe conveniently available the lower cost of logistics just favours freeport over any other city we might have considered
2182479 its been fascinating to work with them its a great company a company whose business model is well served by what freeport has to offer

2182482 the good thing is it can turn very fast people think that steel framing is a low end type of construction material but when you wrap it up with good finishing good marble work and good detail work and good furniture in a good design and a good location it could be a 3 million building once you enclose the walls with gyprock and other finishing it just looks like any other house
2182483 we want to start it here with something of quality that people will look at and say that this system is not only for fast turns and affordable housing

2182538 basic fact of biblical religion that god pardons and accepts believing sinners
2182539 determines the whole character of christianity as a religion of grace and faith
2182540 it defines the saving significance of christs life and death by relating both to gods law
2182541 it displays gods justice in condemning and punishing sin his mercy in pardoning and accepting sinners and his wisdom in exercising both attributes harmoniously together through christ
2182542 it make clear what faith is belief in christs atoning death and justifying resurrection and trust in him alone for rigteousness
2182543 it makes clear what christian morality is law keeping out of gratitude to the savior whose gift of righteousness made law keeping needless for acceptance
2182544 it explains all hints prophecies and instances of salvation in the o ld t estament

2182701 with so many of the records that i work on now i go from start to finish without leaving pro tools
2182702 we still have the mpc in the studio but we dont use it much anymore

2182730 nobody will say they are small fry and in each of those cases the government will be seeking the death penalty
2182731 this was a case of a fair minded panel of military officers operating in a fundamentally unfair system
2182732 the fact that the military officers performed their duties conscientiously does not make fair a system which allows the use of coerced evidence is designed to cover up abuse and disregards basic due process protections
2182733 if this isnt enough to validate the commissions against the strident and unfair criticism i dont what would be
2182734 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial

2182762 consolidar la paz en la regi n equivale a lograr que germine una preciada semilla de convivencia y desarrollo

2182771 yakaboski is having a great camp and willie griffin is going everything we expected of him
2182772 we all know he has great speed and quickness and burst and the ability to make plays we want to get a good look at him in the backfield and see what we really think its still early as far as the evaluation of chris

2182776 they bought us kentucky fried chicken and filmed us eating it
2182777 we didnt do anything wrong we were speaking up for the chinese people we refused to pay
2182778 lets face it china doesnt have a very good record on human rights its very troubling when you dont hear from someone in 24 hours
2182779 we call on china to use the opportunity of the olympics to demonstrate greater openness and tolerance and to respect the fundamental and universally recognized right of all people to peacefully express their views
2182780 well be monitoring it as we go through the process well be very cautions and move forward day to day

2182785 we just thought of the great idea to sign for this grant for after school matters
2182786 we thought of the idea to teach kids in the community about technology in digital photography
2182787 we taught them photography how to properly compose a picture gave them different assignments and showed them how to create handmade books
2182788 they did a self portrait they are also doing different fliers and are going to distribute it to the community
2182789 we want to show their accomplishment by showing the kids art books and their pictures
2182790 their level of creativity in the pictures can be seen from the pictures they started with to what they ended up now
2182791 this book is for those who are confused by all the stuff you have to know just to take pictures with a digital camera today
2182792 it is your opportunity to finally learn and remember all you need to know about digital photography

2182796 he wants us to walk in this after all the things weve been through that have led us to be totally despairing he wants us to get our endorphins up by walking in a torrential downpour and dodging the wayward paths of irritated motorists this passes for a friendly suggestion somehow explain this to me
2182797 things probably look different where he is hes right by the ocean not off the highway in the mountains like we are not that a different perspective invalidates the suggestion it might be the best thing
2182798 so do you youre just more grudging about it i take the suggestion in 2 seconds where you take 2 days if youre allowed to
2182799 true enough but i am not walking in that there is no way
2182800 well he wasnt dead set on us walking around out there he just said really to go outside move get some endorphins going and get out of the rut

2182856 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
2182857 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
2182858 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
2182859 the difference that i see in felix now is tonight he clearly didnt have his best stuff and hes still into the eighth inning
2182860 he didnt try to strike everybody out he was pitching to contact for sure
2182861 i think the key there was the first three innings
2182862 a guy that your team and the other team knows that they really have their work cut out for them that day
2182863 and as an opposing club you come in and know you may have to alter your game plan in a big way
2182864 to be able to go out there without having his best stuff and dominate for eight innings i think it shows you his maturity that hes growing as a pitcher
2182865 hes very much upbeat hes feeling like the organization has got to find out about some other people
2182866 its a great thing for our city district 1 and the state of washington
2182867 were getting great support down here people are listening online texting us e mailing its been wonderful
2182868 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2182869 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2182870 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2182871 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2182872 im here to represent my country to the fullest and im here to be an ambassador for my country
2182873 i need to send the message as an athlete from sudan im worried about the kids who are dying in darfur
2182874 im here to inspire other kids who are out there watching these olympics as i was watching the sydney olympics
2182875 me coming here im here to compete for my country the olympics are supposed to bring people together to peacefully blend and im looking forward to that and stepping on the track and wearing my colors and representing my country
2182876 hes supposed to be here hes an olympian its supposed to tell people about the situation that happened
2182877 chinese people have been great putting all these things together its great being here
2182878 we hope that these beijing olympic games can enhance friendship between different countries and regions and enhance friendship between athletes
2182879 im very honored to be here and im very honored to lead the u s team into the stadium tonight im very excited
2182880 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2182881 beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today
2182882 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcoholic beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 percent or less beer the top alcoholic drink of college students
2182883 given the devastating problems caused by underage and excessive drinking much of it in the form of beer this policy makes little sense and flouts the core values of sports and learning
2182884 i think weve taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads
2182885 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
2182886 our bylaws lump together names images and likenesses and the names are being used now so well have to go back and look at this
2182887 we will need to go back and look at our options we certainly are not giving up our model of amateurism
2182888 im so glad youre not as shy as you used to be you have a great personality im totally surprised youre still single
2182889 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
2182890 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
2182891 weve just got to get some guys back who are on the dl and maybe if we can add here and there i think we certainly have a chance id like to be a part of it thats great
2182892 we were just really lucky that no one else had hired him he was the right guy at the right time we never had any doubts that hed be back
2182893 cito is going to have a big hand in what kind of staff we have here
2182894 its important that hes comfortable with the staff i think bringing gene tenace and nick leyva here was important to him at that time well see how it goes
2182895 ive given everything i can to be ready to compete at this olympic games
2182896 its best for me to step down and have another athlete fill my position this is something for me thats very tough because its end of my career and its not the way i had planned it
2182897 the expectations stay the same the vision doesnt change at all we still feel were medal contenders
2182898 we created a lot of chances and we were dangerous in the final third
2182899 people are going to try and stop us any way they can
2182900 they have to play like that otherwise well kill them
2182901 elbows were raised i dont know if they were trying to make us injured for the olympic games
2182902 it was physical it was just another game to us
2182903 it got very physical but it certainly was not one sided
2182904 any time you put the best teams in the world against each other its going to get competitive its going to get as physical as the rules allow and as the officials allow
2182905 zero tolerance policy against discrimination and harassment in the workplace
2182906 would it be all right if we just sat and spoiler space spoilers space spoiler space just in case
2182907 all we told him was tell the truth and cooperate
2182908 for us the most important thing is that our client is properly represented and we understand that with time everything will be solved
2182909 he still came into the gym and practiced his shot
2182910 im not going to say there was no way in the world they could have done that
2182911 but i dont think so i didnt see anything like that
2182912 it was one of the last names i would have expected to see
2182913 seriously one person cannot change the outcome of a game
2182914 if found guilty it would affect his eligibility to play in puerto rico
2182915 we are as surprised as the rest of puerto rico is
2182916 we understand that everyone is presumed innocent and we will wait until the evidence is presented
2182917 different kind of dude fest is about possibilities as guys we have a lot of limits on how we behave what we feel and who we connect with these are limits that keep us from emotional intimacy knowing our full selves being able to not know the right answer and from healthy vulnerability this comes with a pain that is oftentimes taken out against those closest to us women children and other guys that dont pay enough attention to their limits what if we came together to talk honestly about these gender expectations and punk what if we had space to explore the many possibilities of being acting and feeling that already surround us thats what different kind of dude fest is all about
2182918 exploring issues and initiatives related to gender equality gender based violence and new models of masculinity through the lenses of research politics community culture personal experience and opinion
2182919 joined together through our rage our pain and our hope to generate strategies and actions that prevent disrupt transform and heal sexual violence we are committed to challenging oppression in all forms because we recognize that none of us is free until we all are
2182920 let that eucharist be reckoned as valid which is celebrated by the bishop or by one to whom he has committed it
2182921 the sacrament depends on faith in the attached promise of god
2182922 the sacrament depends on the promise itself not on our faith in it
2182923 the regular bishops become enemies of the gospel or are unwilling to ordain
2182924 refuse to participate in the discussion as they have framed it
2182925 the priest who offers the eucharist is our lord jesus christ
2182926 this book is thoroughly scriptural all that scripture says on the church it says all that it says scripture says

2182928 have you ever been at a banquet or in a boutique or at a concert or a meeting or a company where the vibe was incredibly positive i think you know what i mean a time and place where there was an overflow of positive energy you felt surrounded by possibility or people who believed in you or just felt like buying or eating or talking a lot the vibe changes everything its a place you want to work or a restaurant you want to come back to i remember the first time i walked into fast companys offices i remember the original legal seafoods and i remember just a few weeks ago the buzz in the lobby of the pdf conference in ny if vibe is so important why does it sound flaky to worry about it whos in charge of the vibe at your place could it be better a lot better changing the vibe isnt always possible but most of us rarely try from physical layout to organization to what leaders say and do it matters sometimes its all that matters

2182964 that was as a result of all of the media about our farmers are struggling and this was more a push on the residents side
2182965 weve been doing local for as long as i can remember but its been a bit more of a topic out there with the general population so this is where the idea came from that maybe we could do it and give our residents more of a visual effect of what we do
2182966 its a logical thing for us because most of our residents being of the age they are their background is family farms so their concern is whether were supporting local because of where theyre coming from

2183327 if we had a strengthening of the dollar that would help
2183328 wto why india and china said no to u s
2183329 you cant isolate what happens to indian farmers because of wto policies from what is happening in the world economy
2183330 with the crisis on the financial market a huge amount of money moves to the commodity markets leading to a commodity bubble in a condition such as that if you open up agriculture then the farmers could gain but thats not going to sustain anything for a long while
2183331 asking weaker countries to dismantle their own protection measures without doing the same in their own countries
2183332 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged

2183339 science is a wonderful thing but it is at the end of the day a tool
2183340 there was always the lingering question as to whether you would ever really be able to find differences that would be useful in terms of doing attribution
2183341 finding that you could really apply many of the same parallels with human forensics to microbial forensics
2183342 my recommendation would clearly be to not wait until something happens again because it may not be with anthrax
2183343 theyve got a heavy lift to convince the scientific world theyve nailed it
2183344 if they were engineered by dr ivins its highly unlikely that they would pop up anywhere else
2183345 their case hinges on the fact that these strains came out of this particular flask
2183346 if things continue as they are there would be a substantial cut in fuel prices next month something in the order of between 78c l and 90c l or even r1 l is possible
2183347 over the long term the pressure on energy resources is still going to continue there is still likely to be a long upward trend there may be a temporary reprieve which could last until october or november before we start to see another upswing
2183348 a lot of the fall in the oil price is sentiment it is not driven by fundamentals
2183349 in such situations especially of horror sometimes one could see anyone dressed in white which could be a similar description provided if one would ask about 50 persons how a ghost looks but i am still not convinced if it were the americans
2183350 americans do not carry out their operations in the form of using one of their agents to assassinate a president it could have been white people from other countries from east africa
2183351 the 1980 coup set the political opportunities that the americans enjoy indicating that it was after the coup that he along with dr togba nah tipoteh met the american embassy political officer at the executive mansion
2183352 i had a passion to seeing my people free i never entered cape mount county with troops as it was alleged
2183353 but surprisingly a friend in abidjan called me and informed me of a list that came from america with some 45 names including mine
2183354 taylor had political greed therefore i could not work with him because i knew that from the names of those on the listing of mr taylor he was staging a revenge and not a revolution
2183355 i do not believe in the better of two evils i moved over to sierra leone where i remained until taylor unleashed his plans on our country and people i later moved over to the ivory coast and met with the ivorian defense minister and told him of what was happening in my country and asked if whether his president was aware all he told me was that his president had said that if the palm oil has wasted there is no need to step in it around the room and i understood it anyway
2183356 blaise sent 700 commandoes and guinea also sent troops to help taylor some so called political leaders who were in sierra leone with some preachers signed a document saying that they should give their support to taylor and after six months he would turn over power and that there would be election not even knowing that some of them were already listed for taylors execution plans
2183357 how can someone lead a revolution wherein none of his own kind was eliminated it was only the children of the people that were killed including jackson e doe and others that was a conspiracy and our intention was to stop them
2183358 the activisms of the 80s were necessary to address the problems associated with the 70s and the activisms of the 90s were necessary for the injustices of the 80s if that is radicalism so be it
2183359 when treated as a human you will behave as a human but when you are treated as an animal you behave indifferently i think we made the right choice eventhough we made mistakes serious mistakes of moral cowardice and recklessness being full of passion
2183360 can you imagine just to name a few of the injustices and humiliation at the time my younger brother was taken from school at the b w harris only to join others during a parade to condemn his own father my father while i was then in freetown
2183361 we are all part and parcel of what happened in liberia some way some how you will need foreign experts from ghana or somewhere to rewrite liberias history if everything is to be documented because no liberian was neutral

2183368 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favorites like andoria and qonos
2183369 our forefathers were poorer than we are and yet they had better stuff relatively speaking
2183370 our grandparents had to delay that gratification they figured that if they had to save for it theyd better get the best they could now retailers want to catch that fleeting desire
2183371 nigeria is confident on the ball they have two very good strikers the americans are more of a team on the same level they dont have anybody extremely good
2183372 your schooling may be over but remember that your education still continues
2183373 the purpose of a liberal education is to make you philosophical enough to accept the fact that you will never make much money
2183374 the young graduate is discovering that among the necessaries of life the most important is living
2183375 there is no need to reach high for the stars
2183376 sooner or later we all discover that the important moments in life are not the advertised ones not the birthdays the graduations the weddings not the great goals achieved
2183377 a great many college graduates come here thinking of lawyers as social engineers arguing the great constitutional issues
2183378 the function of the university is not simply to teach bread winning or to furnish teachers for the public schools or to be a centre of polite society it is above all to be the organ of that fine adjustment between life and the growing knowledge of life an adjustment which forms the secret of civilization
2183379 the things taught in schools and colleges are not an education but the means of education
2183380 the advantage of a classical education is that it enables you to despise the wealth that it prevents you from achieving
2183381 a college education is not a quantitative body of memorized knowledge salted away in a card file
2183382 the whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows
2183383 the trouble with learning from experience is that you never graduate
2183384 dont ever dare to take your college as a matter of course because like democracy and freedom many people youll never know have broken their hearts to get it for you
2183385 a graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that individuality is the key to success
2183386 the direction in which education starts a man will determine his future
2183387 a graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that individuality is the key to success
2183388 we know what we are but know not what we may be
2183389 some men see things as they are and ask why
2183390 a fellow told me he was going to hang glider school
2183391 at my graduation i thought we had to marry what we wished to become
2183392 i have learned this at least by my experiment that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dream and endeavors to live the life which he had imagines he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours
2183393 commencement speeches were invented largely in the belief that outgoing college students should never be released into the world until they have been properly sedated
2183394 a milestone passed new things begun dreams as shining as the sun a goal achieved a victory won
2183395 it is indeed ironic that we spend our school days yearning to graduate and our remaining days waxing nostalgic about our school days
2183396 iipm has been removed from ranking as we received serious complaints about the veracity of information given by them
2183397 heres to spending the rest of my life between the legs of my darling wife
2183398 i won the prize for the best toast of the night

2183401 yeah he told me and i was a bit surprised myself you know hes only been there twice in the last four years once he fell asleep and the other time i had to pull him by the ears to make him come
2183402 since youve been such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world your reward is you can hang out with anyone you want to in heaven
2183403 okay so you were the one who invented the harley davidson motorcycle
2183404 well whats the big deal in inventing something thats pretty unstable makes noise and pollution and cant run without a road
2183405 professional to professional you have some major design flaws in your invention 1 theres too much inconsistency in the front end suspension 2 it chatters constantly at high speeds 3 most rear ends are too soft and wobble about too much 4 the intake is placed way too close to the exhaust 5 the maintenance costs are outrageous
2183406 well it may be true that my invention is flawed
2183407 but according to these numbers more men are riding my invention than yours
2183408 thats because you have had your product out for a longer period of time you have created a monopoly though now admittedly a very small fraction of men are trying out other options and finally your product has no resale value infact it costs more to get rid of than to acquire it
2183409 i find that the harder i work the more luck i seem to have
2183410 i am going to make it even if it takes working long hours and late nights for the preparation
2183411 each problem that i solved became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems
2183412 this is so lengthy how can a person ever attempt the whole section
2183413 thank goodness i practice on it i can do it now
2183414 i did not get good enough marks because i messed up
2183415 its now or never i have to make it happen

2183422 describe one incident where you took on a leadership role
2183423 we promote them in our advertisements and we have their coupons in our stores
2183424 we help each other because we are in a similar situation
2183425 each partner invites his or her own customer base and gets exposure to the collective attendees
2183426 show them that there is some reason to come into your store
2183427 the minute you add an incentive you make it an active referral and that increases the likelihood that a customer will try it
2183428 they get access to way more customers than they could ever get on their own
2183429 the price of fry oil has gone through the roof
2183430 i literally spend 150 000 a year in fry oil
2183431 it allows us to have a little longer life span on the oil
2183432 you cant reduce a portion too much or people dont think theyre getting enough for the money they spend
2183433 if the restaurateur notices that a majority of customers are leaving substantial amounts of french fries on their plates he or she may serve less of those while keeping the other items the same stretching the fry supply a little further
2183434 most people will ship you merchandise the easiest method that they have available but that is not necessarily the best way
2183435 canada has an unprecedented opportunity to enhance our global competitiveness by bringing broadband internet services to hundreds of communities
2183436 weve been successful at setting up the basic camp but now were on standby and waiting for better weather conditions
2183437 its been a challenge people need to bend over because the winds are really moving pushing them around
2183438 i think its a very good idea keeping an eye on whos coming what foreigners are coming and to keep an eye on any rogue ships or submarines that are not friendly as they say in military terms
2183439 we captured the elk before the ticks had dropped off in late spring and weve held them until all the ticks have dropped off

2183445 such improvements in governance are critical for aid effectiveness and for sustained long run growth
2183446 bribery around the world is estimated at about 1 trillion 494bn and the burden of corruption falls disproportionately on the bottom billion people living in extreme poverty
2183447 the united nations reiterates its zero tolerance policy towards sexual exploitation and abuse and stresses its determination to work with our troop and police contributing countries to ensure that all un personnel are held accountable to the highest standards of behaviour
2183448 member states in their statements underlined the need for african countries to contribute to ensure that the african predominant character of the mission is achieved
2183449 we believe we have enough available troops on the continent to contribute significantly to the mission in darfur but also to contribute to our mission in somalia
2183450 the fact remains that guinea bissau as well as other countries in the region that are coming out of conflict need more and sustained support from the international community if they are to consolidate peace and address the socio economic and other root causes of conflict
2183451 like in many other countries in africa aids is having a devastating impact on the lives and economies of communities in guinea bissau
2183452 we must all work together to promote womens empowerment as a way to fight hiv and aids

2183469 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2183470 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2183471 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2183472 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2183473 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2183474 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2183475 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2183476 we must look at the substantial successes we have been able to achieve but also reflect on how far we have to go
2183477 governments in the past have been complicit in genocides land seizures massive environmental degradation and many other human rights abuses because indigenous peoples were denied their fundamental rights and freedoms
2183478 this shows how far we still have to go to make sure that states acknowledge and protect indigenous peoples rights for if they continue not to we have many examples of the grave results
2183479 appropriate legislative or administrative measures to prevent the acts of transnational corporations on indigenous territories
2183480 reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states can take many forms that differ from country to country
2183481 generally it involves recognition for past injustices justice for victims and the healing of relationships
2183482 the result of more than two decades of negotiations the declaration provides a momentous opportunity for states and indigenous peoples to strengthen their relationships promote reconciliation and ensure that the past is not repeated
2183483 a manifestation of reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states and a mechanism for carrying that reconciliation forward
2183484 the wider public must understand indigenous peoples rights and concerns
2183485 they must act to protect them because as the most marginalised group in this world it spells out how the rest of us will be treated and is also the surest way to protect our last remaining ecosystems
2183486 we discussed the question of mobutus funds and my government is prepared to restore the money to the dr congo as soon as possible
2183487 there may be hard times now but things will get better soon
2183488 the proposed remedies should help farmers provided that the ombudsman is given sufficient powers to deal with the supermarkets bully behaviour
2183489 real competition comes from promoting a range of choices from large supermarkets to smaller shops not just by encouraging the big chains to face off against each other
2183490 weve seen the power of some of the bigger operators grow consistently over a period of time we really need to redress the balance
2183491 its time retailers were allowed to get on with delivering for customers
2183492 the competition commissions proposed remedies will help farmers provided that the ombudsman is given sufficient powers to deal with the supermarkets bully behaviour
2183493 the competition test recommended by the competition commission will do nothing to help local shops or to promote real retail diversity unless it is combined with strengthened planning rules to restrict supermarket expansion it could simply mean that we get more big supermarkets being built next to each other
2183494 youre not listening to the soundtrack to brokeback mountain or something
2183495 we began the new financial year confidently with a good start in the uk excellent progress in our established international markets and promising early performance from our investments in future growth particularly in the us china and turkey
2183496 we are very encouraged by the start fresh amp easy has made whilst it is still early days the response of customers to our offer has surpassed our expectations
2183497 this is a very competitive industry from which consumers benefit hugely
2183498 we hope that the regulatory authorities will give due weight to this and to the need to avoid costly and burdensome new regulation
2183499 it was a technical glitch due to an audio problem with the tape

2183502 statistics compass shown that instances of teen drug addiction escape in continued chains from parents to children
2183503 for some the vicious cycle of teen drug abuse begins at familiar when they are influenced by the addictive behaviors their parents exhibit for example children of alcoholics coas are a party of individuals who suffer the plight of their parents alcoholism
2183504 as a teenager the likelihood of exposing to drugs and alcohol is genuine high and there is a congenial chance that you testament effort drugs and alcohol
2183505 however the deed of addiction to drugs and alcohol can conclusion in some appealing undesirable consequences such as loss of friendships health problems behavioral problems alienation of family and a loss of care in sports academics hobbies etc
2183506 end this is a discreet and non invasive way always enshrine that teenagers can be fully protective of their privacy instead of asking your babe about his or her friends launch a barbeque organization and interrogate your baby to invite some of his or her friends

2183508 i got a great big house on the hill here and a great big blonde wife inside it and a great big pool in my backyard and another great big pool beside it sonny its money that matters
2183509 so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own
2183510 people in different countries and from different cultures share a passion for good food and do not want to see the distinctiveness of their own food and shopping experience eroded by the spread of the big bland supermarkets this international day of action shows that local communities are prepared to stand up against giant companies to defend their food culture
2183511 people in different countries and from different cultures share a passion for good food and do not want to see the distinctiveness of their own food and shopping experience eroded by the spread of the big bland supermarkets
2183512 not the pondlife consumerist chavs who like to shop in supermarkets disliking supermarkets because they are
2183513 this international day of action shows that local communities are prepared to stand up against giant companies to defend their food culture
2183514 it gets to the point where that is obstructive to our inquiry
2183515 if it takes up to two months then it is eating in to a lot of time that we have to make prosecutions
2183516 and they are very careful not to do much about fraud their position is that they are just a middleman that connects buyers to sellers the rest is up to you if you are defrauded they want you to go to law enforcement not to ebay
2183517 they actively do not work to shut down fraudulent sellers or auctions because to do so would be to assume liability which is precisely what they dont want to do
2183518 i probably hit more golf balls on monday than any single day in the last five years so i certainly worked up an appetite
2183519 but even more its good to just sit down for a few minutes and truly enjoy this incredible pga tournament experience
2183520 i dont know golfers really unless theyre tiger woods i dont even know who the favorites are
2183521 he was with somebody else in golf attire and they had a little booth to themselves
2183522 he ordered the rack of lamb people definitely recognized him but they left him alone not one person approached him which was nice
2183523 freddie couples was in with his wife monday or tuesday night
2183524 i see customers going to tables for autographs thats how i know
2183525 touring pro justin leonard was in for dinner on tuesday i believe with a party of seven or eight
2183526 he ordered the pasta del casa and on wednesday night we had natalie gulbis from the golf channel and the whole crew the producer and that british guy with the gray goatee four of them i recognized from tv
2183527 based on what happened last time during the ryder cup i entertained all of them including tiger all of them were here for dinner they took over the got rocks lounge privately and they all had a good time
2183528 eighty per cent of all the nations food shopping spend now goes through supermarket tills
2183529 i dont know whether ill give it a good review or not

2183531 they like to hunt and forage in open areas and grasslands
2183532 its largely an opportunity for researchers to come use this site for environmental and ecological research and thats where the barn owl project fits in
2183533 being able to take part in something like this were really looking forward to it
2183534 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus

2183543 mum and i just saw you on four corners they showed footage of john howard walking to the wheat enquiry so we were looking for you and there you were in the foreground smiling at your good luck at being on the spot we were quite excited
2183544 position is that the spirit is encased in the apostolic witness to christs redemptive acts out of which the baptized community of believers has its origin from this witness to and within this community the spirit gives the scriptures inspiration has its origins in the spirits accompanying jesus acts and words this culminates in jesus fully giving the spirit at his crucifixion and resurrection to his apostles from and through whom the new testament documents possess their inspiration and authority the spirits working on the writers cannot be isolated or divorced from the historical incarnation of the son of god and his words and deeds but it is an extension of them as they were witnessed and preserved by his followers who are recognized by their being baptized
2183545 scriptures derive their authority from jesus through the apostles not the other way around the earliest creeds from which our apostles creed evolved were not mere human formulations but jesus own self understanding that believers at their baptism confronted and responded to in creeds you are the christ the son of the living god thomas confession my lord and my god is the foundation of christian truth belief in the god whom jesus revealed and the confession made at baptism were not disparate things but they constituted one reality in which the spirit worked god can only be known in the one who died for sins and rose again just as jesus disciples were given the full revelation of god in baptism as father son holy spirit so the same revelation is given to subsequent baptized generations
2183546 no other moment in the churchs life is so specifically trinitarian as baptism and every recitation of the creed is a response to that moment
2183547 having gone therefore make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
2183548 the contents of the rule of faith will not be a surprise to any orthodox christian
2183549 i am assuming you dont have a problem with that
2183550 well thats great that means we can do what we like and it doesnt matter

2183554 we are at a turning point for high streets and town centres if the government follows the flawed advice of the competition commission it will be signing a death warrant for our high streets and for independent shops by making it even easier for the supermarkets to build yet more big out of town mega stores instead it needs to introduce new rules to restrict out of town development and promote real choice of local independent shops to meet every day needs
2183555 by encouraging more edge of town and out of town stores the government is set to increase car based shopping trips at a time when it claims that tackling climate change is a priority it should be looking for ways to cut car dependency and associated carbon dioxide emissions
2183556 weve got good local shops and you only have those evil supermarkets

2183606 rod if you think that a telstra blog operated on a domain owned by telstra and run by telstra staff is not comment that is legally bound to telstra then youve been given bad advice
2183607 i think it is very sad that telstra needs to sink so low in trying to get their message across
2183608 telstra needs its own site to lash out at its critics as the rest of the country press commentators etc discussing the issue in a more democratic fashion apparently dont agree with them they are even prepared to pay an employee to do their bashing and it looks to me that many of its employees then add their bits to it as well strange way of talking to the rest of the country

2183619 theres some relationship between belief and prayer but were not saying exactly what it is
2183620 that we may obtain this faith the ministry of teaching the gospel and administering the sacraments was instituted
2183621 that the law rule of prayer establishes determines the law rule of belief
2183622 that the law of what is to be prayed should establish the law of what is to be believed
2183623 the presidential system of government that we operate today makes no provision for a government of national unity
2183624 we also believe that joining the government of national unity will negate all that weve stood for throughout all the years which is multi party democracy
2183625 we are operating a federal system of government which is not like the american system
2183626 whereas in the united states of america the president appoints his ministers and these ministers are directly responsible to him here theoretically it is the same but so many factors are at work we have what is called federal character the various states have to be represented the various zones must be represented and of course you have special interests so what actually determines appointment here is not merit

2183635 we are just like dogs returning to their own vomit
2183636 pastor isaac made this analogy about how we should love
2183637 we are expecting the unexpected our preparations are constantly changing
2183638 climate change must be a wholly legitimate subject of protest and demonstration but if it is met by an arbitrary destructive and aggressive police response the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent law abiding people particularly the young
2183639 what we are doing is part of a long tradition of civil disobedience
2183640 were not blas about breaking the law but the threat that new coal poses to our future on this planet more than justifies the actions we are taking
2183641 the searches have been absurdly over the top with everything from 26 foot banners to disabled access ramps taken away
2183642 its a concerted attempt to demonise people and alienate members of the public so they dont think it is safe to come here its a depressing a chilling attack on the right to freedom of expression and assembly
2183643 the climate change debate in the workshop was of a higher calibre than in the house of commons
2183644 we headed to the gymnastics stadium where we gathered with the rest of the athletes from the world to await our long walk to the opening ceremonies there were people lining the streets everywhere to cheer us on ironically we actually missed most of the ceremony since we were either walking or assembling the walk moved very slowly through the streets of beijing and everyone was sweating like crazy from the heat we entered the stadium to the roar of the 100 000 people walking in behind our american flag was one of the most amazing experiences we got back to the olympic village about 1 30am and the party is definitely on in beijing now its time for us to go do our thing on the playing fields

2183661 it gave me a skill set where you say well what else can this do
2183662 if you obey the rules and design a creature based on biology or something that did exist then people go oooh that looks real
2183663 its a fantastic relief not to have to worry about the length of their teeth and the size of nostril hair
2183664 so i could add an extra sabre tooth to the gorgonopsid and no one cared because this is drama
2183665 i think that will really endow the event with a new energy
2183666 weve been looking at wanting to produce an evening luminaria walk like the ones in victoria and vancouver british columbia around capitol lake in au gust
2183667 instead of walking around seeing booths people dance in bon odori
2183668 people actually create by getting out in the street and dancing we create the very activity that were coming to watch and thats a beautiful thing that is what the procession is all about

2183687 anthrasimias may also be the oldest anthropoid in the world
2183688 i think that the fossils provide a few tantalizing clues that are consistent with an early presence of primitive anthropoid primates in asia
2183689 but i think that to have real confidence in the conclusions we need more material from the skeleton of this animal anthrasimias so from its cranium limbs and hands and feet
2183690 what we can say from the teeth is that these animals were also probably largely or significantly insectivorous
2183691 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down

2183710 were one like a dead man to feel a longing for any beloved object from ones earlier life this window for example then it would appear as it does so now to me the lifeless objects in ones presence can awaken a longing which one ordinarily recognizes only at the sight of a person one loves

2183723 the harder they tried to achieve consistency and uniformity the worse were the effects the more they tried to shrink variation the larger it got they were naturally also interested in cutting costs when any kind of error mistake or accident occurred they went to work on it to try to correct it it was a noble aim there was only one little trouble their worthy efforts did not work things got worse they were failing to understand the difference between common causes and special causes and that mixing them up makes things worse sure we dont like mistakes complaints from customers accidents but if we weigh in at them without understanding then we make things worse
2183724 common cause variation is the routine variation to be expected because of what the process is and the circumstances in which it exists and operates
2183725 suppose that when things are going well we say to people

2183761 indias dedicated focus on hiv prevention is fetching dividends we are seeing the beginning of the stabilization of the hiv epidemic in india
2183762 indias targeted hiv intervention approach which relies on strong community participation has resulted in larger numbers of people accessing hiv prevention treatment and care services
2183763 structural discrimination against those who are vulnerable to hiv such as sex workers and msm must be removed if our prevention care and treatment programs are to succeed
2183764 section 377 of the indian penal code which criminalizes men who have sex with men must go
2183765 this may be the first time a physical signature for a personality disorder has been identified
2183766 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
2183767 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
2183768 both prophylactic and therapeutic regimens proved successful apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
2183769 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
2183770 have you ever been a member of the communist party
2183771 have you ever left the us to avoid being drafted into the armed forces

2183773 do you plan to practice polygamy in the u s
2183774 the poly shack come in and get your hot maritals
2183775 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2183776 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness to this enmity
2183777 among the old abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra among the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra among the women ayesha ra and among the girls fatima ra
2183778 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is living alone in the house and is always busy in the worship of allah who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2183779 when jafar al sadiq entered the palace i saw a big python with him his two lips were open one was on the upper side and the other was below the throne the python told me if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you along with your throne when i heard this i was afraid of python and i did not know what i was telling to jafar al sadiq so i excused him and became unconscious
2183780 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart became black
2183781 oh abu suleiman you are also a pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2183782 oh son of the prophet allah gave you such a greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all the muslims
2183783 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grandfather will stop me and will ask me that why i have not fulfilled my duties properly allah will not see the inheritance but he will see the good deeds
2183784 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet his habits are superior his grandfather is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proud of his deeds
2183785 oh son of the prophet you do not need our recommendations because your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2183786 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are living in the loneliness and not coming out of the house
2183787 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not be seen again and people are busy with their own thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2183788 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2183789 the inside dress is for the allah and other one is for the mankind
2183790 the animals can do these things as they recognize who beats them and who loves them
2183791 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and can choose one good thing which is more good out of the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad out of the two bad things
2183792 you have all the qualities of a pious person you have kindness and coolness like the family members of the prophet but you have more proud
2183793 i am not proudy but my lord is great so when i discontinued meeting people proudness and greatness has overpowered me one can feel proud upon allahs greatness but one should not be proudy for his own greatness
2183794 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2183795 oh allah i do not have trousers and dress with me
2183796 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2183797 have you not heard what allah said to prophet moses pbuh that you cannot see him
2183798 his heart has seen allah but other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2183799 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there is no eagerness and passion then allah will not be there
2183800 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2183801 when he was calling others for his help then he was not correct so he was adviced to take care of the window opened in his own heart
2183802 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things so for this saying he will become an unbeliever
2183803 one who commits sin with fear and seeks allahs repentance he will become closer to allah the one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept away from allah one who is proud for his worship he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2183804 who is better a sincere pious person or a wealthy person
2183805 pious person is better than the other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2183806 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship as allah said
2183807 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2183808 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2183809 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2183810 one who fights against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2183811 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2183812 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic then this is the work of unbelievers
2183813 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i came to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2183814 allahs heaven and hell are in this world when there are no worries it is heaven and when there are worries it is hell it is heaven when we should approach allah for all our works it is hell when we surrender all our works to nafs i ammara
2183815 what separates this program from the rest of online business is the product itself for it teaches the number one rule that almost all other programs fail to teach and that is how to market oneself and drive immense amount of traffic to ones website which in turn converts to sales he also states that without traffic your business is just a sitting duck and this is where the program comes in and educates the newbie that is why it is not surprising how members get there site listed in top search engine like google in under 5 to 6 days
2183816 people everyday get into an opportunity and get all ready to go but dont know what to do next so this is where they fail and then when the next best thing comes around they jump into that opportunity and get already to go again but then again dont know what to do and this is where they lose money that is why the is the perfect online business for it eliminates this very problem with the educational products in place and the simplicity of video training that takes away all the guess work so its not surprising how is turning everyday average people in to six figure earners in a very short period of time
2183817 everybody i want emails from you will email me now

2183823 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2183824 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his sunnah the prophets teachings and also you will take precautionary measures and will differentiate between the false and true of sayings of the prophet
2183825 oh abu hanifa you were given life to show my sunnah so leave your loneliness
2183826 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2183827 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2183828 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2183829 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2183830 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2183831 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2183832 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2183833 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2183834 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2183835 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2183836 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2183837 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2183838 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2183839 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2183840 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2183841 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2183842 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2183843 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2183844 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind either you will become an unbeliever or will be away from the religion because if he would say if allah wills your knowledge will guide them and it will be equal to the knowledge that is known when that man would say no then you will become an unbeliever and if he says yes then you will be away from the religion
2183845 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2183846 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2183847 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2183848 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2183849 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2183850 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2183851 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2183852 ive finally found someone i can vote for and give my wholehearted support for their candidacy

2183855 sekalipun macam pemerintah tidak bangun kamipun pahamilah seperti itu kita bangun sendiri asalkan dokter mau datang ke sini macam guru mau datang menjar anak anak di sini cuma itu saja kalau pemerintah tidak mau bangun macam puskesmas dan sekolah di sini
2183856 dari awal sampai sekarang tidak akan mau direlokasikan sedangkan belum berhasil lalu tidak mau apalagi sekarang sudah banyak penghasilan untuk mau direlokasikan warga dongidongi tetap mati hidup masyarakat punya sikap yang ada sekarang
2183857 mati hidup kami tidak mau direlokasi karena selama kami tinggal di dongidongi dibandingkan dengan keberadaan kami di desa asal betul betul lebih ada peningkatan kami rasakan setelah kami tinggal di dongidongi ini sekalipun pemerintah tidak akui sama kita
2183858 sementara ini kesepakatan kita ya menghendaki supaya itu kan namanya kawasan konservasi jadi tetap harus dilestarikan fungsinya kita kembalikan sebagai kawasan yang harus kita lindungi bersama sehingga kita dari pihak departemen sudah komunikasilah dengan pemerintah daerah yang intinya supaya masyarakat dipindah tapi dalam rangka cara cara pemindahan yang wajar dan layak sehingga dicarikan tanah yang memadai untuk mereka bisa bertani di sana
2183859 siapa yang melanggar aturan yang menebang di kemiringan atau melewati batas yang sudah ditentukan maka dia itu didenda secara hukum adat dendanya siapa yang melanggar aturan adat itu menambah lagi perambahan dia di denda satu ekor sapi a
2183860 sebenarnya yang harus dikuatkan oleh balai taman nasional adalah proses zonasi kami sendiri belum mendapati ada zonasi yang jelas bahwa ini zona inti zona pemanfaatan dan zona studi nah itu yang tidak dijelas sampai hari ini dijelakan oleh balai taman nasional jadi ketika tidak ada batas batas itu masyarakat juga tidak boleh disalahkan ketika dia masuk ke wilayah rambahan yang menurut mereka itu adalah zona inti itu juga soal tapal batas yang di lapangan yang harus jelas masak setiap tahun tapal batasnya itu berpindah pindah yang jelas jelas di petanya ada apa yang dipeta tidak sesuai dengan yang dilapangan jadi mudah sekali menyalahkan masyarakat
2183861 walhi tetap pada posisi masyarakat seperti mereka menolak untuk direlokasi untuk ketiga kalinya ya tapi misalnya akan membangun komitmen baru dengan masyarakat kalau mereka tidak mau direlokasi sebaiknya mereka berkomitmen terhadap menjaga hutan itu jangan terpolarisasi dengan pengusaha pengusaha yang memanfaatkan mereka terus kalau pemerintah tetap ngotot untuk relokasi apa agenda tersembunyi di balik itu
2183862 dulu kami kasian di kamarora dijanjikan dua hektar lahan setelah kami tinggal di kamarora hanya nol koma delapan tidak cukup satu hektar
2183863 harus punya kesadaran bersama negara ini kan ada maaf ya terutama kelompok intelektualnya kelompok intelektualnya mereka harus berpikir bahwa negara punya aturan ada undang undang ada peraturan pemerintah yang harus kita taati bersama dan kalau kita sudah mulai upaya upaya tidak mentaati peraturan ya bagaimana negara itu bisa eksis kan namanya good governance didukung oleh tiga komponen yang sama sama taat undang undang eksekutif sebagai pelaksana legislatif sebagai perencana dan masyarakat kalau sudah berpikir ke sana mereka harusnya legowo kalau orang jawa ya harus ihlas kalau dipindahkan tapi pemindahan itu tidak ngawur tidak asal kita pindahkan kita ada proses multi pihak
2183864 kalau saya mau lihat kondisi masyarakat sekarang tidak takut mati masyarakat tidak takut mati apa saja terjadi kalau seperti itu masyrakat mau cari hidup di sini ada kehidupan lalu pemerintah seakan akan mau tindak atau mau pindah secara paksa kita tahu sendirikan apa sikapnya orang orang daa jadi yang saya khawatirkan juga saya tidak bicara bohong ini sekarang juga selama ini masyarakat dongidongi ilmu mereka cari dimana mana saya tidak bohong nanti kalau boleh dibuktikan ada masyarakat tidak dilihat manusianya kalau memang apa namanya sudah waktunya putus leher saya tidak bicara bohong ini nanti jadi di situ yang saya khawatirkan apabila pemerintah tetap mau bentindak pindahkan secara paksa masyarakat ya waktunya sudah mati dimana ini hari mati besok mati sama saja itu sikap masyarakat di dongidongi
2183865 sudah berulang kali saya tekankan saya kasih tahu bahwa masyarakat itu bukan merusak hutan masyarakat cari hidup bahkan sudah hidup di dongidongi sudah tujuh tahun
2183866 sebenarnya kami tetap mempertahankan agar masyarakat itu tetap mau menjaga hutannya dan sebagainya kalau mereka tidak mau
2183867 camera technologies can benefit directly from these advances we believe more generally that many new application possibilities will emerge from the ability to integrate optoelectronic devices onto curved surfaces bring electronics to the human body in the form of advanced biomedical devices is one broad area of possible application
2183868 we would like to explore the ability of these types of approaches for implantation into the human eye for people who suffer from degeneration of the retina many other problems mainly in the area of biocompatibility and bio interfaces would need to be solved first however
2183869 the novelty is that we are able to conform convention 2 d planar optoelectronics technologies onto curvilinear surfaces such as those of a hemisphere this type of capability can open up new design avenues for advanced camera systems in which not only the lenses but also the geometrical layouts of the detector arrays can be optimized for performance
2183870 the devices that we were able to achieve involve the detector arrays conformally integrated with a hemispherical surface with the size geometry and overall layout of the human eye the imaging characteristics of these devices are better than those possible with planar layouts when simple single component optics are used

2183876 the author missed the other side of the equation which is that most blacks will vote for mr obama just because he is black i think it is sad commentary for any white or black to vote solely on the basis of skin color
2183877 the topic of the piece today is laughable at this point i might expect a high school essay getting handed in on it but really voa sen obama has been overwhelmingly accepted as a viable engaging credible presidential candidate write about the person defined in terms pertinent to what they are trying to become

2183883 todo o poder emana do povo e em seu nome ser exercido
2183884 la ucr y el pj tienen s ndrome de abstinencia de poder
2183885 estos partidos se han caracterizado por ser los due os del poder siempre y tener actitudes desagradables de conspiraci n constante cuando no est n en el poder
2183886 el ego smo de un sector importante del peronismo que es la conducci n nos ha llevado a perder el gobierno los municipios los concejos deliberantes y las legislaturas
2183887 cuando yo no estaba en el gobierno y lo escuche a javier da fonseca hace mucho tiempo hablar de una conspiraci n todo el mundo levant las voces en contra de eso y yo siendo espectadora de esta situaci n ya me daba cuenta que hab a mucho inter s y mucho s ndrome de abstinencia en los partidos pol ticos mayoritarios incluyendo el m o por el problema que tienen con el poder
2183888 lo llamo s ndrome de abstinencia porque dicen que el ari no ejecuta pero nadie dice que el ari lleva ahorrado 500 millones de pesos quiz s el ari puede tener un mont n de defectos pero yo puedo decir que se trabaja con honestidad transparencia y respeto que pocas veces he vivido y he sido funcionaria de otros gobiernos
2183889 no puedo decir que el peronismo es un partido que no sabe gobernar digo que esta conducci n partidaria ha llevado al peronismo al fracaso esto es evidente
2183890 hay intendentes que est n pensando en el 2011 y utilizan a los gremios para generar conflicto en lugar de generar propuestas
2183891 a mi me toc estar en reuniones de gabinete donde hay una autocr tica constante no es cierto que el gobierno sea indiferente al murmullo social pero c mo se puede encauzar un gobierno con el caos que dej hugo c ccaro
2183892 estoy desde hace dos meses en el ipra el presidente acaba de firmar un convenio con canal 11 por casi 200 mil pesos de deuda del a o pasado un convenio con canal 13 por 250 mil pesos de deuda del a o pasado hemos gastado 10 mil pesos en prensa durante 7 meses y pagamos 300 mil del a o 2007
2183893 aplaudo a la gobernadora que se est bancando todo esto cuando otro gobernador y hemos tenido muchos hubiese puesto en disponibilidad a toda la gente nadie dijo nada con la baja salarial durante la poca de carlos manfredotti y hoy que tenemos 5 mil empleados mas dicen que el gobierno no hace nada cuando en realidad est sosteniendo a un pueblo para que pueda comer es lo elemental

2183923 sepanjang harga bbm tidak naik tidak akan ada dampak ke masyarakat memang ada tekanan yang sangat berat terhadap apbn jika pemerintah tidak menaikkan harga bbm dalam negeri mungkin akan ada pos pos apbn yang dikurangi untuk nomboki subsidi bbm
2183924 dengan keputusan harga minyak yang sudah dipatok untuk apbn 60 dollar as sementara harga minyak dunia mencapai 80 dollar as pemerintah harus kuat menanggung biaya pembengkakan yang akan terjadi
2183925 tetapi kalau memang terjadi defisit dan komposisi apbn berubah kondisi sosial sangat mungkin terpengaruh karena adanya perbedaan sedemikian besar antara apbn dan harga minyak dunia
2183926 nah ini akan membuat kalangan industri terpaksa melakukan phk pemutusan hubungan kerja saja
2183927 uang ini bisa untuk nombokin defisit apbn dikembalikan dulu soal kuitansi tidak lengkap harus konsultasi dulu kantor pusat itu nanti karena berbelit belit padahal temuan bpk ini temuan awal dan ada kemungkinan asas kriminal kalau menunggu setelah ditindaklanjuti sehingga masih lama
2183928 doc tidak bisa dikurangi lagi komponen biayanya apalagi sekarang pemerintah ketat mengontrol kelayakan pesawat terbang
2183929 kemungkinan besar fuel surcharge naik kami masih mengamati fluktuasi harga minyak dunia
2183930 untuk konsumen lama harga yang kami tawarkan negotiable harga tawar menawar bisa dinegosiasikan apalagi mereka biasanya sudah terikat kontrak jangka panjang dengan kami
2183931 soalnya sedikit atau banyak barang yang dikirim kami kan tetap menyewa pesawat yang ukurannya sama kecuali kalau barang barang itu bisa dikirimkan bersamaan dengan kargo yang lain
2183932 itu sebabnya kenaikan fuel surcharge sedikit saja akan memberatkan konsumen beda dengan di luar negeri yang masyarakatnya sudah terbiasa
2183933 biasanya kan pajak dibebankan 10 persen kalau pemerintah bisa mengurangi jadi lima persen saja itu kan sudah menolong
2183934 jika kondisi geopolitik ini terus memanas kenaikan harga minyak bisa mencapai angka 100 dollar as per barrel
2183935 industri yang akan banyak terbebani dengan kenaikan harga minyak adalah yang yang padat menggunakan energi di antaranya tekstil perikanan pabrik sepatu semen dan plastik
2183936 seharusnya mereka sudah beradaptasi dengan melakukan efisiensi dan mengganti bahan bakar minyak dengan bahan bakar lain yang lebih murah seperti batu bara dan gas
2183937 di satu sisi kita didorong menggunakan batu bara tetapi di sisi lain kementerian negara lingkungan hidup klh masih menilai limbah batu bara termasuk bahan berbahaya dan beracun
2183938 ada anggota kami menggunakan limbahnya untuk membuat batako dan tiang listrik tapi kemudian didatangi polisi karena dinilai izin kami hanya membuat tekstil bukan membuat batako padahal itu upaya untuk mengatasi masalah limbah batu bara
2183939 ke depan seharusnya ada petunjuk pelaksanaan yang jelas bagaimana industri industri ini bisa mengonversikan energi dari minyak ke batu bara atau sumber energi lain yang lebih murah
2183940 industri lokasi di mana dan sampai berapa lama akan memakai batu bara juga jaminan ketersediaan pasokan untuk industri dalam negeri harus jelas
2183941 kami sudah berkali kali melakukan penertiban dan razia tetapi perdagangan ilegal masih saja marak
2183942 daerah penghasil memang mendapatkan keuntungan dari kenaikan harga minyak dunia sedangkan daerah tidak harus menanggung subsidi
2183943 namun batu bara menimbulkan polusi yang cukup tinggi sehingga dituding tidak ramah lingkungan
2183944 kendalanya terutama investasi yang sangat besar dibandingkan dengan minyak bumi apalagi batu bara ini disebabkan kegiatan pengeboran dan eksplorasi merupakan kegiatan yang padat modal dan membutuhkan teknologi tinggi
2183945 jika terlambat indonesia bisa mengalami krisis energi karena konsumsi energi dalam negeri terus meningkat
2183946 padahal jika dikembangkan energi alternatif semua pihak baik masyarakat maupun negara sangat diuntungkan kuncinya adalah keberanian pemerintah melakukan investasi dalam pengembangan energi alternatif
2183947 begitu pun lampu penerangan jalan raya tidak perlu menggunakan listrik bertenaga diesel seperti dilakukan sejumlah daerah tetapi memanfaatkan listrik tenaga surya
2183948 kuncinya adalah kemauan politik dari pemerintah untuk menghapus subsidi minyak dan mengalihkannya untuk mengembangkan energi alternatif yang terbarukan
2183949 sektor industri sebenarnya tidak perlu dipaksa mereka akan mencari sendiri energi yang bernilai ekonomis dan efisien asalkan tersedia dalam jumlah memadai
2183950 the ioc sets great store by the quality of the the football tournament

2183952 of course i can say i am concerned this situation will have to end
2183953 i have agreed with mr blatter we review it after the games i appeal to the clubs concerned werder bremen schalke 04 and barcelona to leave the players in china
2183954 let them live their dream like ronaldinho who is not one of the players involved in the controversy said it is his dream to play in the games
2183955 we have to let the players realise their dream just like the basketball players and the
2183956 i appeal to the clubs to observe the olympic truce till after the games
2183957 i am sure we can reach an agreement and that fifa will absorb it into their international calendar we will fight with mr blatter
2183958 we will then simply not have an olympic tournament we could of course revert to a beach football or five a side competition
2183959 they could say let them play but we want compensation is that the olympic spirit
2183960 we cannot have players withdrawn from the tournament and see them return home putting in danger the competition before it starts

2183969 it should be an s shape and you want to make sure the colors normal because the color of the poop tells you a lot about how you made it
2183970 you dont want pieces food is a medicine for you it helps you if the stool is in pieces by the time you finished digesting your food you dont have enough of it left to poop out in the right way and probably its hurt the colon that has to process it at the end of the day you can analyze your body really effectively by looking at what comes out of your body

2183974 estamos viendo que el ipv no puede resolver el problema de chacra xiii y quiere culpar al municipio y a los concejales de no poder entregar las viviendas por eso estamos elaborando un dise o que resolver esto
2183975 hay una decisi n entre los concejales y el ejecutivo municipal de tomar el toro por las astas y resolver el problema no solo al ipv sino el nuestro el ipv debe resolver su problema interno de redes en chacra xiii y nosotros le vamos a resolver el problema externo
2183976 la provincia es responsable de entregar las viviendas en tiempo y forma frente a los compromisos que han asumido pero lo que estamos viendo como ciudad es que el tema servicios no est resuelto entonces para no empezar a echar las culpas a otros el municipio decidir hacer una fuerte inversi n para la infraestructura necesaria
2183977 estimamos que costar unos 12 millones de pesos y se proyecta que podr a dar respuesta por los pr ximo 40 a os en la ciudad frente a todo el crecimiento que vamos a tener porque ya tenemos chacra xi con problemas porque no nos podemos conectar con chacra xiii la nueva urbanizaci n que proyectamos tambi n se nos complicar entonces estamos atados a la decisi n final del ipv por eso hemos decidido hacer sta inversi n importante para resolver todo esto
2183978 el municipio puede hacer un esfuerzo de sta naturaleza frente a la gran organizaci n administrativa que sostiene que no significa ser rico sino bien administrado pero no vemos lo vimos desde el otro sector pol tico que est n a las vueltas no es culpa de sta gobierno porque es algo heredado pero deber a haber compatibilizar con la ciudad para resolver stos problemas
2183979 la sociedad es la que no est de acuerdo en que esto se haga a pesar que no son l quidos contaminantes pero est n sometiendo a los concejales a una situaci n de dimes y diretes cuando no tienen nada que ver entonces ahora proponemos sta inversi n que solucionar el problema y pondr blanco sobre negro si el ipv realmente puede entregar las viviendas que lo haga pero deber hacer el esfuerzo para que hasta que este concretado este ducto utilice camiones atmosf ricos como lo hace el municipio en chacra xi
2183980 con todo esto el ipv no tendr ninguna excusa para no entregar las casas por eso vamos a convocar la pr xima semana a una reuni n con los legisladores concejales y autoridades del ipv para que de una vez por todas podemos resolver el problema tan acuciante que tiene la ciudad

2184033 the senate today chose political expediency and the illusion of property tax relief over a real meaningful solution a restructuring of our property tax system based on equity income and ability to pay
2184034 a circuit breaker would reduce property taxes for senior citizens and working new yorkers those who need relief the most basing property taxes on income and ability to pay not an arbitrary number dreamed up by an albany commission is the right direction for new york state
2184035 without a doubt a tax cap will further divide the haves from the have nots hurting poor children more because tax caps lock in existing funding inequities in addition poor communities simply do not have the ability to raise local funds to support their schools
2184036 its a good concept but it comes without adequate funding while we support the goals of this bill passing it as a separate bill is an empty gesture
2184037 we will continue to work with the assembly and the governor to see that this bad policy bill will not become a bad law
2184038 new york should not make the same mistake we will continue our discussions with the governor and legislative leaders to find efficiencies and savings and lower property taxes without hurting children and public schools

2184068 target tersebut didasarkan pada kondisi peta politik dina mis hasil pemilu 2004 di tiap daerah
2184069 sikap parpol yang menjadikan pilgub sebagai landasan un tuk menghadapi pilpres 2008 merupakan hal yang wajar da lam praktik politik karena saling keterkaitan antara dina mika politik di daerah dengan di tingkat pusat apalagi jabar memegang posisi strategis sebagai daerah penyangga ibu kota dengan jumlah pemilih yang cukup besar yakni sekitar 29 juta calon pemilih maka seringkali dinamika politik di ja bar dikaitkan dengan pertarungan politik para elite di jakar ta
2184070 semua tahapan pilkada itu rawan baik itu tahap pencalonan penetapan calon pemungutan suara penghitungan suara maupun penetapan pemenang
2184071 selama ini pelaksanaan pilkada di jawa barat relatif aman dibanding daerah lain hal ini terjadi karena ridla allah rasa ikut memiliki dari warga jawa barat dan sinergitas antara pihak kepolisian dengan semua pihak terkait
2184072 kondisi ini menjadi tidak cantik karena memunculkan ke san pemekaran wilayah itu muncul dari suara individu yang digiring menjadi suara publik padahal seharusnya itu di ba lik dengan semangat perubahan menuju peningkatan kese jahteraan yang lebih baik seorang individu harus membawa suara publik
2184073 kemungkinan besar tidak akan menguat karena untuk memunculkan wacana pemekaran diperlukan penyan dang dana yang cukup besar agar bisa mendorong berkem bangnya gerakan sosial dan gerakan politik menuntut peme karan dan jika hanya kepentingan politik sesaat apalagi ti dak didukung kekuatan politik dan kapital yang signifikan a kan sulit mendorong berkembangnya tuntutan pemekaran

2184081 this new agreement is a natural extension of the card issuing agreement we signed with american express more than two years ago
2184082 we have started a two way dialogue with our customers and they told us they wanted more places where they can use their american express cards in russia and that is what we will be doing to fulfil their needs and desires as part of our continuous commitment to customer satisfaction we will ensure that american express cardmembers from russia and all over the world will have the opportunity to use their american express cards in the locations they choose
2184083 this agreement demonstrates american express commitment to and confidence in the russian market rsb is already doing an outstanding job of creating valuable american express products and services designed to meet the needs of russian consumers
2184084 i am confident that this agreement will allow american express to enhance the value it provides to merchants by expanding card acceptance to places where our high spending cardmembers want to use their cards and will ultimately contribute to the growth and development of the payments industry in russia
2184085 we were the first bank with foreign ownership to issue cards in russia passing the half million milestone is a very good result for any bank and is particularly significant for us banking cards were one of our first products when we entered the retail market in 1999

2184089 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2184090 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2184091 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2184092 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same so you should be grateful for meeting such a great friend of mine but after this you will not see him again
2184093 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2184094 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2184095 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2184096 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2184097 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2184098 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2184099 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from haram illegal things and for the pious persons asceticism is to desire for more and more halal legal things to keep themselves away from all the things which keeps away a man from allah this is asceticism of mystic persons

2184103 oh allah do not take back faith from the believers
2184104 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2184105 oh allah every thing is in your control and you are having command of all the things with you so allow me these things and do not ask what i need

2184120 our objective is to contest in the elections and work alongside the sri lankan government and other democratic tamil political parties we as a party have actively participated in changing the attitudes and mind sets of the tamil diaspora that have been supportive to the ltte terrorists and have been instrumental in convincing them that supporting the ltte is not going to bring them peace or resolution
2184121 the fact of the matter is that the ltte are unable to digest the increasing popularity of the tmvp eros epdp and so on not to mention the ever growing support from the tamil diaspora who are learning more about the brainwashing tactics and propaganda being used by the ltte to win support

2184143 the university of timbuktu never existed the only thing that existed in timbuktu was a small mud hut the arabs had where they taught a few of the half breeds to memorize the koran they never even learned to read but the people who are trying to exalt the negro past have gone into that sort of thing and theyve spoken of the school of timbuktu and then somebody quotes that and it becomes a university and then it becomes quite a tremendous cultural center this is ridiculous

2184194 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
2184195 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy
2184196 no for me the tigers life of one minute is better than the jackals life of 1000 years
2184197 now i got the correct information about tipu sultan that his dead body is there in front of north gate of the fort under the pile of other dead bodies so please follow me upto there
2184198 yes she is an orphan hindu girl and her father was died in the last war the sultan had adopted her as his daughter
2184199 i do not know about her may be she belongs to the royal family
2184200 we are his murders and not all of you we had murdered him and our coming generations will put flowers of respect on his grave
2184201 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2184202 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him he also described that he does not know any other person who did such a great favour to the islamic religion
2184203 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2184204 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2184205 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2184206 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2184207 have you got any chance for doing any sin even though you had power of doing it but due to the fear of allah you escaped from it

2184210 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2184211 it was good that the person was in baghdad if that person would have been in rome then all the romans would have accepted the religion of islam
2184212 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2184213 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2184214 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2184215 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2184216 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2184217 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects try to be a great worshipper of allah they will not get any benefit from their wealth whereas you will be benefited more because of allahs blessings their wealth will remain here in the world they will not carry this to their grave on the contrary the reward of worship to allah will help you to remain pious we all will die one day let us worship allah to have a pious soul
2184218 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2184219 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword

2184231 habr a que ver qu es lo que hay detr s del apoyo del ari a la usurpaci n
2184232 en esta ley se juntan una ideolog a de la gobernadora y de varios de sus legisladores del ari con las ganas de hacer sonar a los intendentes en realidad se trata de mezquindades pol ticas e ideolog as erradas
2184233 por otro lado ad nde va el dinero que ya estaba destinado a construir la infraestructura no se sabe muy bien es todo medio dibujado
2184234 los intendentes tendr n que defender su parte y hacer lo que les corresponde
2184235 algunos empresarios de la construcci n que traen gente y en lugar de darles o proporcionarles gamelas para que vivan dignamente la mandan a usurpar
2184236 todos sabemos porque adem s los vimos que entre quienes usurpan terrenos hay camionetas al lado de cuatro chapas
2184237 en realidad eso es lo que no se transparenta al igual que ocurre en la ley anterior
2184238 esta cuesti n reci n se va corregir cuando haya transparencia

2184254 the west won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion to which few members of other civilizations were converted but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence westerners often forget this fact non westerners never do
2184255 a peaceful mass of people carries out slowly and patiently an unstoppable invasion the most important in human history
2184256 it seems to be slowly returning the southwestern united states to the jurisdiction of mexico without the firing of a single shot by means of a steady spontaneous and uninterrupted occupation
2184257 history shows that amnesty for illegal entrants only encourages more to illegally cross the border
2184258 almost all politicians reporters radio and television commentators professors and others customarily refer to the millions of invaders as undocumented workers or guest workers or job seeking immigrants
2184259 but the reality is that the millions who have come here uninvited have thumbed their noses at our laws and entered the united states illegally their invasion has produced many serious consequences the illegal immigrants have created enormous financial drains on states and communities where they have migrated forced many hospitals out of business because of having to care for immigrants who have no funds inundated the schools and demanded that they receive instruction in their native language they have also filled the prisons with their criminal element
2184260 american military personnel should be stationed at the border our militarys presence alone would deter invasion
2184261 we can kiss the u s constitution goodbye tear up the declaration of independence and see america converted into a carbon copy of the many previous despotic regimes across the world
2184262 the united states enjoyed a period of unprecedented prosperity consumerism and economic optimism
2184263 at the middle of the decade the united states with 6 percent of the worlds population and 7 percent of the area produced almost half of the worlds manufactured products
2184264 never it seemed had so many had it so good and never had so many expected it to get better
2184265 to many observers of the american scene the old adage the poor will always be with us was a thing of the past
2184266 men in their 30s today earn less than men in their fathers generation and family income growth has slowed
2184267 i got my cpa i work in a big accounting firm what is going to happen to me in this system
2184268 in ten years we are going to be doing a lot of the stuff that is being done in america today
2184269 i have just learned that in many small and some medium sized hospitals in the us radiologists are outsourcing reading of cat scans to doctors in india and australia
2184270 most of this evidently occurs at night and maybe weekends when the radiologists do not have sufficient staffing
2184271 any activity where we can digitize and decompose the value chain and move the work around will get moved around
2184272 some people will say yes but you cant serve me a steak true but i can take the reservation for your table sitting anywhere in the world in other words there are parts of the whole dining out experience that we can decompose and outsource
2184273 the impact of job loss is far reaching individuals families and the entire community have all been negatively touched distress extends not only from the loss of jobs but also from the more profound loss of an entire way of life
2184274 ive begged ive totally begged you know for help to get me straightened out so i could go back to work
2184275 but everywhere i went ive just been turned away we cant help you and i said you know its a shame ive worked all my life now i need some help and i cant get it
2184276 we have family members people employees of the organization whose families have worked in the textile industries that have lost their jobs every time somebody loses their job theyre losing health insurance for their family if they have to choose between going to the doctor or putting food on the table theyre going to put food on the table versus going to the doctor families need steady work
2184277 we are witnessing something that would have been unimaginable a quarter century ago the emergence of a house of representatives and a senate that ignore the will of the majority of americans the middle class
2184278 committed to a world order that views national sovereignty and borders as inconvenient impediments to trade and commerce and our citizens as nothing more than consumers or units of labor in a global marketplace
2184279 the twenty first century began with more than three million manufacturing jobs lost in the first five years of this new century
2184280 unfortunately a rapidly changing post modern economy is less uplifting and is putting more downward pressure on millions of our fellow americans
2184281 for the first time in our history americans arent dreaming of a better life for their children they are desperately hoping that their children wont be forced into a lower standard of living and lower quality of life
2184282 well that is doris brown would you like to meet her
2184283 masanya akan tiba pada umat manusia ketika tidak ada apapun yang berguna selain dinar dan dirham
2184284 wahyu menyatakan mengenai dinar dirham dan banyak sekali hukum hukum yang terkait dengannya seperti zakat pernikahan hudud dan lain sebagainya sehingga dalam wahyu dinar dirham memiliki tingkat realita dan ukuran tertentu sebagai standar pernghitungan untuk zakat dan lain sebagainya dimana sebuah keputusan dapat diukurkan kepadanya dibandingkan dengan mata uang lainnya telah menjadi ijma ulama sejak awal islam dan pada masa para sahabat dan tabiin bahwa dirham menurut syariah adalah 10 dirham setara dengan 7 mithqal dinar emas berat dari satu mithqal emas setara dengan 72 butir gandum maka dirham yang tujuh per sepuluh darinya adalah 50 dirham dan dua per lima butiran gandum semua ukuran ini merupakan hasil ijma
2184285 jika zakat menjadi wajib apapun bendanya akan dihitung dinisab berdasarkan sifat dan jumlahnya bukan berdasarkan nilainya seperti yang terjadi pada perak emas biji bijian dan buah apabila sifat dari benda tersebut tidak memiliki keutamaan dalam hal zakat maka benda tersebut akan diperlakukan sebagaimana halnya tembaga besi atau yang sejenisnya
2184286 segenap puji bagi allah dan rahmat dan kedamaian bagi junjungan kam sayidduna muhammad rasulullah
2184287 tidak ada zakat yang dibayarkan atasnya sebagaimana zakat diwajibkan atas hewan ternak beberapa jenis biji bijian dan buah buahan emas perak nilai dari pendapatan dagang dan barang simpanan barang yang disebutkan di atas segel sultan tidak termasuk ke dalam kategori tersebut
2184288 engkau akan melihat amal dari penjelasan mengenai hal ini pada koin tembaga atau fulus yang dicetak dan diberi segel sultan yang ada dalam peredaran di mana tidak ada zakat yang dibayarkan atasnya karena tidak termasuk ke dalam kategori yang wajib untuk dizakatkan
2184289 dalam kitab al tiraz disebutkan abu hanifa dan menyatakan dengan tegas pembayaran zakat atas koin receh karena keduanya mempertimbangkan pentingnya membayar zakat atas nilainya di sebutkan juga bahwa terdapat dua perbedaan dalam pendapat asy syafii ia menyatakan bahwa sikap mazhab yang menyatakan tidak mewajibkan zakat atas koin receh tidak ada perbedaan pula bahwa koin receh dilihat dari nilainya bukan dari berat dan jumlahnya jika zakat menjadi wajib apapun bendanya akan dihitung dinisab berdasarkan sifat dan jumlahnya bukan berdasarkan nilainya seperti yang terjadi pada perak emas biji bijian dan buah apabila sifat dari benda tersebut tidak memiliki keutamaan dalam hal zakat maka benda tersebut akan diperlakukan sebagaimana halnya tembaga besi atau yang sejenisnya
2184290 dan allah segenap puji dan sembah baginya maha bijaksana semoga allah memberkahi dan memberikan kedamaian bagi junjungan kita nabi muhammad beserta seluruh keluarganya

2184301 jika pedangmu berada di tanganmu maka aku akan lanjutkan pertempuran ini tetapi karena pedangmu patah maka aku tidak boleh menyerangmu
2184302 kalau aku punya pedang saat ini aku akan memutuskan tangan tanganmu dan kaki kakimu
2184303 kamu bersumpah kalau memiliki sebuah pedang di tanganmu maka kamu akan membunuhku sekarang kamu telah memiliki pedangku karena itu majulah dan seranglah aku
2184304 di dalam agama allah tidak ada perkelahian atau permusuhan antara kamu dan aku kita bersaudara perang yang sebenarnya adalah antara kebenaran dan kekurangan kebijakanmu yaitu antara kebenaran dan dusta engkau dan aku sedang menyaksikan pertempuran itu engkau adalah saudaraku jika aku menyakitimu dalam keadaan seperti ini maka aku harus mempertanggungjawabkannya pada hari kiamat allah akan mempertanyakan hal ini kepadaku
2184305 tiada tuhan melainkan allah tiada yang ada selain engkau ya allah
2184306 musuh yang sebenarnya adalah sifat sifat buruk yang ada dalam diri kita engkau adalah saudaraku tetapi engkau meludahi mukaku ketika engkau meludahi aku aku menjadi marah dan keangkuhan datang kepadaku jika aku membunuhmu dalam keadaan seperti itu maka aku akan menjadi seorang yang berdosa seorang pembunuh aku akan menjadi seperti semua orang yang kulawan perbuatan buruk itu akan terekam atas namaku itulah sebabnya aku tidak membunuhmu
2184307 tidak pertempuran adalah antara kearifan dan kesombongan antara kebenaran dan kepalsuan
2184308 meskipun engkau telah meludahiku dan mendesakku untuk membunuhmu aku tak boleh

2184337 is probably a plus for the economy in the long run
2184338 outsourcing is just a new way of doing international trade
2184339 i estimate that somewhere between 22 percent and 29 percent of all u s jobs are or will be potentially offshorable within a decade or two
2184340 the total regulatory burden on manufacturers is estimated at 162 billion
2184341 this represents an increase of 10 2 percent since 2000
2184342 exceed estimated 2005 individual income taxes of 894 billion and are far greater than corporate income taxes of 226 billion
2184343 bring the federal governments share of the economy to 29 percent compared to 27 percent a year ago
2184344 those rules will impose at least 13 7 billion yearly in future off budget costs
2184345 u s manufacturers and consumers of mineral products that are critical to the u s economy depended on other countries for 100 percent of 17 mineral commodities an increase of 6 percent over 2003 and for more than 50 percent of 42 mineral commodities an increase of 8 percent over 2003
2184346 a ceo has to make the decision to stay in the u s and not get a return for those years or go offshore
2184347 the permitting requirements are so onerous they are driving investment away offshore where there can be a much quicker return
2184348 of great concern to u s manufacturers is the sharp rise in the cost of energy particularly natural gas
2184349 seasonally adjusted price of natural gas has more than doubled from 4 per thousand cubic feet to 8
2184350 the united states enjoyed a 30 percent cost advantage with regard to natural gas on a trade weighted basis
2184351 the steady increase in u s prices since then is purely the result of policy decisions that have limited development of domestic reserves and clean air act mandates that have increased demand
2184352 the corporate tax burden was both the heaviest burden in absolute terms and the largest contributor to the deterioration in the u s structural manufacturing cost gap adding 2 0 percentage points to the u s cost disadvantage this is largely due to the fact that u s statutory rates were unchanged even as several other trading partners continued to lower their rates
2184353 equivalent to a nearly 9 percent increase in the overall manufacturing tax burden
2184354 the excess tax burden of u s manufacturers relative to their foreign competitors has worsened considerably in the past three years
2184355 in all likelihood employment will begin to increase more quickly before long as output continues to expand we have reason to be confident that new jobs will displace old ones as they always have
2184356 the problem america faces is not a lack of educated people but a lack of jobs for educated people in the 21st century the us economy has been able to create net new jobs only in domestic services such as waitresses bartenders and health and social services the vast majority of these jobs do not require a college education and they do not produce tradable goods and services that could be exported or substituted for imports

2184377 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2184378 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity

2184380 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is in loneliness in the house and busy in the worship of allah and who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2184381 when he entered his palace he saw a big python with him and his two lips were open and one was on the upper side and the other was below of the throne
2184382 if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you with your seat
2184383 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart become black
2184384 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2184385 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2184386 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2184387 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2184388 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2184389 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2184390 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2184391 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2184392 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2184393 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2184394 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2184395 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2184396 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2184397 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2184398 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2184399 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2184400 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2184401 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2184402 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2184403 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2184404 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2184405 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2184406 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2184407 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2184408 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2184409 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2184410 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2184411 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2184412 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2184413 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2184414 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2184415 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2184416 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2184417 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2184418 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind
2184419 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2184420 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2184421 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2184422 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2184423 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2184424 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2184425 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2184426 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2184427 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2184428 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2184429 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2184430 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2184431 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2184432 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you
2184433 oh owaise allah has blessed you granted his mercy and has forgiven you
2184434 oh harm the son of huban god bless you what thing you have brought here and who showed you my address
2184435 how do you know my name and my fathers name as i have not seen you before
2184436 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2184437 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2184438 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2184439 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2184440 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2184441 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2184442 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2184443 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2184444 whoever like the following three things for him hell will be near to nerve of his neck
2184445 take me to that person so that i can see him
2184446 oh man the shroud and the grave has kept you away from the allah and these two things are disturbing on your way
2184447 safety is in loneliness the person who is single and alone and who do not think about others in his heart is safe and secured because it is not good to think about others in loneliness satan devil will run away when two persons meet each other
2184448 one who is content on this then he will not require any thing from the mankind
2184449 a man is successful one who wake up hungry and sleep hungry but he should not forget the remembrance allah in that condition
2184450 one person requested him to advice him and he told him
2184451 it is difficult to control the tongue than to look upon the world and dinars and never say any bad thing to others
2184452 he want to explain about ascetic condition but could not explain the same because in which it will be praise for himself or there will be complain against allah
2184453 one who know allah then he should get lost himself permanently in the condition of surprise
2184454 allah will give respect to that person who will not look other than allah but no body has authority on allah true person will not be called true unless he has no balance in between fear and hope
2184455 for the money we get and for this money we should see that it is coming from halal right source and it should be spent for the halal purpose only
2184456 one who will desire of heaven and fear of hell and want the pleasure of allah then one should take care of it otherwise he will not be successful in the other world after the death
2184457 avoid the world because i have heard that the worshipper who likes the world and for this reason on the day of judgment the angels will announce that this person is one who liked the thing which allah does not like it he further continued that there is nothing in the world which will not finish because in the world no such thing made by allah which will not met its end in this world even some useless things attract the man so he neglects the big things of the heaven
2184458 all things depend upon two things first thing that is made for us and other thing which is not made for us so for the first thing whatever we will try to avoid it to get but it will reach us for the other thing for which whatever we will try for it to get but it will not reach by us
2184459 oh person you are product of this time so you prefer saying than actions and this is the time for the proud of knowledge and there is no importance of leaving action so you are bad people in the best time
2184460 my condition is to gain the favor of allah and to keep away from the mankind so one who gain favor of allah will be not see the mankind
2184461 first i will to try to convince my mind for the credit then i will take it
2184462 due to his thinking his body become thin and bones are visible on his body
2184463 inspite of this condition he is enough for the insects in the grave
2184464 the prophet came into his dream and conveyed his message that he should not over look his duties towards her mother which is better than performing the hajj
2184465 he saw her two eyes and was fallen in her love
2184466 he is ashamed to go to toilet daily due to the presence of two angels who are writing mens good and bad deeds
2184467 once people saw him in the winter in one simple shirt and his body was with sweat
2184468 long time ago some guests were in his house who took some soil from the neghbours wall without the permission of the owner so from that time to up till now when ever i look on the wall i regret for the act of my guests and this is the reason of my sweat even though the neighbor already forgiven me for this mistake
2184469 do you know any person who ignore others due to his frenzied condition
2184470 yes and ask them to wait for some time as he will come soon there
2184471 oh otaiba be pity on your condition and he replied her
2184472 oh allah if you punish me or forgive me and in the both conditions you are my friend
2184473 oh otaiba i love you so i have desire that you will not do any such thing which will cause separation of us
2184474 he divorced the world and at the time of meeting with you i will not look at the world
2184475 once some body told him that many persons used to ask about your affairs
2184476 that person asked for the fresh dates and as there was no season of dates at that time but at the same time he gave him a bag full of dates to him
2184477 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2184478 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2184479 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his
2184480 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2184481 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2184482 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2184483 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2184484 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2184485 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2184486 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2184487 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2184488 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2184489 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2184490 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2184491 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2184492 it was reported that a fire worshipper once imprisoned him
2184493 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2184494 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2184495 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2184496 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2184497 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2184498 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2184499 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind
2184500 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2184501 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2184502 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2184503 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2184504 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2184505 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2184506 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2184507 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2184508 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him
2184509 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2184510 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2184511 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2184512 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2184513 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2184514 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2184515 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2184516 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2184517 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2184518 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2184519 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2184520 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2184521 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects
2184522 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2184523 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2184524 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2184525 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he died in the year 204 a h at the age of 54 years 19 th
2184526 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2184527 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2184528 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2184529 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2184530 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2184531 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2184532 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same
2184533 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2184534 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2184535 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2184536 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2184537 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2184538 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2184539 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from
2184540 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2184541 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2184542 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2184543 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2184544 oh you are so old but you do not know the condition of worship in the private or public place and in both these places there is nothing which will stop the worship of allah
2184545 he rewarded for raising one of his hand and if he raised the another one then we will have given the reward for that hand also
2184546 since 500 years she was adorn for you but you are in condition of negligence
2184547 one night due to fear of allah you were weeping and due to the weeping there were tears in your eyes these tears have put on my face as powder and for this reason from that day there is brightness and shining on my forehead
2184548 he thought caliph a bad man but he never told this to the people in this matter so that people may not think me sincere and truthful and for this i will leave this world in insincere condition
2184549 if the well of zam zam will dry then which water he will drink
2184550 some persons asked with saleh bin abdul karim which thing is good in the following
2184551 both are good but hopefulness is better than the fear
2184552 he thinks that the foundation of worship is on the fear because hopefulness will keep us away from the worship the foundation of religion and world is on the fear so when there is control of hopefulness on the fear then hearts will not work properly if there will be increase of the fear then the worship will also increases
2184553 fear allah in such extent that there will be no disappointment from the grace of allah and do not keep too much hopefulness for which you will be out of fear from the punishment
2184554 the man whose heart is bright will not like worldly desires because that light will separate him from this world and take him towards allah
2184555 one who will return back from the goal will not be successful one who gets some sincerity in the life then he will feel happiness the sincere people will be kept away from doubts the true people when they want to explain the condition of their hearts but their tongues will not help them there are some persons who are in agreeable condition of allah but feel endurance as repentance for themselves because in that condition the man will claim for the repentance but the agreeable condition relates the willingness of allah so the repentance relates with the man and agreeable condition relates with allah
2184556 i like too much agreeable condition so if allah sends every body to hell then all will go there with helplessly but i will accept it with happiness
2184557 if a man busy himself in the worship then in the meadows of heaven the angels will plant trees for his each and every worship when the man ceases his worship then they also finish their work there one who leaves all his human desires truly then he will deserve for the reward from the allah
2184558 oh allah such person is not good for your service unless who will not act on your commandments
2184559 oh haroun honor of mysticism is great honor he used to say the meaning of humility which is as follows
2184560 the man should think himself low and he also told the example of persons who have passed away from the world are like medicine from which the persons were used to get cure but the example of present persons are like pain who are making healthy persons un healthy
2184561 in the past in which the preachers think preaching a difficult task same like the persons of present time find difficulty to act upon the knowledge in the present time there is shortage of learned people like the shortage of preachers in the past
2184562 it is very strange that allahs beloved person is taking help from his enemy
2184563 awouze billah min shaitan nirjaim wa bilhaqe nazalna wa bilhaque nazal
2184564 so when i came back to him and explained him all the details which happened on the way
2184565 oh allah at the time of doing sin i used to love your beloved friends so for this reason help me and forgive me
2184566 allah blessed him but he could not get the position of persons who are married in that world and suffered difficulties to maintain them
2184567 oh allah i have fulfilled my duty so you do whatever you like
2184568 oh abdullah you are very handsome so dont waste your youth and handsomeness in the disobedience of allah
2184569 oh allah as i am very bad so your beloved friend is my enemy as he is your beloved friend to whom i love him so for his sake forgive me
2184570 due to expectoration of aslam tosi who made this after ablution and due to fear of that sound i fell down from sky to the ground
2184571 to day i will be free from the worldly grief and sorrow
2184572 oh sorrow today muhammed aslam left this world and this world could not deceive him and he took with him excellence and qualities
2184573 as he left over the worldly affairs so there is no such great learned person like him
2184574 an old man is standing before me and prohibiting me in this matter and he is fath al mouseli
2184575 for the sake of charity it is good for the rich persons for the humility of poor persons but it more better that the poor persons should hate the rich persons
2184576 i am a traveler so i have right over the local residents and for telling this i have come over there that on such a place i will die by tomorrow so please arrange for my convalescence bath and bury me in these old clothes
2184577 oh fathe al mousali if i got the nearness of allah then i will give you reward for your service for me
2184578 to live in the world in such a way that life should become eternal
2184579 as per tradition of the prophet if some body get some thing without his desire then he should accept it otherwise it will be regarded as ungratefulness of allahs grace
2184580 when he heard this then he took one dirham so that there will be no ungratefulness
2184581 he acquired knowledge from abdals an order of saints for a period of 30 years and they advised me to keep away from the mankind and eat less
2184582 as the patient dies if we stop him giving food and water so in the same way without knowledge wisdom and the advice of saints the hearts of mankind will die
2184583 allah blessed him with his mercy and told him as you were afraid of sins and for this reason you used to weep so much so we have ordered the angles not to write any of your sins
2184584 after obtaining the goal there is no need of logic and guides
2184585 oven is hot and so it will be done as per his order
2184586 if a person not regretted by heart and if it is oral then it is useless if there is no efforts in the worship and in the mystic exercise then there is no escape from the sins
2184587 he is too much busy in the worship of allah so how he will look at them
2184588 if other hurries will know this matter that he is not interested in them then they will make fun of them
2184589 he will not see all of you now but on the day of judgement we can meet him there
2184590 he acquired knowledge from many pious personalities and met 300 pious persons but i think that there are only four of them are great pious persons and among them are abu torab is on the top of them
2184591 some time he eats at basra or at baghdad and some time he used to eat in makkah
2184592 due to his unluckiness such defects were find in them
2184593 you will not get mysticism because i have promised with allah that i will not put forward my hands toward haram illlegal things
2184594 he will not steal the goods as he is a great pious person
2184595 i have no objection for this trouble because my sole was undergone severe punishment of shame today
2184596 as you got the punishment for your desire so now you can eat this but the desire of your sole will be fulfilled after it will be punished
2184597 what is your opinion about revelation and miracles of your disciples
2184598 one who will not believe this then he will become disbeliever
2184599 one who has faith in allah will not require any thing with him
2184600 for a period of thirty years he did not borrowed any thing from others or not given any thing to any body
2184601 one person invited him but he did not accepted his invitation and for this punishment he did not ate any thing for fourteen days
2184602 a true person is one who feels pleasure of action before action is done sincerity is an action in which there is pleasure of worship
2184603 i do not have any desire with allah so i am happy for his approval and so allah can keep me in any condition what ever he likes
2184604 the eceased was the owner of the lamp in his life but now after his death his heirs are owners so it is not good to lit the lamp without their permission
2184605 my bravery demands me to wear the dress of mysticism and follow their ways the bravery which require from you is to take down the dress of mysticism and in this way by remembrance of allah you can attain good position so that the world may not attract you
2184606 his preaching will not be good for the mankind because he is a lover of the world and the preacher must have effect to guide the mankind then he should preach he should have sequence in his preaching and in his condition there should be divine help for him
2184607 why were so effective the styles of preachers who were passed away from the world
2184608 because they want to propagate the islam and want to control the sole in their preaching
2184609 the love of allah is better than the mankind do not disclose the secret matters always sit in the company of pious persons keep away from the company of ignorant persons and sit in the company of learned persons
2184610 one should think himself lower so that world may respect you
2184611 he should not be angry with any body for the sake of matters of the world
2184612 the meaning of zahed mysticism is to be content for what ever one gets and do not desire more than that
2184613 he is afraid of their condition of darweshi mysticism and so he is much concerned about this as they follow it properly or not than their wealthy condition
2184614 he will widen the means for his wisdom and sagacity as he respected his name
2184615 first he wanted to be free andsecond may allah grant repentance for his master and third he should get reward for the helping the darwesh person so he may get returned back his four dirhams
2184616 inspite of your bad characters i have blessed you and your slave and the persons who were present in that meeting and mansur amer
2184617 oh allah i have committed sins not due to disobedience but due to fraud of the satan and sole so forgive me due to your grace and kindness
2184618 oh the people of faith protect yourself your family members and your sole from the fire of hell
2184619 who is great learned person in the mankind and who is a great ignorant man
2184620 the great learned person is one who is obedient and having fear of allah the greatest ignorant man is one who is a poor and sinner
2184621 the heart of mystic saint is the center of remembrance of allah
2184622 the heart is source of light and if the desire of the world enters into ones heart then that light will finish in him and darkness will cover it
2184623 allah blessed him and asked him to do praise and eulogy for him in presence of angels same as he used to praise and eulogy for him in the other world
2184624 fondness is required for the absent one but allah is present for every moment
2184625 prophet younus pbuh thought that allah will not be angry with him but for him allah sent a great difficulty on him
2184626 to have faith in allahto be away from the mankindto speak sincerelyto bear the hardships of endurance for the right way
2184627 belief is the gift of light of allah with which one can observe the affairs of the next world as there will be no curtains for him
2184628 your wealth and children are problems for you but we ourselves are more problems makers than wealth and children
2184629 due to the blessing of allah man got the following four things
2184630 to live in the world without greed and lust and to live with broken heart is good for the next world
2184631 to acquire any thing which is not good for the next world is useless

2184696 my father edward discovered the mother virus in cooperation with lord spencer who was also a nobleman
2184697 edward and spencer studied it for the purpose of military use
2184698 when the progenitor virus is administrated to living organisms non human in this case violent cellular changes cause a breakdown in the system furthermore no satisfactory method has been found to control the organisms for use as weapons clearly greater co ordination at the cellular level is essential to enable further growth insecta perhaps because of these ancient animals have been genetically stable for millennia when administered with the progenitor virus they exhibited only explosive high energy growth and increased aggressiveness it is extremely difficult to envision using them as a bow amphibia injecting a frog with the virus resulted in an increase in leaping power and abnormal tongue growth however no change in mental ability is observed furthermore an abnormal resulted in the test subject randomly attacking all moving objects usefulness for bow is limited mammalia the progenitor virus was merged with the monkeys cellular dna resulting in an increase in fertility the resulting young exhibited improved aggressiveness and some increased mental capacity as a side effect the visual power was lost but this offset by an improvement in hearing ability however they were unsatisfactory as weapons it does seem that no progress can be made without making humans as the base organism
2184699 they learned from experience and are beginning to exhibit group attack behavior they are also ceasing cannibalism their evolution is exceeding expectations the leeches no longer exhibit individual behavior even when not feeding they move as a collective they consume everything i offer with remarkable efficiency
2184700 nov 10 1967 progenitor virus administered jessica administered virus type a plasmolyzing of tissue during cell activation virus fusion negative action disposed lisa administered virus type b plasmolyzing of tissue during cell activation virus fusion positive but delayed fusion body modification observed constant results status continue protective observation
2184701 rumour has it that theres something dangerous about those leeches
2184702 in order to manufacture the human biological weapon from the founder virus it was necessary to develop a variant with that particular peculiarity enhanced that was the t virus project birkin wondered if he could combine the mutated founder virus to enhance its peculiarity the sample of ebola virus had already arrived at his laboratory
2184703 apart from spencers intention birkin was engineering a biological weapon with increased emphasis on its ability to fight
2184704 there is now evidence that when the host loses consciousness the body goes into a dormant state
2184705 july 16th unfortunately the test production of b o w type y139 had to be suspended because of this investigation its the same with type y139 theres still so much we dont know about responses to the crustacean t virus theres a lot of interesting research left depending on the species and nurturing conditions only minute doses of t bring about remarkable changes in solidity size multiplication of internal toxins and brain development if these effects can be controlled a powerful weapon could be produced but the sudden development of the shell results in a corresponding fragility certain areas become exceedingly weak problematically one of these areas is the head carapace this lab we are going to were they pursuing the same research it would certainly help to find data and samples that would help us in our research july 19th the day is finally approaching i am growing more anxious the raccoon city newspapers and tv stations are full of reports about bizarre murders in the suburbs it cant be the virus can it if it is no i cant think of that now i have to concentrate on this investigation and make sure it goes smoothly
2184706 after discovering the remains of an ancient virus within the genes of a queen ant i have been concentrating on the research of ants the ecosystem of the ants seems truly ideal to me there is one queen ant in each anthill and the soldier and worker ants are the queens slaves
2184707 we are now at a major disadvantage against the other researchers as there is great competition in the field of t virus research i have disgraced the honourable name of the ashford family that out great ancestor veronica established if nothing is done umbrella will be taken over by spencer
2184708 i will suppress the activity of the virus at an ultra low temperature so that my cells will change slowly my calculations indicate that it will take 15 years before my body will gain immunity and become able to coexist with the virus
2184709 i used my otherwise useless father as a test subject however as i expected the virus caused a rapid change in his cells triggering the complete destruction of his brain cells and body flesh
2184710 a parasitic living body created by genetic modification that was nemesis a living body with intelligence which was unable to do anything on its own however once it parisitised the brain of another living being it would take full control of the body and demonstrate its highly developed aptitude for combat the project was to provide the intelligence and the biological body for combat separately and then combine them in order to create one living biological weapon
2184711 on the report attached to the sample we saw nothing but a long list of deaths the carriers lasted for only five minutes after nemesis took control of their brains
2184712 the discovery of the g virus was in fact 21 years after the administration of the progenitor virus
2184713 any beings infected by the g virus will reproduce through impregnation of an embryo within another living being unless rejected by the host the embryo will undertake a process of gradual cellular invasion infecting the hosts cells on a molecular level as it rewrites their dna once the metamorphosis is complete the host will be capable of continuing this cycle of self reproduction
2184714 thesis is that given control of a central banking system and an incontrovertible currency a currency not backed by gold a sovereign national government is finally free of money worries and need no longer levy taxes for the purpose of providing itself with revenue all taxation therefore should be regarded from the point of view of social and economic consequences

2184838 it was a soccer but you were only allowed one touch and if you shot the ball wide you were banished to goalie it seemed like an individual game but i soon realized the kids were passing it back and forth trying to get me to be the goalie
2184839 this was a special experience for me ive done community service before with the team but the difference with this one was being able to see the smiles on the kids faces and understand the impact we had
2184840 even though we expect some weakening due to the downturn in the housing market and auto industry that will be offset by the tight labor market and wage growth in other industries
2184841 hotels are busier with more guests and new hotels are being built to meet the increased demand
2184842 they need general mangers and directors of sales and marketing as well as hourly workers

2184895 india is one land but the rich and poor exist on apparently different planets virtually unreported are some awful daily realities the rate of malnutrition in children under five is a shamefully high 45 less than a third of indias homes have a toilet and most women have to wait until the dark of evening to venture out to answer the call of nature the talk of making poverty history sounds hollow in india a land which is home to a third of the worlds poor and where some 300 million people live on less than 1 a day
2184896 a typical annual salary for an indian it engineer is 5000 and for a graduate with a masters degree in business 7 500 about one tenth of their american equivalents
2184897 this project of corporate globalization has created a constituency of very rich people who are very thrilled by it they do not care about the hawkers being cleared from the streets or the slums that are disappearing overnight india is not coming together but coming apart because liberalisation has convulsed the country at an unprecedentedly unacceptable velocity
2184898 its creating an apartheid city making very clear separations between the rich and poor
2184899 the situation in the resettlement areas is horrendous far from the jobs and city services
2184900 now the government can only ignore it at its own peril
2184901 the irony is that the cpi m and its left front allies have played a major role in creating the myth that congress represents a secular and progressive alternative to the communal bjp yet as its support for the criminally culpable modi government amply demonstrates the congress will not shy away from adapting to and conniving with communal forces whether it be for reasons of political expedience or to uphold the interests of capital against the working class and the oppressed
2184902 indian business leaders have openly expressed their admiration for the chain smoking and austere bhattacharya saying they hoped his party bosses could emulate his pragmatic approach
2184903 moves that have often earned him the ire of his partys politburo members
2184904 we did have high expectations for tucson so being the busiest opening wasnt a total surprise
2184905 i know just what you mean because my boyfriend nick of the backstreet boys once slapped me with an open hand and i was like not cool and we totally broke up also i lost my dog once and i was totally sad
2184906 the delay is due to studies being made on the radio waves we are coordinating with the jordanian commission for regulating communications to regulate this department because the station would be on the border with israel which demands extreme caution against interference with israeli radio frequencies
2184907 the complications have just motivated us even more to make the voice of our society heard
2184908 the title is very symbolic for us because we live in an agricultural community far from the center of jordan and it is an area that is neglected when it comes to social services this program is our voice and specifically the voice of the women
2184909 when bethlehem 2000 started broadcasting our program we felt that our dream had come true even if only partly
2184910 what is important is to be heard in every household in the valley im happy that the heads of all the municipalities in the valley listen to our program and even respond to our remarks this has had a real impact on the women because they felt the media has finally reached the valley and what has been even more significant is the fact that it is the women who are speaking out
2184911 when i first heard of the radio station i anticipated many problems but after i heard the first episode on bethlehem 2000 radio i decided to participate because i realized it was the only opportunity for me to become active in my community and to help the girls transcend their traditional roles in society
2184912 my participation is about supporting women and men in realizing the roles that all community members play in their society
2184913 we are in terrible need for a voice to express our feelings as girls living in a community ruled by old customs and traditions that sometimes hinder a girls ambitions
2184914 government officials dont help with the weaknesses of the infrastructure which requires serious development i think the station will help propel the peoples concerns especially the womens to the higher levels of government
2184915 at the initial stage of the project i was running against time to have a scoop in the arab world a women run radio station in a community like the valley had not been done before and i knew the station would also prove that women were capable of leadership
2184916 rural society needs to be encouraged to do more for itself at first i was afraid the project would be rejected but since then i have delegated a great deal of the work to the girls because i saw how excited they were about the radio station
2184917 the project has increased my personal interaction with the community i now feel that i have a role to play in addressing womens problems and the people in my community
2184918 now i am unafraid to speak to government officials to follow social causes to search for the truth and to solve problems the journalism training has helped me with all of these things

2184949 a confirmation fight is exactly what the administration does not need
2184950 there has been a growing criticism of the administration favoring ideology over competence and this nomination smacks of that
2184951 americas top doctor should be a doctor for all americans and so i have serious reservations about nominating someone who would inject his own anti gay ideology into critical decisions about the health and well being of our nation
2184952 as with other nominees i will listen to the testimony of dr james holsinger but this administration must know that the united states surgeon generals office is no place for bigotry or ideology that would trump sound science and good judgment

2184959 this hell hadees or invisible world is divided into two very distinct and opposite regions by a broad and impassable gulf one is a seat of happiness a paradise or elysium and the other a seat of misery a gehenna or tartarus and there is a supreme magistrate and an impartial tribunal belonging to the infernal shades before which the ghosts must appear and by which they are sentenced to the one or the other according to the deeds done in the body egypt is said to have been the inventor of this important and valuable part of the tradition and undoubtedly it is to be found in the earliest records of egyptian history
2184960 you have made the word of god of no effect through your tradition which you have handed down

2184962 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon
2184963 you are those who justify yourselves before men but god knows your hearts for what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of god

2184967 there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day
2184968 but there was a certain beggar named lazarus full of sores who was laid at his gate
2184969 desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores
2184970 so it was that the beggar died and was carried by the angels to abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was buried
2184971 and being in torments in hades he lifted up his eyes and saw abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom
2184972 then he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame
2184973 but abraham said son remember that in your lifetime you received your good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and you are tormented
2184974 then he said i beg you therefore father that you would send him to my fathers house
2184975 abraham said to him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them
2184976 and he said no father abraham but if one goes to them from the dead they will repent
2184977 but he said to him if they do not hear moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead
2184978 the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god has been preached and everyone is pressing into it

2185017 under the federal government treasury circulars ref no f 15775 dated 27
2185018 contrary to the above circulars and the relevant laws the board of nigeria ports authority under the chairmanship of chief olabode george illegally conferred approval limit of n60 million on the board n30 million on the executive management n10 million on the managing directors n2 million on the executive directors n700 000 on the general managers and n500 000 on the ports managers
2185019 investigation revealed that the nigeria ports authority during the period under review awarded over 24 252 contracts valued at over n100 billion
2185020 during the period under investigation various contracts which ordinarily should have been referred to the federal executive council fec or the ministerial tenders board for approval were fraudulently split into many units by the board under the chairmanship of chief olabode george with the intention of circumventing extant government rules and regulations so that the contract amount would fall within the boards approval limits for the purpose of gain making by the board
2185021 during the period under investigations various contracts which ordinarily should have been referred to the federal executive council fec or the ministerial tenders board for approval were fraudulently split into many units by the board under the chairmanship of chief olabode geoge with the intention of circumventing extant government rules and regulations so that the contract amount would fall within the boards approval limits for the purpose of gain making by the board

2185255 as you can compare prayer with the charging of the spiritual batteries of the soul you can also compare adoration with the synchronization of the soul to receive the universal telecommunications of the infinite spirit of the universal father prayer is the sincere gaze that is full of aspiration of a child towards his spiritual father
2185256 it is possible that prayers for spiritual help and light will only receive an answer later when the one who said the prayer has reached the necessary level of consciousness when you consecrate to your heavenly fathers will all your requests will be fulfilled because your prayers will be in accordance with his will
2185257 avoid the danger of becoming egocentric in your prayers avoid praying too much for yourselves pray more for the spiritual progress of your brothers of your fellow man but especially of those who hate and persecute you
2185258 you cant observe the spirit acting freely in your thinking but there is a practical method to discover the degree in which you have abandoned the control of your psychic powers to the orders of the inner spirit that comes from the father it is the degree of your love for your fellow man this spirit of the father participates in the fathers love and when it dominates you it leads you infallibly towards the divine adoration and the affectionate consideration for your neighbour

2185456 after haymarket class conflict and violence continued with strikes lockouts blacklisting
2185457 the strikers with no resources left agreed to return to work their leaders blacklisted
2185458 in april in east st louis there was a battle between strikers and police seven workingmen were killed strikers could not hold out many of them were blacklisted
2185459 the subject was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted i will quote only one most curious remark dropped by this person we are not particularly afraid said he of all these socialists anarchists infidels and revolutionists we keep watch on them and know all their goings on but there are a few peculiar men among them who believe in god and are christians but at the same time are socialists these are the people we are most afraid of they are dreadful people the socialist who is a christian is more to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist the words struck me at the time and now they have suddenly come back to me here gentlemen
2185460 the object is to get the money by hook or by crook it doesnt matter
2185461 have you received food stamps in the past three months
2185462 well you signed the form didnt you we wont do anything to you
2185463 and all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need
2185464 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common
2185465 neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need
2185466 but whoso hath this worlds goods and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth
2185467 what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone
2185468 the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doors to the traveller
2185469 once i started i cant stop i do it all the time and cant quit
2185470 yeah this is my first time alans been pestering me to try it thinking maybe it will help take my mind off things
2185471 its been weeks since any pot has come through here and people are really really down
2185472 the oligarchy is always on the attack and trying to say you are no good
2185473 in venezuela where an oil economy has over the decades produced a sparkling elite of superrich a quarter of under 15s go hungry for instance and 60 per cent of people over 59 have no income at all
2185474 hes done incredible things for the 80 of the people who are poor there
2185475 i felt almost invited to go by pat robertson because he was encouraging that chavez be assassinated and i always can assume that whatever he says it ought to be the opposite
2185476 i think if people have oil in the ground they are called wacky
2185477 one of things said about him is that he shut down a television station
2185478 since 1998 they had been encouraging the assassination of chavez every day
2185479 the idea that there is no freedom of expression there
2185480 the loons of fox news are broadcast there every day
2185481 more towels in 7 it meant the shower room inhabitants would lay them on the floor and presto change o they had a foster pedic in nashville tn and sorting recycling at a 20 20 recycling bin in santa rosa ca
2185482 so tell me arthur is it true that most people lead lives of quiet desperation
2185483 pray as though everything depended upon god work as though everything depended upon you
2185484 it didnt occur to us that we were in any particular danger
2185485 we yelled at them and scared them away before i think they were pretty big grizzlies
2185486 toward dark around 9 p m on sept 15 we decided to hike out
2185487 we didnt want to go where the bears had gone
2185488 i told chris were going to go right through where the bears went so maybe he should get the pepper spray out i was yelling hey bear every 30 seconds or so just to keep them scared away
2185489 i put my arms up in the air and started screaming
2185490 he knocked me down his paw hit me in the chest right in the lower chest it didnt break the skin it didnt rip my clothes which i cant understand
2185491 is a stream of pepper spray going right down his throat
2185492 i wasnt conscious of the spray until it was going in his throat keith tells me the bear was swinging one paw at me at the time i shot the whole thing down his throat
2185493 he turned around and ran away 10 yards then he did a u turn and started charging again
2185494 i turned my back because i didnt want to see him get me
2185495 i thought im going to get mauled now and die i dont know why he didnt grab me
2185496 a lot of it is a blur but the first was the bear coming right at
2185497 and then the next thing i remember is the bear being right in front of me and it was crouched down
2185498 i remember i was in front of the bear and the only thing i was doing was screaming hey bear hey bear because i was just in total terror and panic
2185499 i got a little nick on my shoulder from the bear i dont know how that happened
2185500 earlier in the evening when we were wandering around wed found a deserted cabin that we didnt know was there before
2185501 we were pretty scared all night about two hours after it happened i had a little hyperventilation problem i went through
2185502 we were talking about it until we had ourselves so scared we decided not to talk about anymore
2185503 they said we dont blame you for not wanting to go back
2185504 ive never been that close to a bear before when i saw the bears
2185505 it was probably the most terrifying thing that has ever happened in my life ill never forget the bear being in front of me
2185506 neither one of us got harmed keiths a little scratched but thats it i think the bear was just protecting his territory
2185507 the attack came just hours before two pennsylvania hunters shot a grizzly bear in self defense after bear spray didnt deter the charging bear
2185508 then she whirled and came back over a log at them
2185509 if theyd walked 100 yards to either side they probably would have never known she was in there
2185510 if you want to understand how a particular society works you have to understand who makes the decisions that determine the way a society functions in the u s the major decisions over what happens in a society investment production distribution etc are in the hands of a relatively concentrated network of major corporations conglomerates and investment firms theyre also the ones who staff the major executive positions in the government and theyre the ones who own the media and are the ones who are in the position to make decisions they have an overwhelmingly dominant role in the way life happens whats done in this society
2185511 these are not just academic exercises were not analyzing the media on mars or in the 18th century or something like that were dealing with real human beings who are suffering and dying and being tortured and starving because of policies that we are involved in we as citizens of democratic societies are directly involved in and responsible for and what the media are doing is ensuring that we do not act on our responsibilities and that the interests of power are served not the interests of suffering people and not the needs of the american people who would be horrified if they realized the blood thats dripping from their hands because of the way theyre allowing themselves to be deluded and manipulated by the system
2185512 chomsky does not discuss these horrendous programs because it would awaken his readers to the cruelest fact that the u
2185513 meanwhile chomsky stays true to form ignoring these matters and instead calling for socialized federally controlled healthcare which would further subsidize the pharma cartel this is just another example of his bait and switch tactics a sloppy mess of disinfo and elite sponsored solutions
2185514 meanwhile the national institutes of health said rules designed to

2185516 however the dine navajo nation alone has a landbase equivalent in size to luxemburg lichtenstein and monaco combined or approximately as large as belgium the netherlands or denmark further the dine nation alone is richer in natural resources than all six of the above mentioned european nations combined by these measures indigenous north american people should by every standard be among the wealthiest and healthiest of populations instead by both us and canadian governmental accounts they are the very poorest strata of society experiencing far and away the shortest life expectancies and highest rates of infant mortality least education most unemployment and greatest rates of death by malnutrition suicide and exposure churchill and laduke hold that all this is the direct byproduct of the internal colonization of american indians and that the situation must be changed they can equally cripple us imperialism in its external projection by depriving it of or at least curtailing its access to crucial resources such as uranium about 60 of the north american reserves are located within native american lands and a range of other critical minerals as well the implications to us armaments production for example are obvious
2185517 lyme disease patients with neurological symptoms are usually treated with the antibiotic ceftriaxone given intravenously once a day for a month or less most patients experience full recovery
2185518 the disease presentation varies widely and may include a rash and flu like symptoms in its initial stage then musculoskeletal arthritic neurologic psychiatric and cardiac manifestations
2185519 and because you do not have insurance we cannot order the spect scan
2185520 they may have been unable to recall what they just read while reading a book they might have problems with the speed of their thinking
2185521 given the risk of considerable adverse events from prolonged antibiotic treatment
2185522 it is time to look elsewhere for an effective management strategy
2185523 we are not taking sides as to whether long term antibiotics should be provided to victims of lyme disease we are questioning whether members of that panel received benefits or fees or other kinds of compensation
2185524 it will take years to reach a solution on this if there is a breakthrough all of this argument might go away
2185525 but there is still a flat earth society so its not likely that everyone would be convinced
2185526 you should count your blessings youre just a poor person denied treatment many of us have paid into health insurance for 15 20 years and been denied the same treatment since insurance companies have devised strategies to deny the expensive treatment so were out the financial investment as well

2185532 cardiac abnormalities such as a brief fluctuating atrioventricular heart block left ventricular dysfunction or cardiomegaly may also develop cardiac involvement lasts only a few weeks but can be fatal
2185533 later many other diseases would be developed for use as weapons including rocky mountain spotted fever and various forms of encephalomyelitis
2185534 like the gruinard tests proved that a biological bomb or aerosol was perfectly feasible among the potential agents studies at camp detrick were anthrax brucellosis tularemia encephalitis and various forms of rickettsial disease
2185535 what the poem is saying grand inquisitor is that if the christian faith is combined and corrupted with the objectives of this world then the meaning of christianity will perish human reason will abandon itself to unbelief where christianity had an exalted view of mankind under the new order of things mankind will be viewed as a mere herd and behind the appearance of social love there will arise an open contempt for humanity

2185545 decade of progress welfare caseloads decrease as people shed entitlement mentality
2185546 in fact we always hear in the media and from politicians how theres so much welfare for the poor in the united states but the reality is that the united states is completely off the international spectrum in this respect we give far less than any industrialized country
2185547 the u s tax and transfer system creates a 28 5 percent reduction in the poverty rate whereas the tax and transfer systems in all other industrialized countries decrease poverty rates by between 60 and 80 percent the only exceptions being britain australia and canada whose tax and transfer programs still reduced poverty rates by approximately 50 percent
2185548 a senior government scientist pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars as a drug company consultant in exchange for human tissue samples according to congressional investigators the national institutes of healths dr trey sunderland agreed to collaborate with pfizer inc the worlds largest drug company pfizer spokeswoman kate robins said the company had a transfer agreement endorsed by the nih that permitted sunderland to send cerebrospinal fluid from research participants with alzheimers

2185555 the united states and 188 other countries signed the united nations millenium declaration a manifesto to eradicate extreme poverty hunger and disease the percentage of united states income going to poor countries remains near rock bottom 0 14 percent the test is the percentage of national income we give the poor and on that basis this country is the stingiest in the group of seven industrialized nations and the world knows it
2185556 cosette the time has come to tell you the name of your mother her name was fantine fall on your knees whenever you pronounce it she suffered a great deal and loved you very much her measure of unhappiness was as full as yours of happiness such are the distributions of god
2185557 by the experience of active love strive to love your neighbor actively and indefatigably in as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of the reality of god and of the immortality of your soul if you attain to perfect self forgetfulness in the love of your neighbor then you will believe without a doubt and no doubt can possibly enter your soul this has been tried this is certain

2185565 los angeles relatives of a 43 year old woman say hospital workers did nothing as she writhed in pain on the emergency room floor and that officers who were asked to help arrested her on a parole violation instead the woman became unresponsive as police took her away in a wheelchair and died county and state authorities are now investigating the may 8 death of edith isabel rodriguez at martin luther ling jr harbor hospital formerly called king drew where several patients have died under questionable circumstances since 2003
2185566 we cannot afford to treat indigent patients moreover we do not accept insurance they too often will not cover iv ceftriaxone for lyme disease one must have cash or credit card
2185567 so has their 1974 rusted out datsun b 210 conked out along the highway and now their reliant on public transportation
2185568 the global market for drugs for the central nervous system cns
2185569 well that just means you came in contact with the bacteria not that it is an ongoing infection
2185570 youll have to get the results through the primary care clinic
2185571 oh were not taking any more patients for six months out
2185572 opening the blood brain barrier and letting cells and factors in from the circulation is critical to the development of disease
2185573 theres plenty of evidence that if you lose blood brain barrier function even a low fraction of its function but for an extended period of time you may allow entry into the brain of molecules or cells that cause the development of pathology
2185574 a percentage of patients with lyme disease have symptoms that last months to years after treatment with
2185575 in later stages the bacteria disseminate throughout the body and may cross the
2185576 a great number of drugs may cause leukopenia as can failure of the bone marrow
2185577 in recent years a few prominent american lyme researchers have received funding for the study of organisms known as
2185578 weve now shown in all of these mice missing certain components of the immune system that as expected opening the blood brain barrier and letting cells and factors in from the circulation is critical to the development of disease
2185579 the fact that the extent of the permeability change correlates with the severity of clinical disease signs shows that this is an important element in determining how sick these animals can get
2185580 this puts an emphasis on the fact that blood brain permeability changes are an important aspect of the development of a cns inflammatory disease like eae an animal model of ms
2185581 whats astounding is that mice that wouldnt be expected to develop eae because they have major defects in their immune system are still able to develop disease
2185582 this is the first proof that there are permeability changes in all of these animals and the first hint that permeability doesnt always equal disease
2185583 these results tell us a great deal about the mechanisms that damage the blood brain barrier
2185584 all of these factors that are missing in the mice arent essential to opening the blood brain barrier

2185685 so much of the buying we saw since last august when oil was trading at 68 a barrel was predicated on a weak dollar

2185716 economically nigeria was exceptionally dependent on the world prices of its exported commodities which in turn affected the purchasing capacity of the people this fact is illustrated by the figures of customs revenue which dropped from 3 540 767 in 1927 28 to 2 109 925 in 1931 32 the governor therefore found himself with no alternative but to look to the naa native authority administrations their revenues were less affected by economic conditions for assistance in balancing the nigerian budgets by transfer to three of certain government services and works and by the reduction of their share of the proceeds of direct taxation in the northern provinces the naa materially relieved the strain on the government finances and to some extent arrested the process of drastic retrenchment then being followed by taking over on secondment a considerable portion of pwd public works department staff and by undertaking a much larger share of responsibility for the execution of public works by this method alone the government obtained material relief during a period of acute stringency
2185717 for many years following the amalgamation of the north and south the financial resources of the native administrations were generally sufficient for their needs indeed it is true to say that in the northern provinces the resources of the native administrations were regarded as available for any useful purpose without special reference to the appropriateness of the charge thus the main road from sokoto to zaria was constructed from native administration funds

2185852 elisa wall ranks among the bravest young women of the 21st century
2185853 how these practices are still tolerated in a civilised society that considers human rights and personal freedom one of its most precious commodities is beyond me
2185854 they were however cautioned by the revenue officers against the practice and promised more harsh and deterrent punishment if caught again
2185855 the inability of the efcc to arrest george in the past few years is one of the things that i crucified nuhu ribadu for and for which i supported his demotion by the police service commission
2185856 at a point when the efcc was making mass arrests of embezzlers in nigeria the issue of bode george and the npa dampened the peoples spirits as he seemed untouchable
2185857 with bode georges arrest waziri has opened a new vista for prosecution of suspected corrupt leaders and will convince the whole world that she is worth her salt
2185858 the issue should be executed to a logical conclusion through prosecution and his arrest must not be a window dressing for the efcc

2185884 approximately 80 percent live in isolated and remote rural areas most have chosen to live as far away as possible from mainstream society because bigamy is a third degree felony and they worry they will be arrested and their families separated
2185885 i personally hadnt heard a lot of good about the shapleys
2185886 i wasnt real impressed he wasnt as cute as i thought he should have been
2185887 if you dont want a child its not bad to say no
2185888 i was taught you have as many as you wanted to take care
2185889 i just said i wanted a baby he said he wanted one too
2185890 no one told you out of the blue one day you were going to get married right
2185891 i told her how she was i thought she was a neat person
2185892 be nice to her like you should i was taught that my whole life
2185893 you didnt try to initiate or start any initimate advances with your wife
2185894 but possibly im sure she would have went and lived with her mother
2185895 my boss has discovered plenty and because of this i have been shown the difference between the fake and genuine notes
2185896 my advice to traders is for them to get mercury bulbs for them to ascertain the genuineness of such notes through the invisible security features because they can be confused by the similarity of both types of notes
2185897 in every one million naira there are ten thousand naira fake notes and the cases similar everywhere but mostly at suleija deidei and zuba routes
2185898 the mass transit buses have really assist residents in fct and we do not want anything that will cripple their business
2185899 we normally identify such notes and arrest those spending them but we were surprised to see such people on the streets
2185900 yes there was a clash between our men and militants in cawthorn channel today yesterday the militants were in three boats when they sighted the naval patrol team and immediately opened fire on them after fierce gun battle the navy overpowered them and two of their boats were sunk while one was recovered and towed to our base we recovered one general purpose machine gun gpmg and several rounds of ammunition one grenade and a boat
2185901 the death penalty standing alone is not the answer to crime prevention and effective law enforcement in liberia
2185902 just like murder this law and all other death penalty laws found on the books of liberia are cruel inhumane and unjust for the republic of liberia and its citizenry forcefully and vehemently alla is articulating and asserting that because under this law an accused indicted tried and found guilty could be sentenced to death or life imprisonment it sees the need for legislative review and evaluation in liberia
2185903 since such death could be carried out by hanging for the alleged commission of the crimes of armed robbery hijacking or terrorism alla is calling on the government of liberia to rescind and repeal this law honor its international obligation as to respecting the right to life and to immediately proceed to encourage modern legislative review and reform in liberia
2185904 any law that sanctions and respects the death penalty or the killing of a fellow human being is truly distressing and unrealistic to fighting crimes in these modern days re instituting and restoring the death penalty as an answer to effective law enforcement and prevention of crimes is clearly repugnant and counterproductive
2185905 the prevention of crimes and the enforcement of law and order will be successful when the criminal justice system is wholeheartedly and financially supported by a government and its people
2185906 liberia lacks the appropriate method and mechanism to transparently investigate charge indict try and convict an accused without actual and undue interference by powerful governmental officials or wealthy litigants
2185907 in other words and in some cases he who pays the highest amount of bribes during a jury trial in liberia is more likely than not to get the verdict many poor and financially underserved citizens of liberia usually make the sitting as grand or petite jury a permanent job at times the grand jury will indict an accused without finding a presentment or a true bill
2185908 but do these points argue the cruelty and inhumanity of the introduction of the death penalty cruel or do they simply present that the reintroduction is premature and or inadequate
2185909 alla is therefore calling on the government of liberia and its operatives to put its money where its mouth is
2185910 to effectively curtail and prevent armed robbery hijacking terrorism and killings for land in liberia the government of liberia needs to re examine its 2008 to 2009 budget and lineup more money to support and strengthen law and order in liberia let law and order be prioritized by the government of liberia this is what a country returning from war to peace should and must do
2185911 but the issue that is controlling under this rape law is is the death penalty or life imprisonment appropriate and proportionate to the crime of rape as charged
2185912 in the name of human rights and social justice the rape law needs to be revisited to create its proportionate effect and appropriate impact in liberia perhaps the government of liberia could work harder and harder to rehabilitate and recreate the method to support the employment needs of its people instead of singing into law bills that are intended to execute more and more of its traumatized citizens
2185913 death penalty in liberia is a cruel punishment and a breach of the right to life
2185914 the european union expresses great concern for liberias promulgation of a law that reinstates death penalty for some crimes the decision to reinstate death penalty is an extremely disturbing sign that goes against the trend that has been observed in the last few years in africa and across the world
2185915 reasserts again its opposition to the use of death penalty in any circumstance
2185916 contributes to strengthening of human dignity and the development of human rights
2185917 cruel inhumane punishment and a breach of the right to life
2185918 amnesty international condemned the signing by liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf of a law calling for the death penalty for anyone convicted of armed robbery terrorism or hijacking offences if these crimes result in death
2185919 directly violates liberias obligations under the second optional protocol to the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr which liberia acceded to
2185920 under customary international law as reflected in article 27 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties which liberia ratified on 29 august 1985 a state may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as a justification for its failure to perform a treaty
2185921 it may be argued that ex combatants are the only group involved in armed crimes but it is the neglect of this group that gives rise to violent crimes in liberia consider the pattern the ddrr failed in 2004 elections took placed in 2005 and after that as soon as the civilian government took charge rape and armed robbery became rampant this is how some of these people live you think you can stop these poor fellows from earning their livelihood by using the only instruments available to them simply by saying you will hang them you will do well to kill 39 000 or more traumatized liberians
2185922 no the death penalty is not cruel it an antidote to cruelty perpetrated by people who have no respect for human life who are so blinded by the greed for material things to be all too ready to take life without giving the idea a second thought it is matches cruelty with the ultimate deterrent that will allow for the restoration of security to liberia remember the international community including ai and eu brands liberia fragile how else can our communities and highways be made secure so that investors will feel free to invest in this country how else will this nation be made solid and not fragile
2185923 dont we have law enforcers and law enforcement methods that are on par with those standards approved by the international community isnt the government conducting major reforms in the criminal justice system these efforts must be reinforced by a strong punitive law or they would be meaningless
2185924 so should the law be abrogated or allowed to stand as is
2185925 it could stand provided the government move immediately to reactivate the remaining rr portion of the ddrr programme
2185926 sure there is no reason why it cannot or should not stand
2185927 hey just about everyone thats out there now has a few spots
2185928 eddie is one of the best shooters in the league he adds firepower to our bench and depth to our backcourt

2185934 theyve all been very grateful theyve all been very nice
2185935 one of them told me her mom was coming to her in her dreams and she knew she wasnt at rest now that its taken care of hopefully she can have some peace
2185936 i got really choked up when she called and i actually sent her an e mail apologizing for that
2185937 i knew it all along but just for her to say it really got me upset
2185938 there are thousands and thousands of individuals in mo healthnet with really significant disease big time diabetes big time heart failure
2185939 they were scattered like the breeze they were going to hospitals emergency rooms pharmacies and not a single one of these visits was for a primary care physician it was all er admission and acute care
2185940 people have really serious diseases and they dont know anything about them its amazing
2185941 if they havent had a primary care provider then this is the first time theyve been able to call somebody and get answers
2185942 weve got some of the poorest people in state and theyve got no confidence in this program
2185943 i represent people with disabilities not working poor or anyone else but people with parkinsons ms md really serious conditions and theyre treated very much like the working poor theyre not separated out and we dont believe mo healthnet really takes their needs into consideration

2185946 this is not the end all be all its a way to get to the end not the how
2185947 to get to the how you need the professionals to look at it the city council staff the columbia police officers association and others will have a chance to get down to the weeds of what it is and how it will work but thats not why were here
2185948 when you look at boards that are abject failures its because they take too long
2185949 i think we need to tell them what a board needs to make it successful including appropriate staff to help it do its job
2185950 i dont think its our role to get that deep
2185951 you have to tell them what it takes to make this work
2185952 if you dont give them the recommendation then youre not setting it up for success
2185953 we cant tell them what staff or budget we need without knowing whats available

2185974 so i am talking about assets that are movable and immovable invisible and visible for three years their trial has not commenced when the efcc filed the cases against them
2185975 these people are enjoying the proceeds of their crime while they should be standing trial if we had this law in place they should have forfeited their assets and we would have taken it back to where it belongs
2185976 once they know that at the end of the day the properties would be forfeited to the state they would tell their children to take care of themselves because once they forfeit it there would be nothing left
2185977 government cant provide you with all you want so what you need to do is to make use of what you have
2185978 previously we worked as prosecutors and capacity building assistants to fight crime with the request by the efcc and usaid and the united nations we have been asked to draft a law on civil forfeiture the bill if passed will empower the agencies to fight crime and make civil applications to high courts for forfeiture of assets acquired through criminal means
2185979 it is not a bill that will reverse the burden of proof the burden of proof will remain with the prosecuting authorities that is the efcc or any commission that would complement what the commissions doing right now a new agency should be set up to bring civil forfeiture claims it is important for a moment to dwell on the terminology realms that is the forfeiture of property the possessor of the property will not stand the risk of conviction
2185980 we must be sure that the property is from a lawful activity and not a criminal one the law is not considering conviction based forfeiture but seizure
2185981 but the beauty of the law is that the state and individuals could bring civil cases against the suspects people must prove how they acquire their wealth it is very difficult to get criminal devising methods to cover his tracks when we have this law in place
2185982 the push for domestication came from the cat side not the human side

2186006 for these people with their childish puzzle games and their cultural feature articles were by no means innocuous children or playful phaeacians rather they dwelt anxiously among political economic and moral ferments and earthquakes waged a number of frightful wars and civil wars and their little cultural games were not just charming meaningless childishness these games sprang from their deep need to close their eyes and flee from unsolved problems and anxious forebodings of doom into an imaginary world as innocuous as possible they assiduously learned to drive automobiles to play difficult card games and lose themselves in crossword puzzles for they faced death fear pain and hunger almost without defences could no longer accept the consolations of the churches and could obtain no useful advice from reason these people who read so many articles and listened to so many lectures did not take the time and trouble to strengthen themselves against fear to combat the dread of death within themselves they moved spasmodically on through life and had no belief in a tomorrow

2186129 both of these first amendment cases reflect the clear right wing trend of the roberts court unmistakably both are clearly wrong
2186130 although this case began with a silly nonsensical banner it ends with the court inventing out of whole cloth a special first amendment rule permitting the censorship of any student speech that mentions drugs
2186131 i am gratified that the supreme court has upheld the application of our common sense policies
2186132 the courts ruling imposes new restrictions on student speech rights and creates a drug exception to the first amendment

2186159 and argue not with the people of the scripture unless it be in a way that is better with good words and in good manner we believe in that which has been revealed to you our god and your god is one

2186174 kill the mushrikeen polytheists christians and non muslims wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush
2186175 for the unbelievers non muslims are open enemies to you
2186176 seize them and slay them wherever you find them and in any case take no friends or helpers from their ranks
2186177 if anyone desires a religion other than islam it will never be accepted of him

2186203 i have worked for some time on the designs for a new range of microphones the concepts of which are actually already being implemented in our own rupert neve designs 5088 console namely utilizing discrete single sided circuits and my custom designed transformers
2186204 this new approach to analogue sound processing needs extreme care in its manufacture and meticulous alignment of the embedded discrete opamps and the delicate microphone elements
2186205 this association with siwei zou and se will provide an ideal partnership in terms of their masterly and enthusiastic commitment to innovation and quality that have also been my own hallmarks for more than 50 years
2186206 i have for many years admired the work of mr neve and now that we have a chance to work together i am able to realise a quality level in microphone technology that no other manufacturer to date has managed to achieve the excellence we have worked so hard to achieve in production design and capsule technology at se coupled with the best transformers this product area has ever seen plus new cutting edge circuit board design which from early tests are already proving to surpass anything i have ever heard before means we are now able to produce high end mics at a fraction of the cost of other high end brand models but which have a sound and performance quality the likes of which this market has never seen before this is a truly exciting time for se and me personally
2186207 we are extremely pleased to be working so closely with se electronics rupert has been studying the mic market for some years with the intention of working on a project like this after putting a number of big brand names and countless mics through rigorous testing and looking at the manufacturing techniques build quality and work ethic of these companies it quickly became clear that the partnership with se would be extremely interesting from both a design standpoint and for the market
2186208 where most manufacturers we looked into seem to be cutting corners in manufacturing packaging etc or subcontracting to oem to save money and blindly copy what has been done before se have consistently shown us a complete commitment to pushing the design envelope with hand crafted quality in all their products and continual efforts to improve every detail possible in their product ses ethos is less about making as much profit as possible and more about making the best product they can and frankly that is precisely what mr neve is all about
2186209 its a huge honor for us that rupert even considered us among the big players as a company he might like to work with in the end there was no way we could ever compete with the kind of money that a large corporation could throw around to secure a deal so its a testament to mr neves principles and dedication to his art that he chose to work with the company that he thought would build the best product plain and simple
2186210 we are all so excited about where this collaboration will take us and focused now on getting the first three products to market by summer 2008 and then well youll see
2186211 the akg c 414 has been successful for more than 30 years due to continuous improvement of technical specifications useful features and ease of use the evolution of the c 414 has been informed by feedback from recording studios broadcast stations and live sound engineers
2186212 our new c 214 was designed as a budget friendly alternative to the leading edge c 414 family because the c214 uses the same one inch diaphragm as the c414 the essence of that heralded c 414 sound has been captured in this newest model

2186389 hoy la democracia persigue un objetivo fundamental la liberaci n del hombre de todas las formas de opresi n es la liberaci n del hombre de todas las coacciones autoritarias
2186390 el hombre es soberano de sus ideas all el brazo opresor de ning n tirano ha llegado
2186391 en un estado autoritario donde la libertad de expresi n y el acceso a las fuentes de informaci n son obstaculizadas y hostigadas y finalmente anuladas con el objeto de evitar el desacuerdo y la cr tica a los gobernantes y as obtener obediencia y sometimiento de las personas

2186396 las acciones privadas de los hombres que de ning n modo ofendan al orden y a la moral p blica ni perjudiquen a un tercero est n s lo reservadas a dios y exentas de la autoridad de los magistrados
2186397 bas ndonos en el concepto amplio de libertad interpretando la ley suprema en funci n din mica y teniendo en cuenta que nuestro constituyente no conoc a las formas y medios de expresi n actuales llegamos a la conclusi n que la constituci n esta conclusi n encuentra su fundamento jur dico en el art culo 13 del pacto de san jos de costa rica que se encuentra comprendido en el conjunto de tratados internacionales con jerarqu a constitucional que establece
2186398 el control veto u obstaculizaci n del pensamiento producido con anterioridad de su emisi n en p blico
2186399 la prohibici n de censura previa no significa que el derecho a la expresi n p blica de las ideas sea absoluto como afirman algunos periodistas e incluso cierta doctrina
2186400 la censura previa est prohibida por la constituci n como polic a preventiva pero cabe la polic a preventiva a posteriori de los delitos o infracciones cometidos por la prensa
2186401 el ejercicio del derecho previsto en el inciso precedente no puede estar sujeto a previa censura sino a responsabilidades ulteriores
2186402 no se puede invocar el derecho a expresar p blicamente las ideas si con l se lesionan o se ponen en peligro cierto derechos tales como el que protege la vida se pretende instigar la comisi n de un delito o se efect a su apolog a en circunstancias como stas la sociedad tiene derecho a protegerse castigando el ejercicio abusivo de la libertad de expresi n

2186404 el congreso federal tiene competencia para dictar leyes de prensa para todo el pa s a condici n de que lo haga con razonabilidad sin restricciones arbitrarias
2186405 consideramos que esto no aporta ni tiene ning n valor period stico para el televidente sino que suma y favorece el exhibicionismo y la morbosidad de la que hacen uso la mayor a de los programas adem s de manifestar el mal tratamiento de la informaci n

2186414 hay quien percibe y hay quien no el car cter intolerable de un ser humano reducido a la condici n de piltrafa vegetativa en contra de su voluntad el caso es que muchos pensamos que la vida no es un valor absoluto que la vida debe ligarse con calidad de vida y que cuando esta calidad se degrada m s all de ciertos l mites uno tiene derecho a dimitir este derecho a dimitir el derecho a una muerte digna a una muerte sin dolor y sin angustia se inscribe en el contexto de una sociedad secularizada y de un estado laico donde ya nadie cree que el sufrimiento innecesario tenga ning n sentido y donde el respeto a la libre voluntad del enfermo es primordial
2186415 nadie puede ser obligado justificadamente a realizar o no realizar determinados actos porque eso fuera mejor para l porque le har a feliz porque en opini n de los dem s hacerlo ser a m s acertado o m s justo la nica parte de la conducta de cada uno por la que l es responsable ante la sociedad es la que se refiere a los dem s en la parte que le concierne meramente a l su independencia es de derecho absoluta sobre s mismo sobre su propio cuerpo y esp ritu el individuo es soberano

2186418 cita las tres encuestas realizadas all de las que la ltima registra en 2001 unos 900 casos de eutanasia sin petici n expresa de los pacientes cerca de un cuarto del total tambi n en holanda el informe oficial m s reciente muestra que la despenalizaci n no ha servido para que la eutanasia se practique a la luz del d a y en conformidad con la ley solo se comunican a las autoridades el 54 del total de casos y menos del 1 de aquellos en que no hubo petici n expresa del paciente adem s el a o pasado se supo que se est aplicando la eutanasia a ni os peque os aunque la ley la permite solo para pacientes mayores de 12 a os en b lgica ocurre algo similar en m s de dos tercios de los casos los enfermos no hab an solicitado la eutanasia
2186419 ser reprimido con prisi n de 1 a 4 a os el que instigare a otro al suicidio o le ayudare a cometerlo si el suicidio se hubiese tentado o consumado
2186420 el c digo argentino no contiene ninguna norma relativa a la eutanasia pero la generalidad de los autores admiten que pueda constituir una circunstancia atenuante de la responsabilidad criminal por cuanto cabe valorarla en sentido similar a la atenuante de la emoci n tambi n es generalizada la opini n en el sentido de que la realidad del m vil ha de ser considerada con muy especial cuidado porque a veces se da el caso de que el autor que cree estar realizando el acto de piedad hacia la v ctima lo que en el fondo realiza aunque sea inconcientemente es un acto de piedad hacia s mismo derivado del cansancio y de la angustia que le ocasiona el cuidado del enfermo y la presencia permanente de su sufrimiento
2186421 la ayuda al suicidio representa una forma de participaci n material punible que puede consistir en una cooperaci n o auxilio y ser tambi n principal o accesoria siempre que el tercero no sea autor o coautor en la muerte que otro se ha dado supuestos en los cuales se tratar a de un homicidio o de una participaci n en l
2186422 en ning n caso el m dico est autorizado a abreviar o suprimir la vida de un paciente mediante acciones u omisiones orientadas directamente a ese fin la eutanasia por omisi n configura una falta grav sima a la tica m dica y a las normas legales debe permitirse la muerte del enfermo pero nunca provoc rsela

2186635 hola mundo un cordial saludo de alberto thirion de durango
2186636 is this thing on or is that just feedback coming from your stupidity
2186637 kau orang baru ya pasal kau masuk ke sini terjerat pasal berapa
2186638 ooh maaf saya tidak tahu semuanya diurus oleh pengacara saya
2186639 kok bisa sewa pengacara ongkos sewa pengacara kan mahal kau pasti orang kaya kalau bukan orang kaya tidak mungkin kau bilang semuanya diurus pengacara memangnya kau kena kasus apa
2186640 ceritanya panjang saya dituduh melakukan penipuan dan manipulasi data keuangan perusahaan padahal saya melakukannya karena ditekan oleh atasan saya saya tidak tahu untuk apa dia memerintahkan saya begitu sebenarnya saya sudah sering melakukannya hanya saja kali ini para pemegang saham mau mengecek data data tersebut secara langsung perusahaan saya mau melepas sebagian sahamnya ke pasar bursa saat itulah ketahuan kalau banyak data yang tidak sesuai dengan kenyataan yang mereka ketahui hanyalah saya yang bertugas untuk menyusun data data sejak dulu saya jadi serba salah singkatnya begitu saya tidak tahu itu pasal berapa pengacara yang menangani kasus saya pun tidak saya ketahui asalnya dia tiba tiba saja datang menawarkan bantuan untuk membela saya tanpa meminta sepeser uang pun tapi ia meminta syarat saya harus mempercayainya kemudian saya ketahui kalau dia dari lembaga lembaga bantuan hukum khusus untuk kasus kasus seperti yang menimpa saya ini
2186641 lalu atasan yang memerintahkan kau untuk membuat data palsu itu ke mana
2186642 saya tidak tahu dia melarikan diri pembelaan yang menyebutkan bahwa saya ditekan untuk membuat data palsu itu tidak bisa diterima oleh majelis hakim karena tidak ada saksi lain yang membenarkan pernyataan saya ketika vonis jatuh atasan saya belum ditemukan maka saya harus menjalani hukuman kalau anda sendiri maaf kalau saya lancang menanyakannya
2186643 anda tidak perlu menceritakannya ke saya kalau anda tidak mau atau membuat anda teringat pada sesuatu yang membuat anda bersedih
2186644 pertama jangan sebut saya dengan kata ganti orang kedua tunggal anda pakai saja kata lainnya nama saya samsul kalau itu bisa memudahkanmu kedua saya sudah lama hampir dua minggu tidak mendapat teman satu sel teman satu sel saya yang lalu sudah keluar saya pikir saya bisa menceritakannya padamu apa saya bisa minta rokokmu lagi sedap sekali rasanya bisa merokok saat seperti ini
2186645 dulu saya adalah pembuat tato banyak orang yang datang pada saya untuk dibuatkan tato saya sangat ahli melakukannya kata orang tato buatan saya sangat indah untuk mendukung pernyataan orang orang tersebut dan melancarkan usaha saya mesti menghias tubuh saya dengan tato juga saya memang menyukainya bagi saya tato seperti bagian hidup yang telah ada semenjak saya lahir
2186646 malam itu usai menato tubuhnya di tempat saya dia ditemukan mati dengan luka tusukan
2186647 apakah pengadilan juga melihat tato sebagai bukti terjadinya pembunuhan saya pikir tidak mana ada pengadilan yang menggunakan tato sebagai bukti yang memberatkan tertuduh kecuali kematiannya disebabkan oleh alat alat pembuat tato yang ada di tempatmu
2186648 kau ini seperti tidak tahu saja keputusan bersalah atau tidak ditentukan oleh majelis hakim bagaimanapun juga mereka tetap manusia sama seperti kita mereka juga bisa terpengaruh atau dipengaruhi ketika semua bukti mengarah padaku mereka mungkin masih mempertimbangkannya tapi kalau di kepala mereka sudah berisi bermacam macam gambaran tentang figur kriminal bukankah hal itu bisa mengurangi pertimbangan atau setidaknya ada pengaruhnya dalam pengambilan keputusan pengambilan keputusan mau tidak mau selain menyertakan argumentasi argumentasi yang masuk di akal juga dipengaruhi oleh apa yang ada di dalam kepala kita meskipun kadang kita tidak menyadarinya
2186649 aku khawatir kau sudah lupa rasanya sudah cukuplah malu yang menghias mukaku ini tak perlu lagi ditambah dengan menegor orang yang lupa atau pura pura lupa
2186650 hei aku meninggalkan salemba ketika kau masih banyak brewok di sekujur wajahmu bagaimana aku bisa ingat betul tampangmu yang sekarang dengan tampangmu dua tahun yang lalu
2186651 sebenarnya aku tidak mengenalimu tapi siapa yang tidak kenal dengan tato ular beludak yang melingkari pergelangan tangan kiri seseorang
2186652 ooh tidak banyak kalau di tangan kanannya ada tato bergambar bunga mawar melingkari lengannya itu pasti kau si brewok samsul
2186653 kau beruntung betul mendapatkan orang yang berusaha membelamu meskipun kau telah ada di dalam penjara tanpa mengeluarkan dana sepeserpun lagi
2186654 ya memang masa tahananku tinggal satu tahun tiga bulan lagi perjalanan yang panjang anehnya aku merasa hidup di sini di dalam penjara dulu waktu sidang pengadilanku mendengar seluruh dakwaan yang ditujukan kepadaku aku merasa sudah mati tak ada sedikit pun bukti atau kesaksian yang bisa membantuku saat itu aku berpikir tentang detik detik kematianku
2186655 aku percaya kau tidak bersalah kalau pun ada kesalahan untukmu itu adalah karena kau begitu mencintai keindahan yang ada di balik tato itu pun sebenarnya bukan suatu kejahatan aku mau mengakui bahwa semua tatomu indah sul
2186656 bukan tatomu tapi pikiran orang yang terbentuk tentang tato bagimu tato itu adalah keindahan tapi bagi sebagian orang lain tato itu melambangkan orang yang suka melawan kaidah kaidah dan nilai nilai yang berkembang di masyarakat pertama melihatmu saja aku ngeri di sekujur tubuhmu dipenuhi oleh tato tapi lama kelamaan aku menjadi terbiasa malahan sekarang aku mengaguminya
2186657 tapi aku juga adalah orang lain bagimu aku hanya teman satu sel
2186658 kalau hanya cap bekas narapidana aku masih bisa menerimanya tapi seluruh tato ini akan menghalangiku untuk kembali ke masyarakat
2186659 kalau ketika kau bebas nanti masyarakat tidak mau menerima kehadiranmu kau bisa menghubungiku kita bisa ketemu lagi nanti kalau aku bisa diterima kembali di perusahaanku aku bisa mempromosikanmu untuk bekerja di sana entah sebagai apa kalau tidak bisa kita bisa usaha bersama aku punya sedikit tabungan untuk modal usaha

2186661 bagaimana itu dapat terjadi bukankah saya selalu sepenuh hati membuat korwar bagi mereka yang telah wafat
2186662 mungkin ada yang tidak puas sehingga dia tidak dapat menerima pujaan dari yang ditinggalkannya mungkin dia ditinggalkan karena bagi mereka yang ditinggalkan korwar pujaannya tidak indah tidak menampilkan siapa dirinya sehingga hanya ditaruh di dapur atau di lumbung saja
2186663 bagaimana jika mereka yang ditinggalkan oleh almarhum tidak pernah mengingatnya bukankah itu juga mungkin terjadi
2186664 itu bisa saja terjadi dan kalau memang itu yang terjadi dia meminta engkau untuk mengingatkan mereka yang ditinggalkan olehnya
2186665 betul tetapi ibu tidak pernah mengatakan bahwa kakekku masih hidup katanya dia telah lama wafat itu sebabnya aku membuat korwar untuk mengenang kakekku mustahil aku membuat korwar untuk orang yang masih hidup
2186666 aku mengucapkan terima kasih untuk baktimu itu tetapi aku hanya sekedar mampir aku mau berbincang sebentar denganmu
2186667 sia sia mengapa aku akan sia sia aku tidak melakukan hal yang salah
2186668 dengarlah cucuku dulu kofarkin korwar adalah sesuatu yang amat bernilai engkau akan dihargai oleh warga kampung tetapi sekarang kau melakukan pekerjaan yang sia sia aku tidak mau engkau menyia nyiakan hidupmu untuk sesuatu yang telah ditinggalkan oleh warga kampung
2186669 tetapi itu adalah darah dagingku tempatku mengabdi pada hidup dan wargaku
2186670 terserah padamu cucuku aku sudah mengingatkanmu tapi pikirkanlah itu terlebih dahulu

2186684 in order to be a good speaker you must first be a good listener
2186685 the greatest discovery of my generation is that man can alter his life simply by altering his attitude of mind
2186686 it is a difficult day for me to come here at emirates stadium and talk about this but i want to come here explain why to the fans i want to be certain of where the club was going and reassured in a way i wasnt and i have chosen to go
2186687 it was a long one but nobody knew what was happening to be honest we were hearing some stuff in the press about what happened and what did not happen so you have to make your own mind up it was the most difficult decision of my life
2186688 beating the record of wrighty putting it at 226 playing for arsenal loving the club it was and will remain the most difficult decision of my life i will always love the club
2186689 i dont know if i will play eight years more or where the future is so yes
2186690 i looked the schedule and already know when we i mean you are playing against tottenham i did it as a reflex when fixtures came out i looked for tottenham and i know it is pretty early on when they play i will be watching and trying to be the first to know the result even though i know the fans will beat me it is really special coming here to emirates stadium to talk about it i will always have arsenal in my blood i know some people will never accept the decision i just want to say to the fans that i always gave 100 per cent even the last year when i was injured i tried to perform it was not the 30 goals you were used to but it was 17 games in the league and scored 10 so that was not a bad ratio it was all about the heart and the commitment to win for arsenal i always always always always gave 100 per cent
2186691 they were all amazing for me i think i scored some good goals at highbury and away but the one that stands out was my second against liverpool when we went unbeaten in the league i never heard highbury going crazy like that i thought the place was going to collapse and you could tell by my celebration that it was the right time and place to score that goal i went a bit mental the place was just too loud scoring goals for arsenal gave me goosebumps but that was a stand out goal and kept us in the title race we stayed there until the end
2186692 i would say winning the league unbeaten but one that would top that is my last goal at highbury when i kissed the ground it was a special moment for me but as well this particular day is one of the saddest of my career leaving highbury i cant say it was the best moment but it was a particular moment i am still shaking talking about it now
2186693 difficult to say some people came here and did not win anything but that does not mean they were not great players if i go with the team that stayed unbeaten then that means i have to leave out david seaman and a load of other players but in terms of the results then staying unbeaten is something rather amazing but then with the guys before we had won the double every time i wore an arsenal shirt it was just amazing when i stepped on that pitch even where i was not performing well whoever was playing with me at the time was the right guy for me
2186694 i would say when we lost the champions league final against barcelona in paris
2186695 but as well i would say the first time i arrived here and people were giving me stick the fans were always behind me and cool with me i could go through whole eight years it was crazy i have had a really special relationship with them
2186696 i would like to think that when people talk about arsenal they see the boss has brought the arsenal touch and the arsenal way and im truly proud of being one of those guys to have helped play the way we have been
2186697 arsenal is a club that is now well known throughout europe and thats all down to the boss also the fans they are never in trouble with fighting or disrespectful to other fans the arsenal fans have always made us proud
2186698 from a personal point of view at arsenal i have really become a man this is thanks to the boss thanks to all the players thanks to all the facilities at the club and as i said before thanks to all the people who made my life easier here they have made me a man
2186699 the set up and the facilities are far too good and we still have a lot of the main people who are staying
2186700 when patrick left everyone was devastated including me and then after that a little guy came around called cesc fabregas and although i didnt agree with it everyone started saying who needs patrick vieira for me the guys we have here are amazing but you always need patrick vieira
2186701 i dont believe what everybody is saying about the club collapsing having a lack of players and everyone leaving
2186702 as i said to you i will now become now an arsenal fan and will be looking at every result and im sure the team will be successful
2186703 to be honest i have a great relationship with the boss ive told you the reasons why i wanted to go and i told him exactly the same reasons thats how it is i talked to the boss about private stuff and non private stuff a bit of everything
2186704 but as i said to you today is a very sad day for me whatever people are going to talk or read or see into it it is a very sad for me
2186705 one thing that i forgot to say earlier was about the pride to play for the shirt and the team
2186706 although i have had disagreements with the press over here they have been tremendous to me keeping me on my toes
2186707 getting a standing ovation away from home with arsenal is something i will never forget because you know a lot of people are really appreciating what you are doing as a team and its outstanding
2186708 as i have said before i just want to thank everyone at the club the girls who work at the training ground the girls who wash the kits the masseurs the staff at the club the staff at the stadium the staff who work on the pitch at the stadium the staff who work on the pitches at the training ground the press office the coach driver everybody
2186709 also to all the teams i have played against here all the battles i have had against the players here some of the fans away the press and the refs its been a great time
2186710 its important to me to come to the club today and say something properly because the fans have given me so much and i hope i gave a lot back to them i want to keep my box here and i want to come back and watch some games if they let me in but its been a very weird day
2186711 i dont regret what i do playing for arsenal was an honour for me and i will say that until the day i die when patrick vieira left the team had to move on and we came close to winning the champions league but this type of guy we were already missing
2186712 not having ars ne around anymore and everybody at the club will be missing for me
2186713 there is something special here at arsenal too i left arsenal to go to barcelona because no disrespect to any other team but there are only two teams in the world who play football the way i like it that is the way the people here like it the arsenal way that is how we play football here and we play football there if i can say that is one of the is the main reasons for barcelona the football they play is attractive to watch
2186714 well i would to say you have been tremendous for me i really do appreciate it
2186715 arsenal will be in my blood aswell as my heart i will always always always remember you guys i said i was going to be a gunner for life and i did not lie because when you are a gunner you will always be a gunner the club is in my heart and will remain in my heart forever

2186738 there is a big demand for what i do because artists can only usually get so far with out the help of an experienced producer one who can record arrange and write in order to get it to the next level
2186739 the trend should be to forget the contacts and focus more on producing the music bands artists think that a lawyer should shop the music and the producer should make the music i believe that a band will shop itself if the material and live show is the best it can be

2186773 i would be wasting my time doing either of those
2186774 the paper would never use them they are just not interested
2186775 you were a picture editor at the independent what do you think of these
2186776 what we want are independent style pictures something imaginative something good something we can use right across the top of the page with impact

2186784 its amazing to see how much people inside the company have copies and drafts of this book
2186785 we did it by following the previous words of the great pope benedict xvi when he still was cardinal joseph ratzinger
2186786 he explained why harry potter brings the youngs sic of our earth to the neo paganism faith
2186787 i think its completely a hoax i would rarely trust some odd claim like that from someone on full disclosure
2186788 if the person was smart and they actually got that they wouldve published a few paragraphs or a chapter
2186789 you just cant know its sort of an unauthenticatable premise it reminds me of what other media producers have done when they will record two or three possible endings and one of them airs
2186790 so did it really happen personally i dont want to know because i want to read the book
2186791 hi folks sensational sean azzopardi here this issue of necessary monsters is a special caption preview edition what does that mean you ask well it means theres only 25 of them in existence and one day theyll be worth a bazillion dollars due to their rarity it also means we didnt quite finish this issue before caption ho ho ho silly us if youd like to get your hands on those extra pages they can be yours within a few short weeks just bring this issue along with you to low energy day in camden lock on the 31st august and you can get an official copy of necessary monsters 2 for half price or if you cant make it to london send us a photo of yourself holding this preview edition and well pop one in the post to you because were just lovely like that speculative estimate possibly also a lie
2186792 its like taking one guy off the corner selling drugs theres just someone on the next corner
2186793 theres a large number of computers not running anti virus software that is not up to date
2186794 the fbi is clearly concerned about the number of computers in the united states that are being operated remotely without the knowledge of the computers owners how the fbi proposes to notify infected users that their computer is compromised is not clear
2186795 what is clear is that this is an opportunity for computer owners to take a moment to run a scan of their computer to determine whether malware is present
2186796 the majority of victims are not even aware that their computer has been compromised or their personal information exploited
2186797 an attacker gains control by infecting the computer with a virus or other malicious code and the computer continues to operate normally citizens can protect themselves from botnets and the associated schemes by practicing strong computer habits to reduce the risk that you computer will be compromised
2186798 i am disappointed and concerned with the method in which the ontario government has taken to reach our young people with this issue
2186799 i personally do not have a problem with the flick off logo i actually think it is a piece of ingenious marketing
2186800 it is not what goes into a man that makes him unclean but what comes out of a man for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
2186801 what this person alludes to is only partially true and is mostly lies
2186802 the son can do nothing without the father but what he sees the father doing that is what he does

2186812 the judgement and the stigmatisation were quite good at but the real question is how do we hold on to biblical principles while reaching out in love to others

2186814 we will not deny what scripture says about human relationships but we will lead with an open embrace
2186815 in the philosophy of the unity of everything the distinction between good and evil is necessarily relativized we can find some important clarifications of this question in the thinking of guardini in his philosophy of opposition guardini thought out the basic distinction between opposition and contradiction which is what it finally comes down to here oppositions are complementary they constitute the richness of reality in his most important philosophical work he made opposition the central principle of the way he looked at reality in which he saw in the many tensions of life the wealth of existence oppositions refer us to one another each needs the other and only between them do they produce the harmony of the whole but contradiction breaks out of this harmony and destroys it evil is not even as hegel thought and as goethe tries to show us in faust one side of the whole and thus necessary to us but is the destruction of being it is in fact unable to say of itself as does fausts mephistopheles i am a part of that power which always seek evil and always works good good would then have the need of evil and evil would not really be evil at all but would just be a necessary part of the worlds dialectical process the sacrifice of countless thousands of victims by communism was justified with this philosophy building upon the dialectic of hegel which marx then turned into a political system no evil is not a part of the dialectic of being rather it attacks it at its very roots
2186816 the choice between a personal god or the mysticism of identity is most certainly not a merely theoretical one from the inmost depth of the question of being it reaches out into practical living

2186895 she has been rotting at my place for the last couple of weeks with no potential customers
2186896 the market is down these days otherwise she is worth at least 50 000 rupees
2186897 in lahore we can scarcely find enough business but if we work only four weekends a month in karachi it fetches us twice the amount we would normally earn despite working day and night
2186898 many of these girls are minors who are forced into the sex trade from surrounding countries the majority of them end up in karachi
2186899 with the closure of brothels to the public the prostitutes whose profession is often passed from generation to generation dispersed to the cities residential areas to earn their livelihoods with the passage of time girls from impoverished families also came to join them
2186900 i dont have to have sex with him which is normal at other places he treats me like a brother
2186901 the ones who dont know dancing hardly get any tips but if we do our clients when they get drunk shower us with all the money they have in their wallets
2186902 when the girl is young she is like a cheque that one can cash even on sundays but when she begins to age she is akin to rotten fish it becomes hard for her to meet even her monthly expenses those with dancing skills however have some bonus years in which to attract customers in this marketplace
2186903 its all a game of contacts the more connected you are the better the business
2186904 the day i realised i had enough contacts i started my own business
2186905 the police lost 80 per cent of the amount they used to extract from us through blackmail and extortion
2186906 once our whereabouts are known we can easily be trapped by the police and they create lot of problems for us including demanding free services from these girls as well as regular
2186907 its very difficult to track them down because they live for barely six months at any one place before shifting on to another
2186908 pimps have no problem dropping girls off at your place but they avoid obliging people without references for fear that they may be walking into a police trap
2186909 once when i went on call there were six young men drinking alcohol in the drawing room
2186910 how they sleep with people of different age groups all with different temperaments the fat and the slim the educated and the uneducated some of them violent others nice the black wheatish and the whitish the experienced and the inexperienced
2186911 its like a mercenary killer or a thief who finds it difficult to commit the crime in the beginning but becomes hardened after the second and third times
2186912 initially the work used to really upset me but when i accepted the bitter reality that i had to do this i just tuned my mind accordingly
2186913 i normally pay these girls extra money and request them to pretend as though they have an emotional connection with me i cannot enjoy sex until then
2186914 if you have a girlfriend you spend a lot of money taking her out for meals or for shopping she will start demanding that you marry her and if you refuse she is quite liable to blackmail you claiming pregnancy or other such shenanigans
2186915 in sleeping with call girls one runs the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as hiv hepatitis b and c among others but when youre hiring a girl solely for yourself there is less risk of getting infected
2186916 i have been doing this for over a decade and have so far had no difficulty in picking up women this way
2186917 i went there for the first time with a friend of mine who was a frequent client and as im known to them now i have no problem going there any time
2186918 most of them let you fondle their bodies in order to make tips at the end of the job
2186919 during their sojourn which lasted over two weeks most of them were supplied with a new girl and a bottle of scotch every day
2186920 usually the men are dissuaded by pressure from family and friends who advise them against it on the grounds that marrying such a girl would be a stain on their family honour
2186921 in the good days we were so busy we barely had time to return or at times even answer our clients calls but now we often make calls to them ourselves to offer our services its a hardly a break even situation these days
2186922 every man who comes asks for younger and younger girls the demand for them means that the young ones fetch more money and get more clients per day
2186923 thinking outside the box is when i am playing golf like say i hit my tee shot into the trees i am one of the few people who can come up with an idea to get out of the trees without changing my normal swing and still allow me to hit the green
2186924 there is no shot at the green well i though well what about this gap between two trees and the hole in the trees above well i tried it and did it and made birdie compared to the other kids bogey
2186925 i dont need to use notes i never have its just part of my makeup

2186927 so exactly whats the difference between a direct object and and indirect object
2186928 you didnt know something until you could clearly say it ot loud
2186929 aha quite often but never from something i did not understand or know
2186930 aha moment but recite and recite again does work tremendously because it takes a while for your mind decodes and stores in your brain

2186934 my husband died after a long suffering persistent coughing recurrent fever chronic diarrhoea skin rashes loss of weight lack of appetite and night sweating tortured him during seven months of his illness
2186935 the problem is that my husband believed that anyone with tb is hiv positive as far as he was concerned it was a waste of time for a person suspected to be hiv positive to go for treatment as the aids causing virus has no cure
2186936 i was diagnosed tb smear positive but hiv negative even after those results i failed to convince my husband to go the hospital
2186937 i am a healthy person now but i still weep for my deceased husband who died after refusing to go for tb treatment if he had accepted to go for tb treatment he would have been cured and would have been alive
2186938 hiv aids has therefore complicated the fight against tb because it has increased tb cases and death rate hiv aids has also increased the demand of resources in terms of human financial and logistic in terms of coping up with this scourge
2186939 by using dots in malawi there is evidence that the tb cases have not been increasing in the last three years and in some districts they are actually on the decline
2186940 tb is too often a death sentence for people with aids we cant fight aids unless we do much more fight tb as well
2186941 we are tackling tb and aids using a collaborative approach this entails that patients who present with hiv as a health problem are also screened for tb and patients who present with tb are also screened with hiv
2186942 the tb patient by criteria is eligible for the provision of arvs therefore the tb patient receives arvs
2186943 a low socioeconomic status among the population coupled with a poor healthcare system in general is the likely explanation for high hiv mortality rates due to tb
2186944 new tb infection is not just the product of poverty but also creates poverty
2186945 government is committed to fighting tb hiv aids and lack of nutrition
2186946 it is a policy that tb patients who are on treatment get fortified food such as likuni phala
2186947 the war on tb will easily be won once many people are sensitized and have realized that tb is curable regardless of ones hiv sero status
2186948 everything is in constant motion of building and reduction is a stabilizer that makes firm the foundations of that which was made to stand

2186954 our most recent analysis supports earlier findings that patients visiting cam complimentary and alternative medicine orientated primary care physicians pcp primarily chiropractors experienced fewer hospitalizations underwent fewer surgeries and used considerably fewer pharmaceuticals than hmo patients who received traditional medical care
2186955 perhaps the most striking finding of our study is that even activity at the 4 kcal kg per week level approximately 72 min wk was associated with a significant improvement in fitness compared with women in the non exercise control group
2186956 data presented in our study show that even 72 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week accumulated over about 3 days has a significant effect on fitness in previously sedentary postmenopausal women this information can be used to support future recommendations and should be encouraging to sedentary adults who find it difficult to find the time for 150 minutes of activity per week let alone 60 minutes per day

2186976 it is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied and a highly endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for as the world is constituted is imperfect but he can learn to bear its imperfections if they are at all bearable and they will not make him envy the being who is indeed unconscious of the imperfections but only because he feels not at all the good which those imperfections qualify it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied better to be socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied and if the fool or the pig are a different opinion it is because they only know their own side of the question the other party to the comparison knows both sides

2186996 specifically those who are speaking out against nymphet seem to be disturbed by the relationship between two characters in the story namely an elementary school student and her adult teacher
2186997 have an open dialogue with the large book chains and other vendors
2186998 its not appropriate for seven seas to publish nymphet and that it would cancel its release of the manga
2186999 my primary reason for canceling nymphet is due to my recent realization that later volumes in the series can not be considered appropriate for the us market by any reasonable standard
2187000 the vendors began dropping their orders left and right so their opinion on this matter became pretty clear cut
2187001 what i heard about issues in volume 2 and later made me realize the differences in the cultures between the countries

2187242 the teen work crisis isnt just depriving kids of pocket money its hurting society because teenagers are not learning how to work some experts say
2187243 a lot of my clients express frustration that theyre more babysitters than employers
2187244 these workers lack a work ethic they dont know how to be a good employee they havent had jobs and learned to be accountable
2187245 the vast majority of teenagers and younger adults dont wake up one day and understand what it is to be an employee to learn to be counted on to be accountable to do well or not the workers were not hiring will come into the work force whether youre hiring them at 16 or 30
2187246 i try to convince my clients to give a performance evaluation at the end to show where the teens could develop where they performed well if they were good provide a financial incentive next year a premium

2187257 when the fortunes of war were against us the same faithful army of tennessee soldiers remained true to their flag and with rare exceptions followed it in retreat as they had borne it in advance
2187258 whilst i failed utterly to bring on battle at spring hill
2187259 looking worn and tired but with kindly words for all said to the soldiers boys this is all my fault
2187260 the attack at franklin which entailed so great a sacrifice of life had become a necessity as imperative as that which impelled gen lee to order the assault at gaines mill when our troops charged across an open space a distance of one mile under a most galling fire of musketry and artillery against an enemy heavily entrenched the heroes in that action fought not more gallantly than the soldiers of the army of tennessee upon the fields of franklin
2187261 how plainly he spoke out these dreadful words my defeat and discomfiture my army is destroyed my losses he said he had nobody to blame but himself
2187262 the best move of my career as a soldier i was thus destined to behold come to naught the discovery that the army after a forward march of one hundred and eighty miles was still seemingly unwilling to accept battle unless under the protection of breastworks caused me to experience grave concern in my inmost heart i questioned whether or not i would ever succeed in eradicating this evil
2187263 i have for the past year felt that the corps of this army were too large for one commander nothing prevented my proposing to you to reduce their size and increase their number but my inability to recommend commanders each corps contains when in fighting condition about 30 000 men these are more than one man can properly handle and keep under his eye in battle in the country that we have to operate in they are always beyond the range of his vision and frequently beyond his reach the loss of jackson from command of one half the army seems to me a good opportunity to remedy this evil
2187264 the subject of the efficiency of the army is one of paramount importance and the letter of the secretary of war herewith submitted has been elicited by correspondence with the generals of our armies in the field whose practical experience of the evils resulting from the defects in our present system entitles their opinion to great weight
2187265 and i will here inquire in vindication of its fair name if any intelligent man of that army supposes for one moment that these same troops one year previous would even without orders to attack have allowed the enemy to pass them at rocky faced ridge as he did at spring hill
2187266 the operations which occurred while the troops were in the entrenchments in front of richmond and petersburg were not marked by the boldness and decision which formerly characterized them except in particular instances they were feeble and a want of confidence seemed to possess officers and men
2187267 i am left a commander without an army a general without troops you have made your choice it was unwise and unpatriotic but it is final
2187268 such a loss by an army of almost a hundred thousand men would have been utterly insignificant too trifling to discourage much less defeat brave soldiers
2187269 i perceived that the enemy and our own officers had settled down to the conviction that i would not assault fortified lines all looked to me to outflank an army to be efficient must not settle down to a single mode of offense but must be prepared to execute any plan which promises success i wanted therefore for the moral effect to make a successful assault against the enemy behind his breast works and resolved to attempt it at that point where success would give the greatest fruits of victory
2187270 at times assaults he refers to johnstons fortified lines on kennesaw mtn are necessary and inevitable had we broken his line today it would have been most decisive as it is our loss is small compared with some of those east
2187271 as a corps commander i regarded the morale of the army greatly impaired after the fall of atlanta and in fact before its fall the troops were not by any means in good spirits the majority of the officers and men were so impressed with the idea of their inability to carry even temporary breastworks that when orders were given for attack and there was a probability of encountering works they did not generally move to the attack with that spirit which nearly always assures success
2187272 early in the same night while i was trying to gather up some of our division that had been scattered in the pursuit of the federals i came upon general hood sitting on a cracker box as i approached he looked up at me and i could see tears streaming down his cheeks his brigade had lost heavily and all about him were the dead and wounded i spoke to him and he replied brokenly just look here major at all these dead and suffering men and every one of them as good as i am yet i am untouched this would be true only a little longer for the gallant hood left an arm at gettysburg and a leg on the bloody field of chickamauga
2187273 is this the fourth texas asked hood this is all that remains was the reply tears rolled down the generals cheeks as he rode away and there was not a soldier in that line but what thought more of him now than ever before
2187274 the sad eyed hood wept as he told lee of the hundreds of his texans and georgians who had fallen that day in the cornfield
2187275 they are lying upon the field where you sent them sir
2187276 his sturdy visage assumed a melancholy appearance and for a considerable time he sat on his horse and wept like a child
2187277 i was at general hoods headquarters he was much agitated and affected pulling his hair with his one hand he had but one and crying like his heart would break i pitied him poor fellow
2187278 had hood succeeded nashville would have opened her gates to the head of his victorious legions and the throat of tennessee released from the grasp of remorseless despotism it was worth the hazard its failure does not diminish the value of the prize
2187279 it has been charged that he hood gave the order to attack at franklin because of chagrin at his failure at spring hill this supposition does hood great injustice a federal courier had been captured bearing dispatches between thomas and schofield of the federal army the tenor of the dispatches led hood to believe that franklin was not in a defensible position and that therefore as he expressed it he thought his time to fight had come
2187280 but i was absorbed in the one man whose mind was deciding the fate of thousands with an arm and a leg in the grave and with the consciousness that he had not until within a couple of days won the confidence which his army had in his predecessor he had now a very trying ordeal to pass through it was all important to act if at all at once
2187281 great infantry or cavalry charges are as often remembered for the ones that failed as for the ones that succeeded on july 3 1863 general robert e lee sent 15 000 infantry under george pickett charging into the union lines at gettysburg the resulting failure presaged the decline of the confederacy a decade earlier englands lord cardigan had dispatched his light brigade of cavalry to charge against a strong russian position during the crimean war and nearly all were killed or wounded this became the stuff that poems were made of in world war i millions of soldiers were killed in frontal infantry assaults it was likewise with the japanese in world war ii who died by the tens of thousands in pointless banzai charges
2187282 the psychology of the tactic was a leftover from the days of the rock the club the spear and the sword in which battles were won or lost in close combat with one side ultimately overwhelming and terrifying the other by dint of sheer audacity and ferocity with the evolution of gunpowder and weapons of distance rifles cannons and the like personal physical prowess had become less and less important still as military scholars continue to emphasize most wars are fought on the strategies and tactics gleaned from the previous one yet men commanding warriors of the nineteenth and even twentieth century were slow to understand this
2187283 on the 2nd day before the battle of franklin nov 28 while acting as a scout for gen hood i was directed by him to take twelve men and reconnoiter in the vicinity of murfreesboro and as near nashville as i could safely go for the purpose of locating the enemy and finding out his plans of the men who were with me i can now only recall tom king bob herd alf snell and a man by the name of henton i was instructed after making my tour to report to gen claborne the following morning who would be incamped at caney springs about daylight of the morning before the battle of franklin 29th we rode into caney springs and as we approached it we discovered that an army was encamped there naturally we thought it was gen claborne however we soon learned that it was a yankee outfit we reconnoitered and located the marque or headquarters of gen hatch and we decided to capture the general we quietly and silently dismounted walked up to the headquarters disarmed the sentinel went into the tent and captured the adjutant and his body guard we then took them out and mounted them on horses which were tied to a corell and carried them to gen hoods headquarters we also captured many papers which disclosed their plans and purposes we met gen hood about fifteen miles from caney springs on the road to columbia
2187284 the enemy were greatly excited we could see them running to and fro wagon trains were being pressed across the harpeth river and on toward nashville
2187285 in speaking of this battle very many are inclined to wonder at the terrible pertinacity of the rebel general hood in dashing column after column with such tremendous force and energy upon our center involving their decimation almost their annihilation yet this we have considered a most brilliant design and the brightest record of his generalship that will be preserved in history he was playing a stupendous game for enormous stakes could he have succeeded in breaking the center our whole army was at his mercy in our rear was a deep and rapid river swollen by recent rains only fordable by infantry at one or two places and to retreat across it an utter impossibility to break the center was to defeat our army and defeat inevitably involved a surrender if this army surrendered to him nashville with all its fortifications all its vast accumulation of army stores was at his mercy and could be taken in a day hence with heavy odds a vastly superior force in his hands he made the impetuous attack upon our center and lost in the momentous game his army well understood that they were fighting for the possession of nashville ours knew they were fighting to preserve that valuable city and to avoid annihilation
2187286 by the way i was somewhat surprised and may say pained during my recent trip south to note the disposition among soldiers of the late confederate army to criticize and disparage the merits of gen
2187287 i have been with general hood from the beginning of this campaign and beg to say disastrous as it has ended i am not able to see anything that general hood has done that he should not or neglected anything that he should have done which it was possible to do
2187288 hood had served with distinction under lee and stonewall jackson and his tactics were of that school if he had by an impetuous attack crushed schofields army we should never have heard complaint because hood attacked at franklin and these were the hopes with which he made his assault
2187289 when we discovered their successful escape on the morning of the 30th our chagrin and disappointment can be better imagined than described general forrest was so enraged that his face turned almost to a chalky whiteness and his lips quivered he cursed out some of the commanding officers and censured them for allowing the federal army to escape i looked at him as he sat in his saddle pouring forth his volumes of wrath and was almost thunderstruck to listen to him and to see no one dare resent it
2187290 the same blow delivered with equal power at spring hill or thompsons station would have yielded us dominion over tennessee a failure to obey hoods order lost us a noble commonwealth
2187291 i explained that a grave responsibility rested upon the general who failed to make the attack at spring hill as we knew our advantage and hood had ordered the attack
2187292 gen jackson in all his campaigns never planned a movement that gave greater promise of success than did the movement of gen hood at spring hill gen hood said in his report that he gave gen cheatham positive orders in person while in sight of the turnpike at spring hill to attack the retreating enemy and place his men across the pike he said further that he sent staff officers to cheatham several times after that urging him to place troops across the pike to intercept the fleeing federals maj blanton and maj hamilton both of hoods staff each told me personally that he had carried the orders to gen cheatham that grand old hero gen hood died without ever defending himself allowing the world to believe that he was responsible for the failure
2187293 it has been charged that he hood gave the order to attack at franklin because of chagrin at his failure at spring hill this supposition does hood great injustice a federal courier had been captured bearing dispatches between thomas and schofield of the federal army the tenor of the dispatches led hood to believe that franklin was not in a defensible position and that therefore as he expressed it he thought his time to fight had come
2187294 general hoods last words to his generals were now go down to the work to be done and go at it
2187295 many we know will disagree with us but we think to calmly and impartially view general hoods course we will be forced to accord to him abilities of the highest order and a military commander with but few superiors what became of general hood for the remainder of the war we do not know but if he was removed for failure in tennessee he was treated very unjustly that he did so we believe was no fault of his he failed simply because he had not men and supplies to contend with the immense force that was against him
2187296 gen hood was a brave man and while he never won the affections of his men as some other commanders did we may say peace to his ashes for he was a good soldier and a true southern man
2187297 few generals have possessed the warm personal love of their men as hood did this attachment was something different from any feeling i have ever known to exist between men and commander
2187298 a splendid soldier peculiarly suited to the command of his reckless daring and indomitable texans commander and men alike never knew when they were beaten or when they must be
2187299 there was about him some of the effulgence of the true captain of men anyone who had followed the operations of the army after gainess mill would have said that of all the officers under longstreet the most likely to be a great soldier was hood
2187300 the strong force of hoods character yielded an influence that no oratory could command and he passed his days after the war refined by sorrow purified by aspiration strengthened through self reliance and made gentle by an earnest faith in things unseen he was genial generous and indulgent toward others and severe to himself his aims were prompted by noble desires and in politics his ideals for democratic action were high with all his limitations which he recognized as well as his powers he commands our admiration and respect
2187301 about 300 yankee bounty jumpers and prisoners in the yard yelled with delight and declared their readiness to rejoin hood
2187302 general hood was relieved at his reiterated request and that it was in no wise due to a want of confidence in him on my part
2187303 hood is a good fighter very industrious on the battlefield careless off and i have had no opportunity of judging his action when the whole responsibility rested upon him i have a very high opinion of his gallantry earnestness and zeal general hardee has more experience in managing an army may god give you wisdom to decide in this momentous matter
2187304 it was the most terrible and disastrous blow the south ever received
2187305 a circular from gen johnston announces that he has been removed from command of this army and that gen hood succeeds him gen johnston has so endeared himself to his soldiers that no man can take his place
2187306 all over camp not only among texas troops can be seen this demoralization and at all hours in the afternoon can be heard hurrah for joe johnston and god d n jeff davis the noise and confusion was kept up all night if jeff davis had made his appearance in this army during the excitement he would not have lived an hour
2187307 our government had placed hood in command and as such i yielded to him my confidence and cordial cooperation
2187308 the removal of general johnston and the appointment of hood to succeed him in command of the army of tennessee was an astounding event so devoted to johnston were his men that the presence and immediate command of general robert e lee would not have been accepted without complaint
2187309 at the commencement of a campaign to advance or not to advance is a matter for grave consideration but when once the offensive has been assumed it must be sustained to the last extremity however skillful the maneuvers in a retreat it will always weaken the morale of an army because in losing the chances of success these last are transferred to the enemy besides retreats always cost more men and materiel than the most bloody engagements with this difference that in a battle the enemys loss is nearly equal to your own whereas in a retreat the loss is on your side only
2187310 if you delay attacking longer the mortifying spectacle will be witnessed of a rebel army moving for the ohio
2187311 i was just on my way to nashville but receiving a dispatch from van duzer detailing your splendid success of today i shall go no further
2187312 until hood reaches the country proper of the enemy he can scarcely change grants or shermans campaigns
2187313 no victory is possible without a vigorous commander ready for responsibility eager for daring enterprises himself possessing and inspiring in others the determination and energy that will go through to the end
2187314 even by the fall of 1864 the southern people and their leaders were not prepared to admit that their task consisted in prolonging what had patently become nearly a hopeless defense there was still a hope that a bold and aggressive campaign would splendidly retrieve the situation in the west and relieve the pressure on lees embattled front it was a desperate remedy for a desperate military and political situation and hood by the logic of his appointment to command of the army in place of j e johnston was called upon to lead in this forlorn hope that he came so near to success is a tribute to his indomitable faith and courage and to the real ability played in a campaign that on several occasions put him within reach of victory
2187315 and yet a silent factor of no little importance which undoubtedly influenced davis in connection with his agitation for a movement into tennessee was the approaching northern election lincoln was standing for reelection and for a vindication of his policies and conduct of the war while mcclellan and the democrats accused of being allied with the southern sympathizing copperheads declared the war to be a failure and sought to replace lincoln and his party in the northern leadership a bold stroke by hood even if uncompleted by election time davis probably felt would strengthen the opposition to the lincoln government and might even force it from office and thus it was hoped lead to the opening of peace negotiations or of foreign recognition considering the uncertain state of northern opinion at the time as evidenced in the daily press there is much to be said in favor of such an attitude on the part of davis a move by hood into tennessee would be positive rather than negative the confederacy had everything to gain and no more to lose than was actually lost the existing political situation in its foreign and domestic aspects and the military situation both made such a move seem worth the trial
2187316 be of good cheer for within a short while your faces will be turned homeward and your feet pressing tennessee soil
2187317 it was my opinion that the army should take up the offensive with the hope that favorable opportunities would be offered for striking the enemy successfully thus ensuring the efficiency of the army for future operations
2187318 i deem it proper to say that after the fall of atlanta the condition of the army and other considerations rendered it necessary in my judgment that an offensive campaign should be made in the enemys rear and on his line of communications
2187319 the removal of general johnston and the appointment of hood to succeed him in command of the army of tennessee was an astounding event so devoted to johnston were his men that the presence and immediate command of general robert e lee would not have been accepted without complaint
2187320 if the present system continues we may find ourselves at atlanta before a serious battle is fought
2187321 are we to hold still remaining on the defensive in this position until sherman comes down with his combined armies to drive us out
2187322 at the commencement of the withdrawal of the army from the lines on the night of the 2d it began to disintegrate and straggling from the ranks increased up to the surrender on the 9th on that day as previously reported there were only seven thousand eight hundred and ninety two 7892 effective infantry during the night when the surrender became known more than ten thousand men came in as reported to me by the chief commissary of the army during the succeeding days stragglers continued to give themselves up so that on the 12th april according to the rolls of those paroled twenty six thousand and eighteen 26 01 officers and men had surrendered men who had left the ranks on the march and crossed james river returned and gave themselves up and many have since come to richmond and surrendered
2187323 more than ten thousand had stopped and allowed themselves to be captured
2187324 it is true that we were sadly repulsed at nashville but he hood brought off the larger portion of the army with quartermaster commissary medical and ordnance trains
2187325 by this time nearly all the tennesseans were gone home they either had written furloughs or took french leave deserted
2187326 may have been taking a derivative of laudanum to ease his pain
2187327 perhaps from use of laudanum to dull his constant pain
2187328 especially if he took any liquor or a drug to relax
2187329 old soldiers and old residents around spring hill explain all that nights fumbling in blunt terms
2187330 it was a legend of the countryside for many years after that hood was drunk that night
2187331 laboring under intense pain his hoods mind was often clouded by pain killing drugs

2187395 i seek the whereabouts of a caravan that wouldve gone by this way a few days ago it did not arrive and i was sent to see if i could determine its whereabouts i happened to hear the commotion with the werewolves and some of your people and decided to lend a hand
2187396 that is not uncommon nor have i heard any rumors of waylayed travelers for i keep to my myself mosty there are those among us who while their time away with mixed company
2187397 they may have heard some news that i have not
2187398 might you have a healing potion could i borrow some clothes
2187399 go get my herbs that i left out there and ask leo or clay or someone for some mens clothing no questions asked
2187400 what would you charge for the administration of curative herbs
2187401 oh there is no way i could charge you for the honor of ministering to your wounds especially after you saved us from those wolves nay nothing more than a token to commemorate our meeting would i even consider taking
2187402 would you like my personal rune upon thy person or wagon
2187403 now let us see to those wounds before we seek the information that you need
2187404 i thank you good woman those werewolves were quite unhappy when i crashed their party i have scribed my rune on the inside of your door so as not to attract undue attention from parties disinclined to my views of life
2187405 now shall we inquire to this caravan that you seek i think clay would be the best to ask let us go boy
2187406 act as though i am a weary traveler the dragon has flown away
2187407 leo is a sharp man he may not buy your ruse
2187408 the dragon left not wanting to stain himself with such rude and vulgar company
2187409 and as i watched the shining one fly off into the moonlit sky this one approached me warn from travel with many questions the answers for which i divined would best be sought by yourself or clay will you answer them or send this weary one packing
2187410 well what have you to say for yourself traveler i am sure you will understand my caution we have had many ordeals this night and are in need of safe sleep
2187411 good evening sir i was traveling along the road when i stepped into the brush a little to relieve myself after i had finished i felt a sharp pain in my neck and passed out for a spell when i came to i was without my small purse and had quite a headache i stumbled forward through the brush close to the road seeking to stay hidden from highwaymen for a couple hours and i heard a commotion and a great howling of wolves i climbed a tree to get away and i saw a fire off in the distance after the howling had stopped and i saw no wolves i shimmied back down and headed toward the fire hoping for a cup of soup of some coffee i came across this woman here looking into the sky a couple minutes ago she was in the company of your giant friend over there and told her what i have just told you

2187424 the courts would not be justified in withholding that benefit because of acquittal might have an impact upon the law and order situation or create adverse reaction in society or amongst those members of the society who believe the accused to be guilty the guilt of the accused has to be adjudged not by the fact that a vast number of people believe him to be guilty but whether his guilt has been established by the evidence brought on record indeed the courts have hardly any other yardstick or material to adjudge the guilt of the person arraigned as accused
2187425 it is the obligation of every court to find out the truth and act according to law once the truth is discovered in that search for truth obviously the court has to function within the bounce set by law and act on the evidence placed before it what happens outside the court rooms when the court is busy in its process of adjudication is indeed in irrelevant and unless a proper cushion is provided to keep the proceedings within the court room dissociated from the heat generated outside the court room either through the news media or through flutter in the public mind the cause of justice is bound to suffer
2187426 it is the outcome of cool deliberations and the screening of the material by the informed mind of the judge that leads to determination of the lis if the cushion is lost and the court room is allowed to vibrate with the heat generated outside it the adjudicatory process suffers and the search for truth is stifled
2187427 the courts cannot allow any emotional and sentimental feelings to come into judicial pronouncements once sentimental and emotions feelings are allowed to enter the judicial mind the judge is bound to view the evidence with a bias and in that case the conclusion may also be biased resulting in some cases in great injustice the cases have to be decided strictly on evidence howsoever cruel or horrifying the crime may be all possible chances of innocent man being convicted have to be ruled out there should be no hostile atmosphere against an accused in court a hostile atmosphere is bound to interfere in an unbiased approach as well as a decision this has to be avoided at all costs

2187503 cult lawyers to sue ex cult members and critics often using fabricated evidence and causing finacial stress by repeated trivial law suits the cults aim is not so much to win the lawsuit though they often do as to harass and intimidate their critics into silence conversion into a cult is usually the result of two interacting dynamics the first is the personal vulnerability of the potential recruit this vulnerability may be enhanced by but not limited to transitional situations such as divorce abuse job or career change moving away from home or leaving college an illness or death of a loved one the second dynamic are the tactics used to convert indoctrinate brainwash and hold the members some groups attempt a radical and rapid conversion over an intensive week end or week such as the forum or scientology others have a more subtle approach which may take weeks or months such as the jehovahs witnesses the following are techniques of unethical thought reform and mind control any person will act so as to reduce conflict between their thoughts their emotions and their behaviour when these things are at odds with each other a person experiences dissonance

2187631 greetings great one headmaster dreedle is expecting you i i will take you to him if you will follow me
2187632 lead on brave one so we can quickly get to the heart of the matter at hand
2187633 i am headmaster dreedle and i welcome you to our academy young one may i ask your name i must admit i am some what surprised that your elders would send one so young to us
2187634 i am namhais and have been a student of the ways of gathering information my elders thought that i had what was needed
2187635 and the experience i gain here would further distinguish me in their eyes
2187636 and curtious too i see well if your elders thought you best for the job then that is good enough for me
2187637 please follow me to my office there you shall find refreshment while we discuss the matter at hand
2187638 please have a seat my good dragon and help your selves to some refreshments
2187639 about three days ago we at the academy were expecting an incredibly important caravan the center of that caravan was a treasured prophessor named athinaseous a wise wizard and scholar of the arcane arts by human standards
2187640 and though i am greatly worried about the lateness of a dear friend i am also extremely worried about the lateness of his cargo which is in the wrong hands could prove very disasterous they were a collection of rare arcanite crystals which we had borrowed from another wizard academy for research do you or your kin know of these crystals
2187641 i remember that these crystals can grant great boons to a persons arcane powers but if used for too long the crystals consume the weilder truly if these have fallen into fell hands it would be of great import to get them back as soon as possible
2187642 we had confidence that the transport of these crystals 2 of them to be precise was a complete secret one reason we sent such a small unassuming caravan was to keep any attention from it but something is delaying aethinatious and we cannot locate him through scrying or any other magical means which makes me think the worst that some very powerful person or creature has found out about the crystals taken them and put a wall up that we cannot bypass
2187643 there must be a spy on these grounds for we have this place protected by many anti scrying spells under our very noses for not everyone in the school new about the crystals
2187644 what i ask of you by good namhias is that you travel down the road that the caravan would have taken to find it or any news of it and if the worst has happened to recover the arcanite crystals for us discover the villians who have done this and if possible find the mole that is in this school which i presume you will find once you discover the crystals and who has them are you up to this task
2187645 and i have a tool that might be useful to you on this quest if you should take it on
2187646 it is a pendant that can increase your natural ability to change shape which i dare say will come in handy for you will have to travel through highly populated lands and perhapse walk the streets of a big city can the academy count on your help in this grave matter
2187647 aye i will do this i pray that these have not fallen into my sad to say chromatic kin in any way i shall need to examine the route the caravan was to take as well as how many vehicles and other personnel were in this caravan besides your wizard friend
2187648 yes yes let us see here is a list of those taking part in the carivan there was aethinatious his aprentis caleb another wizard by the name of stuarth and 3 no 4 guards dressed as merchants a small caravan to not draw attention
2187649 and on this page a map of the carefully plotted path
2187650 as you see there was a meeting between roth regent wizarding college and us at a disclosed location a special place only known by a few
2187651 then the caravan took the grey road north for a fort night turning east and passing the city of gull there i think they were to stop for a day or two then travel for another three days into the hinterlands and then to this very academy i wont presume to tell you the best way to find them my friend but there are certain to be some sign of them along their predesignated path or even in the city of gull
2187652 hmmm it probably wasnt common thieves because with 2 wizards and an apprentice in the party they couldve easily taken out the highwaymen
2187653 if they were subjects of something foul it mustve been at the hands of someone very powerful very sneaky or both
2187654 my hope is that it is neither i wish it were that some simple issue has delayed them but i know athinaseous and he would have contacted me if it were so
2187655 but knowing that you will be looking into it my draconic friend eases my anxiety some so i thank you and i wish you good fortune on your our quest
2187656 this is the schools emblem it might come in handy if you need to interact with the local authorities in the region of gull if they see the symbol i dare say they will give you the help you need but keep it hidden and show it only to those who you think you can trust
2187657 now is there anything else you need from me or any other questions you would like to ask
2187658 i have a couple more questions first what does athinaseous look like secondly do you know what types of vehicles such as carts and wagons the caravan was using thirdly do you know if the arcanite stones had any distinguishing characteristics like coloration that might distinguish them
2187659 first athinaseous is a tall man with pointed features especially his nose which is very long last time i saw him which was the day he left for this journey and he had his silver hair trimmed oh ide say shoulder length and hazel eyes as for his clothing he wouldnt have dressed as a wizard but as a commoner he is clean shaven except for his side whiskers now caleb his apprentise is age 16 with short blond hair bowl cut and incredibly freckled with blue eyes
2187660 as for the crystals there is the bramon emerald which is about six inches long and 2 wide
2187661 and as its name suggests it is green in color and has been cut and mounted into a gold braket the other crystal is known as the ice shard for it uncut and frosty blue in color and about a foot long wide and flat
2187662 it was just a pair of horse drawn wagons one was a supply cart and the other a wagon in which passangers slept and rode both were very ordinary and unassuming on the outside i hope that helps
2187663 ok ive got a pretty good idea of what to look for thank you headmaster deedle hopefully i can bring this to a happy conclusion in a short time with you reuinted with your friend and in possession of the 2 missing crystals
2187664 that would be great indeed but in all my years experience rarely have such matters been resolved quickly especially when wizards and magical items are involved but either way farewell my friend and good fortune on your travels
2187665 actually milord deedle i was hoping to leave by your window does it open
2187666 well yes of course that would be preferable to you wouldnt it
2187667 i tried to expand the panel in the window for a few seconds
2187668 but ill have to figure out how to do it to glass without it shattering you can use the window now i will repair it once you leave
2187669 that would be the guards checking to make sure im allright
2187670 an eagle should be a lot less out of the ordinary than a silver dragon
2187671 this matter concerns you not be gone lest we feast on your flesh
2187672 and what part do you play in this she wolf what is your quarry besides you wouldnt want to eat me dragon meat is tough and the magic within me might explode and take you all with me
2187673 we will peel your hide off your flesh then and save our appetites for the pink flesh of the humans
2187674 forget the dragon you fools get the food i will keep him occupied
2187675 i will enjoy peeling that pretty skin off your flesh it shall make a fine suite of armor for me
2187676 youve never faced a dragon before have you i hope you like being ripped to shreds
2187677 if your puny mouth can even hurt me here let me show you how its done
2187678 you may have had the advantage of surprise this time whelp
2187679 but beleive me when i say i will hunt you down and take my revenge it is you that will be taken by surprise next time
2187680 benrick said he saw a dragon out in the field swooping down on them
2187681 a dragon is worse than a pack of hungry werewolves
2187682 do you think cryfhau is ok a lot of those wolf things jumped on him as we were running away
2187683 if anyone can take care of himself cor its cryfhau youll see hell be back in no time hell probably even kill that dragon if there really is one
2187684 all is clear one of the twins went through the trees to scout the area most of the wolves are dead and there was no sign of anything alive all of the animals are safe though spooked everyone else is ok
2187685 no cor not yet and i fear to send anyone out to seak him
2187686 everyone is acounted for and there is no loss and you all know that we have cryfhau to thank for that
2187687 not to mention whatever else killed those things that got past him
2187688 and i say youve been drinkin too much more than likely they killed themselves squabling over us
2187689 as i was saying we have cryfhau to thank for this if he hadnt held off those wolves at the gorge then those that got by him would have caught up to us sooner than they did an as you all can see he hasnt returned yet i think it is the least we could do to send out a search party to go and find him and help him back here if he needs it
2187690 but hes shown his true colors often enough and its time we show the same decensy so do i have any volunteers or do i have to make a few volunteers myself
2187691 excelent and with me that makes 4 that should be a good sized group to move quickly over the terrain
2187692 clay you are in charge of camp until i get back
2187693 there is something else here will the others be safe while we are gone
2187694 at least they are probably safer than we are but let us not tarry here we must find cryfhau quickly
2187695 and if we find more of those werewolves with him
2187696 we will deal with that when we get to it
2187697 looks a lot less painful than being frozen ill give you that
2187698 you are hurt is is that a bite did one of those creatures bite you
2187699 i think so but what about the others are you all safe
2187700 i tried to keep them all off of your trail but some got by
2187701 yes we are safe your deed gave us time to get to some sort of safety
2187702 seems youre not the only monster thats got our back
2187703 there are no werewolves left here not after i was surprised by the large one
2187704 and if you have been biten we need to get you to mariana to see what can be done
2187705 can you walk i am afraid none of us can carry you
2187706 the giant has been bit by a werewolf and needs my herbology to cure the insuing affliction
2187707 yes and only a fortune teller could have figured that out since none of us were chased by werewolves tonight
2187708 does it have the sensation of creeping up your arm or does it burn do you taste blood are you particularly sensative to moon light at the moment
2187709 it does burn but there is no creeping sensation i dont think im sensative to moon light and im pretty sure im not tasting blood i do have a headache though but most of me aches right now
2187710 my boy i think you are fine you do not have lycanthropy though you are very wounded please let us put a paultice on your wound before they get infected
2187711 do not be alarmed but we have a visitor and i am guessing it is he who vanquished our attackers this evening
2187712 it is disquised as a marsupial but with my true seeing i have penetrated the
2187713 tell us what it is and where before i shake the information out of you
2187714 for by my many years of arcane training i know that it is a silver dragon and that from that race we have nothing to fear
2187715 i told ye i saw me a dragon jus as we thought we were dun fer
2187716 then what in the nine hells are you all running for
2187717 produce him if this isnt just another one of your performaces
2187718 as if i could command one such as a dragon to come forth at my will
2187719 if it pleases you to show yourself to us we would be most obliged though there are among us the ignorant and the violent we are all alike indepted for your protection and your presense in our humble midsts
2187720 why trouble me the giant did far more than i
2187721 yes but if not for you then we surely would be doomed
2187722 come to your wagon and i will talk with you
2187723 if i pass away please bury me with my hand phone
2187724 you come home first i wanna tell you something very important
2187725 dont try to fool me tell summera to come out i have a gift for her please stop this nonsense

2187745 semuanya akan naik khusus di industri pariwisata dan hiburan akan terbeban dengan kenaikan transportasi dan harga makanan makanan di tempat hiburan
2187746 wisatawan lokal dan mancanegara yang datang tidak lagi mengeluarkan untuk belanja dikhawatirkan mereka datang hanya berkunjung sementara karena tidak memiliki bujet yang banyak untuk liburan
2187747 wisatawan lokal maupun mancanegara berkontribusi langsung pada industri retail indonesia jadi efek dari kenaikan bbm negatif dan merugikan semua kalangan
2187748 biasanya para tamu yang meninggalkan kamar namun tv dalam keadaan stand by pihak hotel otomatis akan mematikan tv tersebut itu langkah kecil yang selama ini kami lakukan
2187749 pihak manajemen plaza indonesia dan ex dalam waktu dekat ini tidak berencana menaikkan sewa tenant atau tempat menurut kami masih ada jalan lain yang bisa diambil selain membebaskan tenant apalagi dampaknya nanti harga produk ikut naik
2187750 sebagai penghematan pihak management mencoba kolaborasi dengan perusahaan penerbangan rokok dan lainnya dalam mengadakan acara langkah tersebut juga efektif untuk menghemat tetapi pengunjung yang datang tetap puas
2187751 sampai triwulan pertama saja jumlah wisatawan lokal dan mancanegara bertambah 15 persen saya optimistis di semester pertama kenaikannya lebih tinggi lagi ditambah lagi tempat tempat wisata di indonesia tergolong murah dibandingkan dengan negara lain
2187752 saya rasa yang terancam justru tempat wisata di luar negeri kalau tempat wisata di dalam negeri kemungkinan akan semakin dibanjiri oleh wisatawan lokal dan mancanegara
2187753 krisis energi dan kenaikan bbm jangan dipandang sebelah mata pasti ada jalan keluarnya tetapi untuk target pemerintah meningkatkan tempat wisata lokal saya masih tetap optimistis
2187754 pemimpin negara seperti tidak berpikir panjang dalam membuat keputusan atau mengambil kebijakan pejabat negara tidak berbeda dengan seniman yang banyak melakukan improvisasi dalam bermusik

2187762 bagaimana ar ini tak bisa dibiarkan citra kampus ini bakal merosot tajam hanya karena ulah segelintir dosen dan mahasiswa pembuat skripsi bukan hanya itu saya malu kalau kampus tercinta ini hanya jadi tempat berkuasanya orang orang pembual kita harus berbuat sesuatu
2187763 benar katamu salah satu dosen itu adalah dosen waliku yang kerap menasehatiku soal kerja keras padahal beliau juga seorang pemain skripsi ya kita harus berbuat sesuatu
2187764 sudahlah kawan saya paham maksudmu tapi kamu kan tahu sendiri bagaimana tabiat rektorat kita selalu kehabisan nyali bila berhadapan dengan rekan sejawatnya yang menyeleweng dari koridor akademik
2187765 benar kawan tapi kali ini bukan soal siapa yang harus menanggungnya tapi soal masa depan kita kawan bayangkan
2187766 ok kawan praktek pembuatan skripsi jelas bukanlah potret pendidikan yang memanusiakan manusia sebagaimana diajarkan dosen kita itu
2187767 sambil tertawa ar ar sudahlah jangan padamkan semangatmu dengan bersikap skeptis bahwa orang lain tidak berpikir seperti kita ok masih ada kok dosen yang pakai suara hati
2187768 kenapa harus saya dan teman teman itu yang harus menanggungnya bukankah mata dosen dan bebarapa oknum yang melakukan penjualan skripsi itu mengawasi gerak gerik kami dan bukankah bisa jadi akan marah dan berbuat sesuatu yang membahayakan kami mengapa mengapa pihak lembaga begitu takut
2187769 maaf kawan saya pergi saja ini tidak adil sungguh tidak adil
2187770 itu artinya kamu mengkhianati perjuangan kita sudahlah silakan pergi orang seperti kamu tak layak memperjuangkan perubahan yang lebih baik
2187771 kalau kamu berpikir bahwa dosen dosen di gedung itu tak berbuat apa apa silakan atau mungkin kamu sering mencari sesuap rejeki dengan cara seperti orang orang yang jual beli skripsi itu
2187772 kenapa harus saya dan teman teman mahasiswa saja lalu bagaimana dengan pihak yayasan dan rektorat bajingan itu
2187773 i know time will come but i wont give up ill stay strong

2187777 para qu voy a vender a un jugador en 3 millones de d lares si el a o que viene lo puedo vender en diez
2187778 la gata no se vende ac hay una gran operaci n de prensa para venderlo pero yo no quiero que el jugador se venda y menos en por el dinero que est n ofreciendo cerca de 3 000 000 de d lares y s que marcelo tinelli ram n d az y rafael savino tampoco
2187779 ac hay un intermediario que maneja a cierto sector de la prensa porque al jugador le ofrecen un contrato muy importante en m xico por eso est n presionando para que se vaya no s debe haber un dinero grande que alguien se debe estar llevando en caso que sea transferido el futbolista
2187780 algunos minimizan el esfuerzo que estoy haciendo diciendo que yo quiero vender a la gata pero el presidente y tinelli saben cu l es mi posici n para qu voy a vender a un jugador en 3 millones de d lares si el a o que viene lo puedo hacer en 10
2187781 con marcelo tinelli conformamos un grupo con el objetivo de reforzar al plantel hicimos un aporte de dinero compramos a torres a gast n fern ndez apoyamos al club cuando tuvo algunos problemas financieros como con los documentos del pase de silvera organizamos la fiesta de san lorenzo campe n mir como el grupo nuestro tiene la mayor a del pase de la gata se tendr a que haber hecho un pr stamo al club pero nosotros no lo hicimos el club no pag un solo peso porque nuestra intenci n no es hacer negocios con san lorenzo es m s la parte que ten a que pagar el club que eran 400 000 d lares y que lo hizo con documentos como river quer a que est n avalados por un banco suizo cosa imposible porque el club ven a de una convocatoria river me pidi a mi si pod a salir como aval ya que tengo la est tica del estadio monumental as que yo firm los documentos
2187782 la semana que viene voy a tomar una decisi n porque la pol tica del club me tiene harto se piensan que quiero ser candidato yo me siento campe n como hincha y por la plata que puse en todos los pr stamos que le hice al club jam s le ped un centavo de m s o alg n porcentaje de jugadores nada y sino que savino diga si alguna vez le ped algo a cambio estoy molesto porque dentro del oficialismo hay gente que no quiere que colaboren y que san lorenzo tenga la fiesta que tuvo en vez de estar contentos se sienten celosos envidiosos y yo ayudo al club no a los dirigentes

2187797 if you turn on your computer it will come up instantly where it was when you turned it off that is a very interesting potential application and one that is very realistic
2187798 its essential that people understand this to be able to go further into the world of nanoelectronics

2187800 esa era la ltima compadre d jela en veleta no mah que ya terminamos
2187801 detectives found it during their search while looking along the route she took
2187802 il petrolio e gli altri combustibili fossili sono in via di esaurimento ma anche luranio destinato a scarseggiare entro 35 40 anni non possiamo continuare perci a elaborare piani energetici sulla base di previsioni sbagliate che rischiano di portarci fuori strada dobbiamo sviluppare la pi importante fonte energetica che la natura mette da sempre a nostra disposizione senza limiti a costo zero e cio il sole che ogni giorno illumina e riscalda la terra
2187803 quando stato costruito lultimo reattore in america nel 1979 trentanni fa quanto conta il nucleare nella produzione energetica francese circa il 20 per cento ma i costi altissimi dei loro 59 reattori sono stati sostenuti di fatto dallo stato per mantenere larsenale atomico ricordiamoci che per costruire una centrale nucleare occorrono 8 10 anni di lavoro che la tecnologia proposta si basa su un combustibile luranio appunto di durata limitata poi resta in tutto il mondo il problema delle scorie
2187804 non esiste un nucleare sicuro o a bassa produzione di scorie esiste un calcolo delle probabilit per cui ogni cento anni un incidente nucleare possibile e questo evidentemente aumenta con il numero delle centrali
2187805 il carbone la fonte energetica pi inquinante pi pericolosa per la salute dellumanit ma non si risolve il problema nascondendo lanidride carbonica sotto terra in realt nessuno dice quanto tempo debba restare eppure la co2 dura in media fino a 30 mila anni contro i 22 mila del plutonio no il ritorno al carbone sarebbe drammatico disastroso
2187806 c un impianto per la produzione di energia solare costruito nel deserto del nevada su progetto spagnolo costa 200 milioni di dollari produce 64 megawatt e per realizzarlo occorrono solo 18 mesi con 20 impianti di questo genere si produce un terzo dellelettricit di una centrale nucleare da un gigawatt e i costi oggi ancora elevati si potranno ridurre considerevolmente quando verranno costruiti in gran quantit basti pensare che un ipotetico quadrato di specchi lungo 200 chilometri per ogni lato potrebbe produrre tutta lenergia necessaria allintero pianeta e unarea di queste dimensioni equivale appena allo 0 1 per cento delle zone desertiche del cosiddetto sun belt per rifornire di elettricit un terzo dellitalia unarea equivalente a 15 centrali nucleari da un gigawatt basterebbe un anello solare grande come il raccordo di roma
2187807 i nuovi impianti solari termodinamici a concentrazione catturano lenergia e la trattengono in speciali contenitori fino a quando serve poi attraverso uno scambiatore di calore si produce il vapore che muove le turbine n pi n meno come una diga che negli impianti idroelettrici ferma lacqua e al momento opportuno la rilascia per alimentare la corrente

2187811 to invest successfully you need not understand beta efficient markets modern portfolio theory option pricing or emerging markets you may in fact be better off knowing nothing of these that of course is not the prevailing view at most business schools whose finance curriculum tends to be dominated by such subjects in our view though investment students need only two well taught courses how to value a business and how to think about market prices

2187815 a judge jury and executioner that was encouraged by an out of control reality show

2187823 artinya sesungguhnya ia tidak pernah membawa kebaikan dan sesungguhnya ia hanya dikeluarkan bersumber dari orang yang bakhil
2187824 artinya dan di antara mereka ada orang yang berikrar kepada allah sesungguhnya jika allah memberikan sebahagian dari karunianya kepada kami pasti kami akan bersedekah dan pastilah kami termasuk orang orang yang shalih maka setelah allah memberikan kepada mereka sebahagian dari karunianya mereka kikir dengan karunia itu dan berpaling dan mereka memanglah orang orang yang selalu membelakangi kebenaran maka allah menimbulkan kemunafikan pada hati mereka sampai pada waktu mereka menemui allah karena mereka telah memungkiri terhadap allah apa yang telah mereka ikrarkan kepadanya dan juga karena mereka selalu berdusta

2188015 after the public discovery of gold in the 1870s the conflict over control of the region sparked the last major indian war on the great plains the black hills war the 1868 treaty of fort laramie had previously confirmed the lakota teton sioux ownership of the mountain range but with that treaty being contested they additionally claimed rights to the land saying that in their culture it was considered the axis mundi or sacred center of the world however some consider the claim a dubious pretension to keep the gold rich territory since the sioux tribe had only discovered the black hills about 100 years earlier 1765 and that they themselves took the land by force from its previous residents the cheyenne tribe in 1776

2188030 sekali kali tidak demikian sebenarnya apa yang selalu mereka usahakan itu menutupi hati mereka
2188031 jika kemaksiatan sudah mendominasi umatku maka allah meratakan adzab dari sisi nya
2188032 wahai rasulullah bukankah di antara mereka ada orang orang shalih
2188033 mereka akan mendapat musibah sama dengan yang lain kemudian mereka mendapatkan ampunan dan keridhaan allah
2188034 dan orang orang yang tidak menyembah tuhan yang lain beserta allah dan tidak membunuh jiwa yang diharamkan allah membunuhnya kecuali dengan alasan yang benar dan tidak berzina barang siapa yang melakukan yang demikian itu niscaya dia mendapat pembalasan dosa nya
2188035 dan barangsiapa berpaling dari peringatan ku maka sesungguhnya baginya penghidupan yang sempit dan kami akan menghimpunkannya pada hari kiamat dalam keadaan buta
2188036 karena mereka melanggar janjinya kami kutuki mereka dan kami jadikan hati mereka keras membatu mereka suka mengubah perkataan allah dari tempat tempatnya dan mereka sengaja melupakan sebagian dari apa yang mereka telah diperingatkan dengannya dan kamu muhammad senantiasa akan melihat kekhianatan dari mereka kecuali sedikit diantara mereka yang tidak berkhianat maka maafkanlah mereka dan biarkan mereka sesungguhnya allah menyukai orang orang yang berbuat baik
2188037 saya menyakini bahwa seseorang lupa pada ilmu yang sudah dikuasainya karena dosa yang dilakukan

2188039 saya mengadu pada waqii tentang buruknya hafalanku beliau menasihatiku agar meninggalkan maksiat dan memberitahuku bahwa ilmu adalah cahaya dan cahaya allah tidak diberikan kepada orang yang bermaksiat
2188040 saya melihat dosa dosa itu mematikan hati dan mewariskan kehinaan bagi para pelakunya meninggalkan dosa dosa menyebabkan hidupnya hati sebaik baiknya bagi dirimu meninggalkannya bukankah yang menghancurkan agama itu tidak lain para penguasa dan ahli agama yang jahat dan para rahib
2188041 dosa yang dilakukan tentara islam lebih aku takuti dari musuh mereka sesungguhnya umat islam dimenangkan karena maksiat musuh mereka kepada allah kalau tidak demikian kita tidak mempunyai kekuatan karena jumlah kita tidak sepadan dengan jumlah mereka perlengkapan kita tidak sepadan dengan perlengkapan mereka jika kita sama dalam berbuat maksiat maka mereka lebih memiliki kekuatan jika kita tidak dimenangkan dengan keutamaan kita maka kita tidak dapat mengalahkan mereka dengan kekuatan kita

2188243 concluir o curso de gest o tecnol gica de rh do unibh curso esse formado por professores fant sticos me propiciaram conhecimentos que v o fazer parte de minha vida para sempre
2188244 estar concluindo um curso superior sempre foi meu sonho quando procurei um curso que estivesse alinhado com minha aptid o descobri o curso gest o de rh do unibh cujo objetivo ia de encontro com o que eu buscava hoje ap s quase dois anos no curso tenho a satisfa o de ressaltar a grande qualidade do curso que formado por professores fant sticos sempre tive orgulho ao dizer que sou aluno do unibh
2188245 falar do curso ao seu t rmino me deixa extremamente emocionada sentirei saudades do grande circulo de amizade que conquistei durante os dois anos de curso falando parece pouco mas s eu sei o quanto me tornei diferente cresci muito como pessoa aprendi a receber e aceitar o outro com todas as suas diferen as fico grata pela mudan a que o curso me proporcionou e pelas amizades conquistadas
2188246 ao decidir que curso fazer optei pelo curso gest o de recursos humanos do unibh foi uma decis o primordial em minha vida pois fazer esse curso desenvolveu um lado em mim que precisava ser trabalhado mudei muito tanto pessoalmente quanto profissionalmente pessoalmente mudei meu modo de relacionar com as pessoas respeitar o ser humano com seus defeitos e qualidades e ser mais objetiva com rela o aos meus objetivos j profissionalmente me tornei mais madura e passei a ser mais organizada e mais imparcial no relacionamento com os demais colegas de trabalho o que me proporcionou um novo emprego

2188248 why are you worrying about you know who you should be worrying about u no poo the constipation sensation thats gripping the nation
2188249 i am an extraordinarily lucky person doing what i love best in the world im sure that i will always be a writer it was wonderful enough just to be published the greatest reward is the enthusiasm of the readers
2188250 when i illustrate a cover or a book i draw upon what the author tells me thats how i see my responsibility as an illustrator j k rowling is very descriptive in her writing she gives an illustrator a lot to work with each story is packed full of rich visual descriptions of the atmosphere the mood the setting and all the different creatures and people she makes it easy for me the images just develop as i sketch and retrace until it feels right and matches her vision

2188253 some people have said that the attacks by al qaeda and associated organizations are a reaction undertaken by sons of islam who are zealous in the defence of their religion and in response to the order of their god and prophet
2188254 would you regard further attacks by al qaeda or similar organizations on the usa as justified or unjustified
2188255 western society is decadent and immoral and muslims should seek to bring it to an end if necessary by violent means
2188256 western society may not be perfect but muslims should live within it and not seek to bring it to an end
2188257 in brief europeans are lazy unwilling to fight for anything and willing to surrender to anyone they are fascinated by decadence they favor the bureaucracy over the corporation they are unable to assimilate their immigrants they no longer have children they no longer produce much of cultural or scientific significance they have lost their religious vocation and they no longer hold their lives to be meaningful
2188258 the electoral college should it stay or should it go
2188259 the only thing you have to fear is fear itself
2188260 in the long history of the world only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger i do not shrink from this responsibility i welcome it
2188261 my fellow americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
2188262 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
2188263 we have nothing to fear but fear itself encouraged the american people and contributed to the general hopeful attitude that allowed us to rebound from the great depression and fully enter into wwii in later years
2188264 yeah at first but its not that difficult i think that things could weve been louder and more intense that ay anyway you know speeches are all about mage and so is everyone it squit being um ok dumb if we do that then well truely have an amazing speakers day
2188265 ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country
2188266 who should i vote for i really do not care maybe i will vote for the guy who shows up on tv he has got cool ads and he seems chill
2188267 one afternoon near the end of the first summer when i went to the village to get a shoe from the cobblers i was seized and put into jail because as i have elsewhere related i did not pay a tax to or recognize the authority of the state which buys and sells men women and children like cattle at the door of its senate house
2188268 a person is smart people are dumb panicky dangerous animals and you know it
2188269 care how long my breaks are were not paying you
2188270 why would i want to buy a game where i have to do exercise
2188271 sure i want to play but im still a team player i want to go and win a super bowl thats a once in a lifetime opportunity im behind him and the team 100 percent
2188272 you kind of have that mentality of only watching but at the same time you have to be ready to play all the time
2188273 hopefully ill have a long career and plenty of opportunity to play im not real concerned with it right now i just try to stay focused on what my goals are and all my goals are still in view
2188274 the only worry for me is getting enough playing time to where you can transfer it over to the field
2188275 thats why the preseason is so important to me because thats my opportunity to get out there and play
2188276 i feel a lot better than at this time last season im very confident about tonight and the group im with looking to put some points on the board it was pretty rattling last year but at the same time once you get out there its just 22 guys playing football regardless of what the circumstances are i feel like i did pretty well but obviously i think i can do better things this year
2188277 thats what hes gonna do visit a doctor in arkansas yesterday again its a personal situation
2188278 i know shawn came out publicly and gave you guys a statement and thats what it is were working with him on it theres a personal side to things and youve got to take care of business and thats what hes doing right now its very important that he does that and gets that part of his life taken care of
2188279 hell be in there a little bit hell have an opportunity hell work in on certain plays with the ones theyre not plays that are designed for him but hell work in that group of players
2188280 right now im a defensive tackle ive got to go out there and ive got to play against the run and ive got to play against the pass and ive got to play special teams
2188281 thats what ive got to do every phase of the game thats what im ready to do i think everything needs work ive just got to go out there and do everything right now
2188282 the fade route was one thing we ran quite a bit in new mexico and we had a good feel for it
2188283 donovan was working on all the routes not just the fade route he wanted us to get better its been proven in camp with guys making plays left and right
2188284 he does many things well and that fade route is one of them
2188285 he also does multiple other things for us that most fans dont see we have ample weapons to create mismatches hank does some things inside for us we have some matchup situations that we may very well be able to take advantage of
2188286 that has been one of my focuses in camp going up and attacking the ball the way i used to
2188287 i dont know why but i stopped attacking the ball
2188288 hanks one we do have its something we worked on during the off season together and also did it out here hes been very good with it its something we could have used last year but we didnt its not a staple in the west coast offense but its something you can add in
2188289 we always change if something is wrong were going to fix it
2188290 you can never spend enough time with your quarterback its not just going out there and throwing the ball up he has to get used to whether im a jumper or not a lot of guys are quick and run under it that takes time hes pulled me aside and weve worked on that
2188291 its like a golf shot its your approach shot you want to get it close to the hole do you need to get under it put a little draw on the ball put a little backup on it it depends on the defenders some will let you get on the outside some you can post up like basketball and keep behind you but the biggest thing is put it up and then it comes down to us his job is put it up there for us and let us go get it
2188292 i have a feeling when the time is right well throw it a couple times this year
2188293 how can we generate enough cash from month to month to keep our business alive then have some money leftover to fund the sexy stuff
2188294 so do i need to do the blah stuff forever

2188403 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
2188404 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
2188405 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
2188406 he didnt give us pitches with a whole heck of a lot of the plate

2188411 the court also noted that even if the states election laws violated the associational rules of the party the party had the ability to define its own remedy
2188412 sullivans bill forces the idaho democratic party and other parties into compliance with party registration against their will by using the power of the secretary of state
2188413 i believe the u s supreme courts rulings demonstrate that sullivans bill is clearly unconstitutional
2188414 section 4 only persons who have registered as a republican prior to the primary election will be allowed to vote on an idaho republican party ballot in that primary election

2188424 just another example of bush policies helping the rich get richer
2188425 first bush cut taxes for the rich and the economy has rebounded with new record low unemployment rates which only means wealthy employers are getting even wealthier at the expense of the underpaid working class
2188426 despite the billions of dollars being spent in iraq our economy is still strong an d government tax revenues are at all time highs what this really means is that business is exploiting the war effort and working americans just to put money in their own pockets
2188427 only the rich benefit from these record highs working americans welfare recipients the unemployed and minorities are not sharing in these obscene record highs
2188428 there is no question these windfall profits and income created by the bush administration need to be taxed at 100 rate and those dollars redistributed to the poor and working class
2188429 profits from the stock market do not reward the hard work of our working class who by their hard work are responsible for generating these corporate profits that create stock market profits for the rich we in congress will need to address this issue to either tax these profits or to control the stock market to prevent this unearned income t o flow to the rich
2188430 that may be true but probably only 5 account for 90 of all these investment dollars
2188431 how much of this trickle down ever get to the unemployed and minorities in our county none and thats the tragedy of these stock market highs
2188432 we democrats are going to address this issue after the election when we take control of the congress we will return to the 60 to 80 tax rates on the rich and we will be able to take at least 30 of all current lower federal income tax tax payers off the roles and increase government income substantially we need to work toward the goal of equalizing income in our country and at the same time limiting the amount the rich can invest
2188433 we need to raise the standard of living of our poor unemployed and minorities for example we have an estimated
2188434 over the years the united states has sent many of its fine young men and women into great peril to fight for freedom beyond our borders the only amount of land we have ever asked for in return is enough to bury those that did not return
2188435 have you heard the latest dumb stunt bush has done he has sent an aircraft carrier to indonesia to help the tsunami victims what does he intend to do bomb them
2188436 our carriers have three hospitals on board that can treat several hundred people they are nuclear powered and can supply emergency electrical power to shore facilities they have three cafeterias with the capacity to feed 3 000 people three meals a day they can produce several thousand gallons of fresh water from sea water each day and they carry half a dozen helicopters for use in transporting victims and injured to and from their flight deck we have eleven such ships how many does france have

2188443 did you think that he was armed or a threat to you were you trying to act in self defense
2188444 where you told your team members that you thought the guy was a threat and that he reached for his weapon was that a true statement at the time

2188450 then i asked him since when does the army train you to shoot anybody in the head or in the face
2188451 i fired center mass into his chest they entered the upper left side of his chest a couple inches from his heart i knew that that would kill him
2188452 he turned out to be the man i wanted him to be he has honor he has integrity mike is my best friend
2188453 i have disgraced this uniform i have embarrassed my country
2188454 were pressured to give damning testimony against me and were given nine months in close quarters to get their stories straight they did it to save themselves and i am not sure how i feel about that they knew it wasnt murder they knew it was a war i am sad and angry and confused by their betrayal and lack of integrity

2188478 theres never trash talk that gets to your personal life or into your family players have problems off and on the field all the time but nobody comments on those things thats a real fight if you start doing that i wouldnt like it if somebody did it but i dont think it will happen
2188479 its a business on the field we play this game and its a sport but when it comes to personal matters you leave that stuff inside and we dont get into it i would hate to see what would happen if somebody did that because you could really push a guy over the edge

2188482 every instance of this kind of abuse is felt keenly by the army and deeply regretted but it would be a mistake to make radical changes to the armys essential organisation unless there was clear evidence that the faults we were seeking to rectify were endemic they were not

2188505 the incident which took place islamabad the once about the lal masjid came as a shocker to me
2188506 i think that its better that we do not share our opinions with any one about such situations because this may get us into a lot of trouble
2188507 i mean that if people start taking about the truth openly and this ends up in the local news paper so we would be getting tnto a lot of trouble
2188508 do u mean that people are afraid of saying the truth just because they may get into serious trouble if they do so because the people in power are going to create problems for them
2188509 consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of christ

2188511 coba kau baca apa yang pernah ayah tulis di dalam diary itu
2188512 hari ini aku di halaman bersama anakku yang genap berumur lima tahun
2188513 hari ini ayah baru bertanya kepadamu soal yang sama sebanyak
2188514 there are many compelling reasons to promote living organ donations since the demand is considerable
2188515 in reality the risk factor for a healthy donor is rather low
2188516 the actual risk of having a car accident is many many times greater than when flying yet more people have a fear of flying rather than a fear of driving
2188517 the chances of being killed by a bus are 10 times greater than from donating a kidney
2188518 a dialysis center is a very depressing place to visit
2188519 a typical dialysis regimen is three times a week with an average of four hours on the machine some persons require five and six hours some persons were awake mostly looking blankly into silent tv screens hanging from the ceiling and some were asleep at that moment the thought came to me these are the poor of yahweh and a further thought came why are most of these people here could it be that they have less access to kidney donations for any number of reasons
2188520 if i was willing to give her a lung before certainly i could give her a kidney now
2188521 i remember that it was the feast of st benedict and we had just finished doing a holy hour
2188522 as we were leaving the blessed sacrament father cioffi received a call on his cell phone
2188523 he then told me to sit down because he had something to tell me
2188524 i said father are you kidding you are a scientist and a priest how are you going to do this he explained that obviously he didnt have any family of his own to maintain and that he had already researched the matter on the internet reassuring me that everything was ok
2188525 now with my new kidney i will be driving soon and resuming my normal life again in gratitude i recently accepted a call from my pastor to be the pro life rep for my parish
2188526 i was kind of effectively wild they were chasing my fastball up so i kind of used that a lot
2188527 hes a young guy whos going to get better and better
2188528 for me being most effective i need to be aggressive
2188529 youre going to have those days when you feel a little rusty and a little off
2188530 those are the days youve got to work the hardest to get outs any way you can
2188531 those are the ones i threw right down the middle
2188532 some guys got base hits on not so good pitches but if you could take two back those were two bad mistakes in key situations

2188538 sympathy for the devil art and rock and roll since 1967
2188539 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit
2188540 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
2188541 essentially except for the character names and the relationship developed between the main characters played by defendant kevin costner and his daughter the entire concept of swing vote was taken from the copyrighted work
2188542 its sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew
2188543 i have salty tear marks on my face crying over an ex of one year i mean seriously how long does this fricking take he has a new gf on a flight to paris as we speak note we were supposed to go to paris together seeing pictures of them on facebook makes me want to vomit and so my question is why do i still care about him why does it make me sick to think of him being with another girl why am i so terrified of losing him or maybe the better question is why cant i face the fact that ive already lost him
2188544 i just dont understand where all the love is supposed to go when its all over
2188545 she had it all how do i find closure to the future that will now never happen but why force yourself to forget the harder we try the worse itll get and soon enough youll realize youre comparing everyone else to that person inch by inch and it becomes an endless cycle of eternal nostalgia
2188546 that cycle can be unhealthy and sabotage future relationships im no expert but sometimes we all have to realize our exes belong in the past cherish the good memories smile and move on
2188547 being able to avoid an ex is key to getting over the relationship
2188548 if you can justify why the breakup is necessary i think it makes it easier on the other person
2188549 life hands us whatever breakups we need for the evolution of our consciousness
2188550 i still find myself googling the boy i fell for the summer i turned sixteen and the man with whom i first fell in love summer 04 who is now engaged and the guy from high school who broke up with me in a coffee shop
2188551 i think of them and catalog in my mind all the scenarios that would lead to our reunion a visit home for christmas he walks into the party our eyes lock etc i think of them because they are at once completely familiar and unknown i knew them once and maybe loved them we were physically close emotionally linked driven crazy with chemistry yet i dont know those men anymore
2188552 when we do fall in love completely and without reservation all the dust that still swirls around the old flames will settle and the air will clear
2188553 there are more living organisms on the skin of a single human being than there are human beings on the surface of the earth
2188554 an important step toward reestablishing our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law
2188555 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
2188556 we made it very clear that these are enemy combatants
2188557 they do not and never have been given the rights that citizens of this country have
2188558 he saw the problems that were created in our international relationships whether law enforcement or intelligence cooperation or in the image of the united states certainly long before the bush administration did
2188559 its not just an aspirational goal its an action item sen mccain has said he will close it he hasnt couched it he said it will be closed
2188560 until a new administration has the ability to learn what we cant without the benefit of classified information about the nature of the detailed cases against each of these individuals it would be sort of foolish to speculate
2188561 those who are dangerous should be transferred to a secure military facility in the united states and brought to trial and swift justice
2188562 we have numerous facilities in both the military and civilian system including maximum security prisons like fort leavenworth that can be made to work once the decision is made to close guant namo
2188563 he will establish a fair and effective system for trying these detainees swiftly either in courts martial or u s criminal courts
2188564 with a stroke of a pen the administration could refer these to courts martial or u s district court
2188565 it would have to be done in such a way that the american public and international community would recognize why to ensure that any conviction or acquittal is legitimate
2188566 obama has been quite clear that he would do it either in u s district courts or court martial
2188567 if the day before the inauguration the case is given to the jury would president obama pull it out i dont know thats a hypothetical thats hard to answer
2188568 to make known the riches of the glory of his mystery
2188569 i was surfing the net and came across this really cool story press release on a vacation package addressing the
2188570 if you go to the great wall you are not a good man

2188588 sebaik baik shof bagi laki laki adalah yang paling depan sedangkan shof yang paling buruk adalah yang paling akhir sedangkan shof yang terbaik bagi wanita adalah paling belakang dan yang paling buruk adalah yang paling depan
2188589 luruskan shof shof kalian karena lurusnya shof termasuk kesempurnaan sholat
2188590 tidakkah orang yang mengangkat kepalanya mendahului imam merasa takut kalau alloh merubah kepalanya menjadi kepala keledai
2188591 sesungguhnya ubun ubun orang yang merunduk dan mengangkat kepalanya mendahului imam berada di dalam genggaman setan
2188592 sesungguhnya imam itu dijadikan untuk diikuti jika imam telah ruku maka ruku lah kalian dan jika imam bangkit maka bangkitlah kalian

2188594 italy greece russia 40 million a year yeah im there as simple as that
2188595 if it happens it happens id be surprised if it did with players of that caliber
2188596 but certainly we would deal with it if it happened and i continue to think that the nba will be the gold standard for the top players in the world for a long time to come
2188597 the more money they get the better they feel about the commitment

2188600 if ladainian got paid 25 million guaranteed in 2003 and now its 2008 the next person needs to be paid 30 million guaranteed
2188601 it works its way up you cant sit here and say im as good as ladainian right now and im getting paid five years after him so ill take 15 million that doesnt make any sense
2188602 i really cant go into details because to be honest i dont really know all the different rules in depth i know the titles to them but i dont know them very much in depth thats why i have an agent
2188603 i also know that there is a way that things can get worked out
2188604 through the research my agent has been able to do weve been talking to the nflpa and things like that i do know that there is a way that things can work it just comes down to whether its going to happen or not
2188605 it takes away from the fun when you cant go full out
2188606 you want to hit somebody who is not on your team you want to go as fast as you can to get to the ball and then and let it loose when you play the game and we cant
2188607 there are only so many plays the offense can run here and it kind of gets old after a while
2188608 you gotta lay off your own teammates and not hurt anybody
2188609 weve missed each others calls weve text messaged each other
2188610 its a situation that i think again you have to be very supportive of
2188611 its something that you just cant say im fine with it now im good hes seeking doctors hes talked to different people and ive always told him that if he just needs to talk or he just needs an ear im here
2188612 were thrilled to welcome these two beautiful animals to our family at the baghdad zoo
2188613 the conservartors centre is proud to contribute these tigers toward the restoration of the baghdad zoo and the important education work it will engage in over the next decade
2188614 after 13 days of the us occupation we found the animals in miserable conditions
2188615 only a few of the bigger animals were still alive such as four lions and three bears
2188616 we have forgotten this matter as it is in the past and the us apologised
2188617 we did not use to come here much but after we heard that there are new animals we wanted to look around especially for our kids
2188618 we really like the tigers and we hope they will bring more
2188619 we want to be able to see the animals alive like other children around the world we want to be happy like other children
2188620 wahai orang orang yang beriman taatilah alloh taatilah rosul nya dan pemimpin kalian
2188621 tidak ada ketaatan kepada siapa pun dalam maksiat kepada alloh ketaatan hanyalah dalam perkara yang baik menurut syariat
2188622 mereka jadikan orang orang alim dan rahib rahib pendta pendeta mereka sebagai tuhan selain alloh
2188623 bukankah mereka mengharamkan yang alloh halalkan kemudian kalian ikut mengharamkannya dan mereka menghalalkan yang alloh haramkan kemudian kalian ikut menghalalkannya
2188624 hujan batu dari langit akan segera menimpa kalian aku katakan rosululloh berkata demikian demikian namun kalian mengatakan abu bakar dan umar berkata demikian

2188638 we cant get to where we lose our cool out here its that time of year guys arent in very good moods out here well get rid of the extracurricular stuff it wasnt anything big a couple of little ones
2188639 we were anticipating it and we need that as a football team
2188640 after a while it kind of got excessive as far as the banging and guys trying us we needed that thats something were trying to build on our toughness and at the same time build on our mental toughness
2188641 i dont know if he didnt like it but i didnt like it
2188642 you dont know whats flying over and theres a lot of weird stuff going on in the world today it was kind of low and i had never seen a helicopter fly that low over the field
2188643 its important that he gets the help and he gets himself back here and ready to go
2188644 i thought it was important from the jump that shawn get help get himself where he feels comfortable get back and do what he loves to do
2188645 if you have your own opinion on a certain situation thats something i think that you keep to yourself but you have to understand that people go through things like this and if it was you how would you like to be received and how would you like people to kind of acknowledge you shawn as we know is going through some things right now and the only thing that you can do at this point is support him when he comes in just kind of welcome him and make sure that things are going to be ok
2188646 i think with that first group i want to see how stewart handles the situations im going to let him make a lot of calls maybe even in a 2 minute situation thats probably the first thing how he handles it like a continuation of last year
2188647 again i want to evaluate our nickel package as far as our defensive line using four defensive ends we did a little bit last year were going to do that a little bit more this year after that i want to look at guys who are trying to make this team and how that second and third group plays and see who makes plays and who shines
2188648 just that im obviously capable of handling the reins when were playing somebody other than ourselves
2188649 its only the department of defence that is big enough and has the federal mandate for the necessary scope of development
2188650 in shaffers words the federal government faces widespread criticism for failing to take significant action to slow climate change
2188651 every time the price of oil goes up 10 a barrel it costs the department of defence 1 3 billion a year
2188652 every time we have to send a convoy out to refuel tanks or deploy forward locations it puts peoples lives at risk

2188656 rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind
2188657 it was not that this man sinned or his parents but that the works of god might be displayed in him
2188658 do you think that these galileans were worse sinners than all the other galileans because they suffered in this way no i tell you but unless you repent you will all likewise perish or those eighteen on whom the tower in siloam fell and killed them do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in jerusalem no i tell you but unless you repent you will all likewise perish
2188659 that the works of god might be displayed in him
2188660 why would god show mercy to vessels of wrath prepared for destruction
2188661 behold i lay in zion a choice stone a precious cornerstone and he who believes in him will not be disappointed
2188662 the stone which the builders rejected this became the very cornerstone
2188663 certain persons have crept in unnoticed those who were long beforehand marked out for condemnation
2188664 if thats what god is like then i want nothing to do with him
2188665 i will only take god on my terms if he violates my terms i will not allow him in my life
2188666 porque si estamos haciendo lo que toca eso es lo que dios quiere
2188667 you will not be disappointed with voting yes seems like a no lose situation to me
2188668 its not enough that we do our best sometimes we have to do whats required
2188669 in just a few years ill be taking the little man to fundy with us
2188670 dad i already know im going to marry sally because after all she is my girlfriend
2188671 i mean i know she says that joe is her boyfriend but she can only have one boyfriend and that is going to be me joe will have to find another girlfriend
2188672 big d what if the lord doesnt want sally to be your wife
2188673 but dad suzie is only 4 and jane is too crazy and mary just isnt quite right joe can pick one of them but really dad sally is my girlfriend
2188674 dont you know what kind of cool stuff you could get for 3 29 your daddy wants you to have good things and wants to get all kinds of good things for you all you have to do is ask me
2188675 the life transforming power that those words have demonstrated in the life of the community of faith
2188676 when god who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased to reveal his son in me so that i might preach him among the gentiles
2188677 and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses
2188678 if somethings too hard its not worth doing like snowboarding or martial arts
2188679 a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do he may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall speak what you think now in hard words and to morrow speak what to morrow thinks in hard words again though it contradict every thing you said to day ah so you shall be sure to be misunderstood is it so bad then to be misunderstood pythagoras was misunderstood and socrates and jesus and luther and copernicus and galileo and newton and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh to be great is to be misunderstood
2188680 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
2188681 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
2188682 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
2188683 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
2188684 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
2188685 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
2188686 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
2188687 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
2188688 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
2188689 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
2188690 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
2188691 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
2188692 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
2188693 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
2188694 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
2188695 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
2188696 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
2188697 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
2188698 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
2188699 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
2188700 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
2188701 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
2188702 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
2188703 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
2188704 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
2188705 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
2188706 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
2188707 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
2188708 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
2188709 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
2188710 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
2188711 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
2188712 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
2188713 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
2188714 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
2188715 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
2188716 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
2188717 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
2188718 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
2188719 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
2188720 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
2188721 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
2188722 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
2188723 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
2188724 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
2188725 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
2188726 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
2188727 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
2188728 i want you to know it time for me to step up to the plate and be the kind of woman you deserve
2188729 i m going home to tell the jerk im seeing to get lost and i will see you tomorrow to start helping you get organized at home
2188730 well i like guys who are nice and are fun interesting to be with
2188731 to hell with the holy water sprinkler and the tuque
2188732 its the key to all abstract to the revolution that happened in the art world
2188733 it was momentous in the cultural history of quebec because it basically opened the doors to modernity
2188734 people had to go beyond quebecs borders to see the real world and join the international currents
2188735 you have to realize these people were artists they were struggling with financial difficulties as well as rejection from society
2188736 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair colour
2188737 we can confirm that the divorce is final they remain the best of friends and their family is obviously the priority
2188738 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
2188739 weve just got to get some guys back who are on the dl and maybe if we can add here and there i think we certainly have a chance id like to be a part of it thats great
2188740 we were just really lucky that no one else had hired him he was the right guy at the right time we never had any doubts that hed be back
2188741 cito is going to have a big hand in what kind of staff we have here
2188742 its important that hes comfortable with the staff i think bringing gene tenace and nick leyva here was important to him at that time well see how it goes
2188743 tapas is the name for a wide variety of appetizers in s
2188744 unfettered by the bonds of years and deaf to prayer untouched by tears each one departs
2188745 this way lie perils and that way safety you who roam searching for foreign shores with caution steer and you returning lo the land is near and yonder waits the harbor which is home
2188746 arise thine hour has sounded thou must go for they that earliest taste lifes holiest feast must early fast lest grown too bold they dare seize the share of them that follow
2188747 mid all who worshiped at my feet exalting me mid all who loved me best as i remember now i there beat no heart more fondly in a single breast no eyes that brightened quicker when i came no hand that lay more longingly in mine no voice that knew a tenderer tone to name my name than his whose love seemed half divine
2188748 i wait to pay my homage here where most t is owed
2188749 my paths are not all stormy there is calm upon my mountains and clear skies above this radiant land thou viewest bears my balm profounder far than thine
2188750 how those lilies grow that on the lakes breast seem to float apart and free though firmly fastened their roots below thus do i seem before the wind and tide of chance and change to sway from side to side but still my heart is anchored to her heart
2188751 there at the opening door i see a shimmer as of snow wings t is his white robe that as he passes flings its shining undulation oer the floor
2188752 late thou comes sister still thy lamps to trim thy clear voice failed us in the evening hymn wherewith the grace of heaven we supplicate
2188753 raul hit that ball so hard it didnt have time to go foul
2188754 you really dont realize until you are going around the bases whats going on
2188755 split finger just trying to put him away and i just hung it up there
2188756 part of the pregame meeting was dont let this guy beat you
2188757 but theres not a guy i dont think i can get out it stinks right now it definitely does but the sun will come up tomorrow
2188758 the way rauls swinging it seems like the situations finding him
2188759 right now the big situations are finding raul and hes delivering
2188760 its just going to be sore but thats all right
2188761 i got my mouth i got my teeth i got my tongue i got my chin i got my neck
2188762 its almost illegal how much fun were having on stage to be perfectly honest
2188763 its incredible everyone just loves each other and were truly like a tribe on and off the stage and we just go out there and have a blast and run out in the audience and throw our hair in peoples faces
2188764 the ultimate freedom to stand there and have no clothes on and be your true self
2188765 if there was any place to get naked it would certainly be in central park doing hair
2188766 so if i had the opportunity to i probably would the show is written so that claude is confused hes certainly not as free as everyone else is it would be wrong for him to get naked
2188767 i learned a lot about my role in spring awakening actually through doing hair because hair is so open and free with your body and lots of upbeat songs and lots of audience participation and spring awakening is so restricted and buttoned up and knickers and coats
2188768 this show has taught me so much about letting go and living moment to moment and enjoying where youre at when youre there and im really grateful for that
2188769 its really really really insane something is in the climate or the stars are aligning or something because its like all of this stuff from the late 60s keeps popping back up
2188770 hes talented and there he is working his butt off you know just so on it willing to try anything willing to do it again willing to rehearse more
2188771 never a moment of attitude from him about anything its just like kind of a deep place of something that hes working from a deep resource of energy and interest and its great because when you have someone like that it just spreads in the company
2188772 he loved the whole thing he had a blast his son was up on stage dancing with us after it was over it was really really fun
2188773 the real king that god makes is the man who melts all wills into his own
2188774 are you connected with the people who own the drugstore in st joe
2188775 i hope you were all listening ive never been more proud of cbs
2188776 we have come to the end of the day at whb owned and operated by cook paint amp varnish company
2188777 hasta la vista and see you tomorrow this is the kunsel trendy broadcorping castration
2188778 here i am speaking underwater from third street in cincinnati
2188779 im an announcer but im supposed to look after things
2188780 well while i was walking to the studio this morning i went down such and such a street and
2188781 well me and my girlfriend was in bed and she hit me with a lamp
2188782 well christmas is coming have you been bad this year
2188783 the guy who goes around in riding breeches and boots
2188784 god this was a no good son of a bitch and everybody is acting like his death is a great loss
2188785 oh what did i say about that lousy son of a bitch
2188786 chuck i want you to pick out someplace any place you want to go i want you to go there for six months all expenses paid and i dont want anything from you at all except the best goddamned half hour script ever written
2188787 all day all night upstairs downstairs is all around charlie
2188788 do you know anymore about this hollywood movie about eppy that sounds great but i hope they dont get it horribly wrong like overly nasty punk john pushy paul whos the only one that wants them in suits etc and the thing with brians personal life i hope they dont emphasise that especially the masochism also id hate to see them depicting brians homosexuality as the only reason he wanted to manage the beatles because that would be wrong im really anal about these things if they are going to do a film i hope the producers and director do their homework and dont try to appeal to the lcd
2188789 all those things that werent supposed to happen they happened what happens next is up to you

2188793 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2188794 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2188795 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
2188796 i try to always be positive about every single player on the roster
2188797 so im not even going to address that i will say that im very hopeful that lito will have a terrific season show us and the league that hes back to the old lito feels healthy has got great playmaking ability and certainly a lower ypa
2188798 if thats the best thing they can come up with to talk bad about me then that explains a lot about me
2188799 obviously i already know how they feel about me that was displayed way back when they brought asante samuel in and named him the left cornerback starter i know exactly how they feel so that is what it is
2188800 i think it would be a lot better if it was for somebody else
2188801 i dont know what is going to happen this is my job and a lot of people dont like their job but they still have to do it

2188840 i was reminded yesterday by robert kall director of the very good news website opednews com that he introduced me to muhammad about a year ago i think
2188841 muhammad wrote for peace and freedom a few opinion pieces from the tribal areas but as we exchanged messages we began to really work toward the same one goal freedom for the tribesmen of the tribal areas in pakistan
2188842 this has meant that muhammad and i have exchanged communications five or six times a week for about a year the few times that we have been out of contact more than say two or three days the other was left worried and wondering
2188843 i have been able to intervene in small ways on behalf of the tribesmen in the tribal areas but it is muhammad that is in harms way it is muhammad that lives in the tough country and does the tough jobs and it is muhammad who has had to bury friends lost in the conflict with the taliban and al qaeda
2188844 this is really the terror war this isnt reality tv this is reality after one of muhammads friends was killed he emailed me a photo of the mans children i wept
2188845 muhammad and i are both emotional he sends me messages of gratitude and thanks sometimes he is overly emotional but he is always a genuine man
2188846 we had a message of thanks from muhammad at peace and freedom
2188847 i sent back god is with you and blesses you good sir i am as nothing just a leaf blowing in the wind but it is you si r who are as the wind moving mountains in the tribal areas
2188848 i am off to the shops by myself for a change because i feel brave and aventurous today and think that warning of killer hippos on a rampage is not going to be of relevance to boringtown where i live with you my sister

2188850 i cant give you the exact number of casualties but most of them were believed killed
2188851 wild west where even the army of pakistan fears to tread
2188852 of course pakistan is a key u s ally in the war against terror
2188853 pakistan is our partner in the war on terror and captured several al qaeda leaders however it is also a major source of islamic extremism
2188854 eliminating the safe haven that the taliban and other extremists have found in pakistans tribal areas is not sufficient to end the insurgency in afghanistan but it is necessary
2188855 i think that musharraf is with us on al qaeda but i am afraid that al qaeda and other jihadists are also finding sanctuary in that part of the country
2188856 there is a very strong belief that osama bin laden and his deputy al zawahiri are both in hindu kush of pakistan they are not in afghanistan
2188857 absolutely there is growing american unease and i would certainly enlarge that to say there is a growing international unease with pakistan
2188858 hand over those linked to global terror groups who were a liability
2188859 now the question is are the pakistanis really protecting those guys
2188860 president musharraf has been a great ally there was prior to 9 11 a close relationship between the pakistan intelligence services and the taliban pakistan was one of only three nations that recognized diplomatically recognized the government of afghanistan at that particular time but the fact is musharraf has put his neck on the line in order to be effective in going after the extremist elements including al qaeda and including the taliban in pakistan there have been three attempts on his life two of those by al qaeda over the course of the last three years this is a man who has demonstrated great courage under very difficult political circumstances and has been a great ally for the united states
2188861 so theres no question in that area along the afghan pakistan border is something of a no mans land it has been for centuries its extraordinarily rough territory people there who move back and forth across the border they were smuggling goods before there was concern about about terrorism but we need to continue to work the problem musharraf just visited karzai in in kabul this past week theyre both going to be here during the course of the u n general assembly meetings over the course of the next few weeks we worked that area very hard and the paks have been great allies in that effort
2188862 pakistan weve gone in and worked closely with musharraf to take down al qaeda saudi arabia same thing in all of those cases its been a matter of getting the locals into the fight to prevail over al qaeda and al qaeda related tyrants
2188863 think of musharraf who puts his neck on the line every day he goes to work when thereve been attempts on his life because of his support for our position and they look over here and they see the united states thats made a commitment to the iraqis thats gone in and taken down the old regime worked to set up a democracy worked to set up security forces and all of a sudden we say its too tough were going home whats karzai going to think up in kabul is he going to have any confidence at all that he can trust the united states that in fact were there to get the job done what about musharraf or is musharraf and those people youre talking about who are on the fence in afghanistan and elsewhere going to say my gosh the united states hasnt got the stomach for the fight bin ladens right right the united states has lost its will and will not complete the mission and it will damage our capabilities and all of those other war fronts if you will in the global war on terror
2188864 upon my head these gathered tears bestow a great and softening grace it else would lack the crown of sorrow dear thy gift is best

2188870 i got away with some pitches tonight but overall i thought i threw well
2188871 i also know im capable of pitching badly and it can change in a heartbeat
2188872 its real pleasing to see the progress hes made his last two starts
2188873 hes going to have his ups and downs but he was consistent tonight
2188874 once we got them on we were able to get them in
2188875 he got the barrel out front and hit the homer but it wasnt that bad a pitch
2188876 they got the lead to six nothing and its hard coming back the last two innings
2188877 i felt like our at bats were even better early on today
2188878 we hit some line drives at some infielders throughout the game
2188879 after the first few swings today it looked like his normal swing and he was driving the ball out of the ballpark

2188884 better late than never i did a bit of voice coaching a couple of years ago after 35 years with no voice coaching a bit of voice coaching and warm ups really helps i always tell these younger singers i never used to do it either but you should a lot of people have voice problems not just older people younger people too i was speaking to joss stone and i mean you sing a lot every night you are singing for hours and hours and your voice gets tired like anything like running every night thats why you have to warm up properly i just learnt that so thats probably helped me

2188902 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2188903 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns

2188906 dr atkins weight was consistently and frequently documented in the years and months prior to his fall as he was suffering from cardiomyopathy his health was monitored closely due to water retention this robust 6 foot plus man who competitively played tennis frequently during the week had a weight that varied between 180 and 195 during his coma as he deteriorated and his major organs failed fluid retention and bloating dramatically distorted his body and left him at 258 pounds at the time of his death a documented weight gain of over 60 pounds
2188907 any implication that dr atkins was obese or fat prior to his coma shows a blatant disregard or even worse lack of understanding of the medical facts surrounding this case or of the physiology of severe heart failure and the degree of fluid retention that occurred during this hospitalization

2188990 a year ago the prevailing wisdom was that youd think the market would rally up to the beginning of it and then you get out

2189069 this valuable set of puritan writings only becomes available once every few decades when an adventuresome publisher decides to invest a great deal of time and money to offer this gift to christs church it has only been reprinted twice in the last 150 years not counting the current edition do not fail to obtain a copy of this set and think of giving one to your pastor as an act of gratitude for his faithfulness and then be a reader of these wonderful books not a collector only
2189070 while commenting upon the one hundred and nineteenth psalm i was brought into most intimate communion with thomas manton who has discoursed upon that marvellous portion of scripture with great fulness and power i have come to know him so well that i could choose him out from among a thousand divines if he were again to put on his portly form and display among modern men that countenance wherein was a great mixture of majesty and meekness his works occupy twenty two volumes in the modern reprint a mighty mountain of sound theology they mostly consist of sermons but what sermons for solid sensible instruction forcibly delivered they cannot be surpassed manton is not brilliant but he is always clear he is not oratorical but he is powerful he is not striking but he is deep there is not a poor discourse in the whole collection he is evenly good constantly excellent ministers who do not know manton need not wonder if they are themselves unknown
2189071 it only remains for me to express my earnest hope that this new edition of mantons works may prove acceptable to the public and meet with many purchasers and readers if any one wants to buy a good specimen of a puritan divine my advice unhesitatingly is let him buy manton we have fallen upon evil days both for thinking and reading sermons which contain thought and matter are increasingly rare the inexpressible shallownesss thinness and superficiality of many popular sermons in this day is something lamentable and appalling readers of real books appear to become fewer and fewer every year newspapers and magazines and periodicals seem to absorb the whole reading powers of the rising generation what it will all end in god only knows the prospect before us is sorrowful and humiliating in days like these i am thankful that the publishers of mantons works have boldly come forward to offer some real literary gold to the reading public i earnestly trust that they will meet with the success which they deserve if any recommendation of mine can help them in bringing out the writings of this admirable puritan in a new form i give it cheerfully and with all my heart

2189096 namibia south africa and angolas concerns are receiving attention the epas are to be signed at the end of this year but they affect the sovereignty of a state and will have quite an impact on the existing southern african customs union sacu and the envisaged larger customs union planned in a few years by the 14 member southern african development community sadc
2189097 the blame should be squarely placed at the doorstep of the eu
2189098 another concern for namibia is that the eu introduced a last minute and non negotiable clause the most favoured nation mfn clause into the text of the interim epa this means that should namibia in future hold trade negotiations with other countries that might offer better market access than the eu these better access conditions should automatically also apply to eu countries
2189099 the purpose of this booklet is to inform the broader public on the pros and cons of these future trade deals and the impact on developing countries including namibia in order to stimulate public debate

2189135 without industry how do you progress this is the general trend of all civilization from village to city from agriculture to industry you cannot stop it you should not stop it and for that you need private industry private capital you need big business we need multinationals

2189138 no we are not going to support the deployment of our troops to iraq they have to return to united states as soon as possible we are not going to approve the budget for the war neither is we going to approve more money for plan colombia without conditions we are not going to sign an fta with a government like the one in colombia which is a narco paramilitary government a corrupt government a government that has fought an endless war against colombians
2189139 if there is no internal conflict then why demand aid
2189140 from now on the best business for us is peace and as the business for us is peace then we are going to invest in it we are going to return part of what we have taken from poor colombians and invest it in peace
2189141 eventually time runs out if you dont start winning games

2189143 with the ball rattling around in the corner i dont know of any third base coach who would have held him up there
2189144 you have to make the decision right away sometimes you make the right one sometimes you make the wrong one
2189145 midway in the air i figured i had a chance
2189146 you see what happens and then you just go hard it was a great feeling not starting the game and coming in for defensive purposes and making a great play
2189147 i was really impressed with him tonight because this place plays small and they have a lot of power
2189148 javy was the no 2 guy for us the way he pitched last year and the expectations are going to get higher and higher from now on for everyone
2189149 the fish they should be biting good on a day like today
2189150 i really would prefer it to be like this in general especially on a lake where you are largemouth fishing and youve got clear water like this because theyre a lot more active in low light conditions
2189151 typically a lot of the time theyre going to do their feeding at night but theyre going to feed all day in stuff like this
2189152 ive had that focus for quite some time about this through the season this year
2189153 even as far back as oh say clarks hill i knew that was a stretch of the season where i had to turn things around and really start making things happen
2189154 i wasnt really having that good of a year overall i had a win in florida but i also had a couple of tough events too so i knew that i had to really step it up
2189155 if i had had 12 pounds yesterday it would have been huge i had that multiple times over and just couldnt get them in the boat
2189156 well go out there today and do the best we can and see what happens
2189157 im just glad going into this day that im still right there in the thick of things
2189158 i want to win this real bad but i almost you know hes such a good guy and such a humble person that it is tough to compete against him and feel good about trying to win
2189159 hes a very deserving guy and it would mean a ton to him too but trust me im going to be fishing hard
2189160 theres a lot on the line today the angler of the year race
2189161 at 3 oclock i only had one fish in the livewell
2189162 to end up catching a limit right there at the end i really feel like i salvaged my day and the possibility of angler of the year
2189163 actually the second fish i caught i was praying at that time so yeah the lord was looking after me
2189164 regardless of whether or not i win angler of the year ive had a great year and im very proud of that
2189165 whatever comes today whatever the lords will is im happy with that
2189166 its probably the most prestigious title in our sport right there with the bassmaster classic champion
2189167 it would mean a lot to me it would mean a lot to my sponsors and it would mean a lot to my family
2189168 were doing our own deal and its us against the fish and whoever catches them the best is going to win the title someone is going to have that title and crown
2189169 i have a lot of respect for kevin and look up to him and hes a great guy hes always right here at the end of the year and this is really my first legitimate shot at angler of the year title and i really hope i can conquer it
2189170 yesterday i fished deep the early part of the day and i felt like that was my best opportunity to catch a 15 to 17 pound bag
2189171 there was a big school of fish where i started at in practice that was pretty evident because there were two other guys who started on that same spot
2189172 but nobody caught them yesterday so i dont know if the fish werent there they werent biting or what
2189173 im definitely going to run my water a little different today
2189174 im going to start off shallow and put a limit together doing that and go from there
2189175 the deep fish when i found them it was tuesday and it was sunny and calm
2189176 those conditions are probably better for the deep bite i think you saw a lot of fish caught shallow yesterday with conditions like they were
2189177 i go to sleep thinking about it i wake up thinking about it and not only myself but my wife is strained thinking about it its definitely taking its toll on her
2189178 im sure that just like kevin is im ready for it to be over with
2189179 im ready to get this show on the road today and let the cards fall where they may
2189180 in the final analysis brian said i made a commitment to the padres three years ago that i would like to fulfill
2189181 we thoroughly discussed and analyzed and projected the next two or three years of his career
2189182 and took in every consideration and he made the decision that he made he has never made a decision based on what was best for him money wise he took a deal from the padres that was 6 million to 9 million less than what he could have gotten elsewhere the money factor had very little to do with his decision
2189183 i do not think it is healthy to think about what might happen
2189184 if you go through life thinking about death then you are probably not living life to the fullest
2189185 i am thrilled to be in a place ive never been that offers so much and on such a vast scale black lung disease being the exception

2189200 image is the key and what people think about you is more than what you are most of our efforts to save some nigerians before they were executed did not yield much result as most of them were executed just few days after our intervention

2189218 not less than 59 000 nigerians are currently in northern african countries without valid travel documents this number represented those who were in transit waiting for the opportunity to migrate to the west

2189220 information provided by our missions abroad indicated that apart from those held for simple immigration offences majority of those in prison are being held for drug related offences
2189221 reports had it that over 10 000 migrants have died between 1999 to 2002 while trying to cross over from north africa to europe the circumstances of their departure such as using unofficial routes and without proper documentation have made them vulnerable to criminal gangs
2189222 these gangs recruit them into all manner of illicit business with long jail sentences as consequences when they get caught
2189223 1 469 nigerians were in uk prisons six in afghanistan 15 in libya 20 in indonesian prison facing death sentences while one in south arabian prison was executed some days ago

2189230 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the marketplace

2189242 all the committees are 50 50 men and women so we are trying to challenge gender roles women should be allowed to speak but here in teso region women are downplayed by men we are trying big cultural change the government is trying to do this too so we are working with the government
2189243 local people are expected to contribute a small amount of money we have discussed at the sub county level and in the watsan committee they put the money into a common pot and it is held for the whole sub county empowerment is key to everything in this project

2189261 integration is going smoothly as a result of solid planning and execution the strategic drivers of the gemstar acquisition remain compelling and our pipeline for design wins and licensing opportunities are promising
2189262 it is not surprising given the widely publicized downturn in advertising markets that our non strategic media networks segment is performing below our original expectations additionally we determined that our emeta business is not core to our technology solutions strategy and have now classified it in discontinued operations
2189263 when considering the strength in the core technology solutions market segments consumer electronic and service provider offset by weakness in media networks and the elimination of emeta from continuing operations our current 2008 adjusted pro forma revenue expectations range between 600 million and 650 million and our current adjusted pro forma ebitda expectations range between 210 million and 240 million on a segment basis we currently estimate our 2008 technology solutions segments adjusted pro forma revenues will range between 425 million and 465 million excluding the media networks segment we currently expect adjusted pro forma ebitda to range from 180 million to 210 million for comparative purposes these 2008 adjusted pro forma estimates assume that our acquisition of gemstar and all of the synergies related thereto as well as our various dispositions were completed on january 1 2007
2189264 for apple to be vague and state bug fixes is not right what bugs which ones sometimes not all are fixed or even acknowledged
2189265 there have always been people willing to pay for the mac experience and ignore those who would tell them something else is just as good what youre seeing is an increase in the number of people who believe a mac is worth it some of us have felt that if more people would really try a mac theyd feel the same way and clearly its happening
2189266 os x is worth the 700 difference easy as near as i can tell unscientifically from talking to my pc using friends the 2 days month they spend dealing with windows bs compared to the two hours i spend each month dealing with os x bs yes theres some immediately pays for the difference within the first month if my time is worth 50 hour
2189267 macs other than the macpro are expensive for the hardware you get and arguably cheap for the software you get if you value the software and youre not out to buy the cheapest thing that will get you by then there is a value argument for macs on the other hand if you somehow need every possible gb of ram random access memory and hard drive and gpu graphics processing unit performance youll never beat a hand built windows or linux pc unless you factor in the cost of your time to select components do the assembly recover from the missteps etc
2189268 i think every pc company builds a quality product using quality components and often the same manufacturing partners
2189269 no one sets out to build a poor quality pc you build a product that supports the price point you target and provides the margins that your company needs to generate to be a successful enterprise apple hp dell no one builds a lower quality pc you cant sell defective memory or processors and hard drives are pretty much the same the difference is in the functionality which i think is a totally different concept than quality you can use more functional components that offer new features and have added costs which is mostly how we differentiate a 1 500 pc from a 500 one and not the build quality
2189270 photos rotate soon after iphone is tilted faster than 2 0
2189271 it is an industry standard to have a changelog or version history which lists all items changed and added
2189272 for example 1password a mac password manager just came out with an update take a look at its long list fixes to get the idea for apple to be vague and state bug fixes is not right what bugs which ones sometimes not all are fixed or even acknowledged a changelog helps users know what has in fact been changed
2189273 why apple choses not to reveal whats in its changes is really lending more to its over secrecy issue people say the bush administration is secretive sheesh apple is beyond ridiculous maybe apple doesnt want to reveal security issues it fixes and thus just doesnt note them
2189274 theres no reason to hide corrects app store update issue where iphone updates are not seen on itunes 7 7 x for example thats just plain silly
2189275 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
2189276 does anyone else think that this was really just a press release that was sent out in the form of a leaked internal email
2189277 good to hear they are taking this seriously but on the other side mobileme is actually a very good service people who think they can do better with free services must just not use the services the new push sync services are great photo sharing is top notch and general web publishing couldnt be easier but probably the single most valuable service for me and what makes everything else really work is the idisk
2189278 imo the macbooks and the macbook pros design is near perfect sleek no unnecessary fuss quality materials clever details what do you think could be optimized

2189281 its sic essential for the american people to know the facts about what is happening in iraq some media outlets and certain politicians still fail to assess the situation objectively so vets for freedom is heading back to iraq to let them know what has been accomplished what still needs to be done and how we should proceed in order to attain sustainable security in iraq
2189282 you can have your tiger woods weve got sen mccain
2189283 theres no broad statement that you can make that you cant have somebody who works with an organization involved in a campaign
2189284 if essentially you have reporters who are the founders and the activists in the organization then getting credentialed and going with preconceptions and then going out and campaigning thats highly questionable and that deserves scrutiny it seems to me that to some extent the question is is there any chance that any of them change their views or is it simply a kind of a fraud
2189285 apparently there is a way to do this programmatically along with some other interesting things like enabling window update display throttling but only if youre apple
2189286 all these webkit methods are undocumented and they appear in binary blobs shipped along with the webkit source
2189287 would any other apps like to take advantage of some of that functionality im pretty sure the answer there is yes but they cant
2189288 despite my frustrations with linux this type of hiding isnt really possible in a real open source environment
2189289 i dont think this is malicious its just an unfortunate cutting of corners that is way too easy for a company thats not fully open to do
2189290 many of the private methods that webkit uses are private for a reason either they expose internal structures that cant be depended on or they are part of something inside a framework that may not be fully formed
2189291 as you yourself blogged there was a totally acceptable public way of doing what you needed to do
2189292 for the past 30 years we have dismantled barriers opened doors and windows been dazzled by sunshine and felt the wind of profound change in the olympics we expect to witness new heights of effort and hope speed and strength that will inspire china to lift the pace of reform to be more determined more courageous and more at peace with ourselves

2189297 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2189298 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
2189299 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing

2189306 barack wants to focus on new technologies to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling
2189307 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
2189308 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detriot making hybrid and electric cars that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
2189309 im aware of what has happened and thats why i decided to cooperate
2189310 sella admitted taking a drug explaining the context in which it was taken
2189311 i am stepping down from the volunteer role i recently agreed to take on with the obama campaign as arab american and muslim american coordinator in order to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
2189312 we need muslim americans to get excited about the campaign and theres a lot to get excited about
2189313 and of course there are added sensitivities with our faith given the
2189314 confessed to having had access to a banned drug and he explained the context in which he received the substance

2189328 this is good news the experience the two players have gained overseas will give the whole team a good boost
2189329 i will be trying out at least three exciting players whom i think will add a new dimension to the future of the national team
2189330 it is games like these that we must utilise to give players game time and give the new faces a feel of international football in order to build on their exposure
2189331 for the next three months we are hoping to play such games to prepare for our participation in the caf african womens championships to be hosted by equatorial guinea in november
2189332 it is an important tournament for south africa because we finished third in the last edition in 2006 and nobody remembers third place finishers
2189333 this is also an important game because the netherlands are among the best in womens football in the world and have brought their full compliment of players it will be a good test of character for our girls
2189334 when i confronted her with that she pulled a knife and threatened to kill me thats when i made arrangements to get the kids out
2189335 but were not optimistic that were going to have him any time soon
2189336 we feel he is healthy and liked the fact that he has experience and has had success in the past
2189337 weve been looking for a lefthander for a long time and we think this lefthander can help us
2189338 its going to take some time still backs are tricky
2189339 he told me ill give you 100 for that ball
2189340 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the

2189345 but what people have to realize about miami is where in this world we are right now were trying to build this team preferably with young players that could maybe grow up together and by the time were finished we hope we have a pretty good product and that the maturing didnt take that long

2189356 i love your shops i always find what i need at them
2189357 why a naval operation before an actual town counsil has formed many shall ask i am sure allow me to explain there are many elements that need to be checked from the sea first before they can be irradicated from the land this being an island unto itself the precept of admiralty law and maritime law apply for the coastal waters of the island the concept of securing the surrounding sea is most important to this city however this should not be viewed as a blockade of any kind indeed it is meant to promote peaceful commerce in effect
2189358 i am not totally opposed to some of the pirating and privateering which continues undaunted yet there are certain activities such as the distribution of blackrock from our port and waters which must be detered
2189359 this is but a prelude to the sovereignty of a city counsil in which we shall participate by no means is this an event to threaten the citizens of moonglow nor is the mmn a guild but is established to created a unity for the island we are also working on setting alliances with the royal britanian guard navy and with port baldmore though we are unsure of the outcome of these negotiations at this time
2189360 weve asked the owners of privately owned vessels who are participating to prefix their vessel names with mmn to identify them as a significant part of the fleet im sure that changes in this manifest shall happen over time yet this is as it stands presently
2189361 this means more country people will be able to access specialist services without having to travel to perth

2189363 by taking the voices of passionate and inspired young australians to the un i want all world leaders to recognise the power of young people not just as leaders of tomorrow but as the leaders of today
2189364 young people have been essential in instigating key social movements in history from anti war movements to civil rights struggles
2189365 i want to learn more about the un and join the un youth group in australia because it could give me the chance to make a change in the world
2189366 the words were out of my mouth before i considered them before id thought them all i had the chance to do was feel them but i did that as hard as i could
2189367 when we look at global targets none of us believes that it will be 100 percent everywhere
2189368 but if you look at individual countries and if you look at the percent that have achieved universal coverage or will be close to universal coverage there may be much more than you may think of
2189369 what weve seen is that in a number of countries theyve already reached their universal access targets others not
2189370 in a word money with the cost of new drug development hovering in the hundreds of millions of dollars the pharmaceutical industry decided there wasnt enough of a market to make male hormonal contraceptives worthwhile
2189371 the biggest hurdle that ive encountered in trying to share this information is a sort of knee jerk reaction that men arent interested in these kinds of contraceptives and that women wont trust them to take them neither of those assertions are supported by the data

2189378 instantly the sky was blanked out by the incandescent white light of the monstrous fireball
2189379 in the city of approximately 255 000 more than half the population was instantly dead or incapicitated dead above 64 000 injured 72 000
2189380 of forty five hospitals only three were left standing only twenty eight out of 290 physicians in the city were unhurt and 126 of the 1 780 nurses
2189381 with all facilities virtually nonexistent the city was at the mercy of the flames and by two oclock in the afternoon the six islands of the city were a sea of fire
2189382 the door facing yamaguchi opened and five boys fifteen or sixteen years old came running out they were unclothed except for torn underpants and yamaguchi saw that theywere covered in blood
2189383 i had never seen such a horrifying sight as those five shivering boys blood was pouring in streams from deep cuts all over their bodies mingling with their perspiration and their skin was burned deep red like the color of cokked lobsters at first it seemed strangely that their burned and lacerated backs and chests were growing green grass then i saw that hundreds of blades of sharp grass had been driven deep into their flesh evidently by the force of the blast
2189384 there was not a house standing as far as i could see although i knew the city well it was actually difficult to find my way for al the familiar landmarks were gone and the streets i often walked were now buried in debris and ashes
2189385 hirata noticed with a shock that there wasnt a living being in sight
2189386 it was as if the people who had lived in this uncanny city had been reduced to ashes with their houses he said
2189387 the first was a little boy he recalls he was completely naked his skin was all peeled off as if he had been flayed and the nails were falling from the ends of his fingers his flesh was all deep red when i first saw him i wasnt sure if i was looking at a human being
2189388 there were numberless injured persons all around me lying on the ground some held down by fallen timbers all screaming and shouting for help
2189389 by killing a great great many in the present is related to logic claimed for the dropping of the two nuclear bombs on japan if the bombs could bring a stop to the war this would mean the saving of perhpas millions of lives so that the killing of some hundreds of thousands would be

2189396 mr silva at verisign said even though patches have been put in place this doesnt mean users can sit back and relax
2189397 the biggest gap in security rests between the keyboard and the back of the chair
2189398 the look and feel of a website is not what a consumer should trust they should trust the security behind that website and do simple things like use more secure passwords and change their password regularly
2189399 we have anticipated these flaws in dns for many years and we have basically engineered around them
2189400 its been overplayed in a sense i think it has served to confuse the consumer into believing there is somehow now a way to misdirect them to a wrong site
2189401 i have knocked on the doors of many of the accused been harangued by locals horrified at jersey being lazily painted as a sinister island of secrets spoken to tourism officials and still i am not sure what the truth is
2189402 an outspoken critic of what he sees as the islands tendency to brush awkward problems under the carpet
2189403 it is tempting to use the islands tax haven status as a metaphor for the locals ability to keep even the shadowiest of secrets
2189404 jersey is a small isolated island which encourages a wariness of outsiders i was surprised to see how many powerful figures share the same name

2189418 one of the worst things that parents do is set up an oppositional environment
2189419 parental control is such a negative phrase no kid wants to be controlled

2189424 the words that in his judgment the protagonists ought to have used
2189425 what seemed to thucydides appropriate in each situation while keeping as close as possible to the general gist of what was actually said
2189426 the property sector attracts a lot of attention when we talk about investment we talk about choices investors will certainly shift their funds into higher yielding investments
2189427 the bank deposit rates are low thats why they shift their investment into apartments
2189428 love the lord your god with all your heart with all your being with all your strength and with all your mind
2189429 in him were created all things in heaven and on earth the visible and the invisible
2189430 its just meat he was taking it to the abattoir
2189431 with the push of a button he will change what it means to be human
2189432 no im sorry did he say he was going to 16
2189433 its unfortunate but ben will handle this with the same resilience he has shown as a football player i know he is looking forward to the next chapter of his life whether it is playing football or pursuing a career in criminal justice
2189434 yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift thats why they call it the present
2189435 but hes a pretty resilient kid he was quite disappointed himself hes gone back to kenton ohio and is going to reassess his situation to see where he goes from here the things he has going for him are numerous were going to see if we can get him into a nfl training camp he wants to continue to play football that will be our first job at hand to see if we can get him into an nfl camp there was a lot of interest in him getting into some camps if that doesnt work out hes got a masters degree in criminal justice
2189436 the ncaa felt they had enough information to make the decision without ben they felt like they could make the decision without talking to ben
2189437 wake forest didnt have the contemporaneous medical documentation when ben was there
2189438 we had all the documentation from his treating physician when the injury occurred and the follow up surgeries he got to wake forest and the paper trail ended thats the problem follow up visits things like that theres nothing
2189439 the ncaa isnt disputing that there was an injury what theyre saying is that theres nothing to support that it kept him out of playing
2189440 he was upset he didnt have an opportunity to speak on his behalf but the ncaa has protocol and they feel like they had a decision they could make without ben i think that would have helped ben if he had a chance to say his side of the story but hes a resilient kid and hell bounce back
2189441 i think a lot of people felt down that hes gone now but we saw we have to step it up and start preparing for the season we cant let it kill us when they first said it i felt bad for him because im sure that was really tough in my head right then i knew i had to take a leadership role and get the team going you cant wait theres no more waiting we now know we have to pick it up now
2189442 youll see a much different tempo this year with the 40 second clock
2189443 with the clock being set after every play weve got to be ready to defend the ball or run our offense as soon as the ball is placed
2189444 the players had a lot of energy and i was pleased with what i saw on both sides of the ball we really grinded with the running game for the first time both offensively and defensively
2189445 we probably practice special teams more than the average team because of what a weapon it can be for us
2189446 we have two of the better kickers in the country so its to our tactical advantage to be strong on that side of the ball
2189447 what we gain is a regional partner that will help coaches get regional exposure
2189448 i want to say that we have guys who can step in and theyre going to take over where we left off
2189449 as the leading regional sports network in ohio fsn ohio is proud to be the exclusive regional cable home of the bearcats
2189450 uc bearcat fans will be given the inside access and in depth news and information on their teams that sports fans across the state have come to expect from fsn ohio
2189451 we got after it this summer and kelce isnt really a newcomer
2189452 he got some time last year but he gelled right in with the way we played he finishes hard
2189453 regardless of who the quarterback is the o line is the backbone of the team
2189454 its always important to have a strong o line were going to play with who we have if mauk gets that year back wed love to have him back if grutza gets it hell be ready to play regardless the o line will be ready to play no matter what
2189455 the way i understand it if you can still supply more information theyll keep looking at it liebig said
2189456 everything theyve asked me for ive gotten it in even when they denied me they asked for more information and i got that to them
2189457 why get them upset if theres still a chance he said
2189458 the old head in there is pat liebig stewart said
2189459 but if im not playing nose guard i dont need to be any bigger
2189460 the way i understand it if you can still supply more information theyll keep looking at it liebig said
2189461 everything theyve asked me for ive gotten it in even when they denied me they asked for more information and i got that to them
2189462 why get them upset if theres still a chance he said
2189463 the old head in there is pat liebig stewart said
2189464 on second and third and short youd better be able to make some first downs
2189465 youd better be above 70 percent efficient i told our defense that there are going to be some days where the drills are set up for one unit to be more successful than the other heres your job stay out of second and short and third and short
2189466 the best way i would describe them is experienced and really fast
2189467 we are faster as a unit than we were last year now we have to stay healthy and the right guys have to be on the field
2189468 weve decided on two or three players that were not going to grind them on back to back practices
2189469 four months post surgery on an achilles for daniels its impressive that hes even out here were not going to push our luck on that one
2189470 well evaluate the decision at the end of the week and see where we are we want to be careful with them because for the most part weve got a good sense and feel for what that rotation is going to be like a lot of those guys are going to play
2189471 hes a rock hes all muscle on muscle obviously hes losing a lot of water and those muscles that have no lubrication tend to lock up
2189472 that is a battle between gilyard and armon binns a great battle you saw today a little bit of that competitive spirit with both of those guys they both want to be in there one time one guy was supposed to come out and he wouldnt come out we like that
2189473 but keeping the perspective that was against the second group in there it wasnt the first group when he starts doing that against the first group then ill be excited
2189474 were going to do our best to schedule games so they dont conflict if that becomes unavoidable well handle those situations on a case by case basis
2189475 hugest thing thats happened to leadville since we discovered gold
2189476 the whole town is buzzing and we are way beyond excited
2189477 a race like this takes a lot of experience and endurance he has that so i guess hes the odds on favorite
2189478 i would reiterate that ill be happy if im top 5 i dont think im in it to win it as they say
2189479 i dont think lance does anything on a lark i think hell be prepared
2189480 i dont know how prepared floyd was last year what im saying is if we were equally prepared i just cant see where those guys wouldnt pummel me
2189481 dave wiens is super human hes just as fantastic on mountain bikes as lance armstrong is on road bikes
2189482 i dont know if i can beat wiens but im 100 percent sure i can beat carmichael
2189483 i will be home showered and probably three beers in by the time carmichael gets back
2189484 several significant events have driven public and industry interest in personal health records
2189485 there is a push by insurance companies and hospitals to have all your history on an electronic database vendors of hardware and software marketing companies government welcome this and private insurance companies who try to avoid paying so much for your medical care and especially lawyers looking for lawsuits most doctors resist this change
2189486 a large majority of patients say they want doctors to move to an all electronic format for medical records and prescriptions saying that by doing so the quality of care would improve and the healthcare system in general would become more streamlined and less fragmented
2189487 americans are so dissatisfied with their healthcare system that 82 percent of them think it should be rebuilt according to a new survey by the commonwealth fund similarly there was substantial public support for wider adoption of health information technology like computerized medical records and sharing information electronically with other doctors as a means of improving patient care
2189488 our local market seems to be buoyed by the prospect of a potential rate cut in september mr lewis said
2189489 if that happens it would be good for the equity markets
2189490 westpac gave out some very positive figures and the market liked it very reassuring for traders
2189491 we also saw continued strength in oil and gas producers including woodside petroleum which is not surprising considering we saw crude oil bounce off recent lows overnight
2189492 its still hanging around the us120 level it has edged down a bit but thats just part of the volatility of the market said victor shum an analyst with energy consultancy purvin and gertz in singapore
2189493 supply side issues will continue to oppose the price slide while the concerns over slackening us demand will weigh down on prices
2189494 overall the market remains at a crossroad market participants are torn between persistent fears over slowing energy demand and potentials for further supply disruptions
2189495 the btc pipeline outage could last up to five weeks that represents a significant disruption to non opec supply mr shum said referring to the organisation of petroleum exporting countries
2189496 getting more and more pressure from dollar strength and it doesnt seem reversible for now
2189497 we are not distracted by problems in our credit portfolio enabling us to focus on our strategic agenda chief executive gail kelly said
2189498 theyve not stepped on any landmines and the market is rewarding it with outperformance souls funds management bank analyst paul biddle said
2189499 its the safe teddy bear stock in the world of financials
2189500 i think st george is a dead dragon he said
2189501 good with total written off items at similar levels to the first half
2189502 scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
2189503 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2189504 i think everybodys a little excited heading in to jacksonville
2189505 for me itll be good just to get one game under my belt and then ill start to feel more comfortable
2189506 and as we go through the preseason we will start a different quarterback in a different game thats the plan right now were going to make sure that all of our guys have an opportunity to play with the first unit its an open competition for those guys and this will be the first opportunity for them
2189507 if they can sit in the stadium and get hammered why cant they sit out here and relax and watch the ballgame
2189508 ryan had the big body and the team had a short yardage package in for him
2189509 the rest of us are going to have to step it up
2189510 if investors have a significant level of fat in their budgets to cope with variable interest rates they will tend to go for variable loans given they feel interest rates have peaked
2189511 at the moment youre seeing the possibility of rate cuts come into focus
2189512 if you see the reserve bank follow through with rate cuts thats going to buoy the housing sector and also reduce the amount of people taking out fixed loans
2189513 the downside of fixed rates is when interest rates go down your rate is constant and youre stuck with higher repayments
2189514 hes like the pudgy guy who shows up at the company picnic everybody is laughing and then he walks away with all the trophies
2189515 its just real old and they havent kept it up ive heard stories about former mets manager art howe coming off a road trip and finding a rat a live rodent on his desk i remember us trying to catch a rat running around in the bullpen
2189516 obviously i was very thrilled i think the health care authority had a very difficult task in reviewing the application but ultimately realized the opportunity we have here
2189517 now we start the hard work we have to make the facility operational put the health care professionals in place and open the doors
2189518 that dollar amount is tied to renovations over a period of time
2189519 basically its whats known in the industry as psych proofing the facility
2189520 you have to make sure its a safe environment for everyone involved
2189521 a lot of those kids are being sent out of state because there simply arent beds in the state
2189522 we will be taking children with limited numbers of diagnoses
2189523 its just such a beautiful facility and this is such a much needed service
2189524 i just think we will be able to give the patients good quality care in a psychiatric nursing hospital
2189525 the board of directors of pch really has supported this project from the very beginning they always envisioned this as one of the opportunities for st lukes
2189526 were starting from scratch we have a nice facility its nestled into the hillside so itll be peaceful here and we just think this is a wonderful opportunity
2189527 we still hope we can get a veterans clinic at the facility we havent given up on that
2189528 i dont know i just kept going with what i had
2189529 he didnt give us pitches with a whole heck of a lot of the plate
2189530 mike is capable of doing that he bent but he didnt break
2189531 we would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time
2189532 there are many people in electorates like mine who are really doing it tough at the moment
2189533 if the reserve bank takes a view and takes a decision to cut rates they will be the very people the reserve bank has in mind
2189534 if they do not receive the full benefit of what the reserve bank has intended then in a way thats subverting what the reserve bank is trying to do through its monetary policy
2189535 the strongest indication i can give you is that we want to pass on an interest rate cut if funding costs allow
2189536 at the end of the day were a commercial organisation
2189537 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks he told reporters in beijing
2189538 working families and australian pensioners and carers are under financial pressure from rents from mortgages from all sorts of cost of living pressures and therefore if banks are not going to do the right thing then were trying to make it possible for customers to vote with their feet he said
2189539 we seized a pretty good quantity of drugs and probably a couple thousand dollars
2189540 its centrally located there are a lot of low income apartments
2189541 its hard to police because they can see people coming in all directions
2189542 a lot of times it takes a while and you really have to make it look like youre not doing anything in order to get the evidence and be able to make an arrest
2189543 they used to be 20 a pill but with gas prices theyve gone up to 30
2189544 it becomes a social pattern they share with friends and it becomes an epidemic
2189545 a lot of the drug dealers that come up to mercer county are also strongly linked to wyoming and mcdowell counties
2189546 we dont stop at knowing whos dealing the drugs we follow the money
2189547 what is six months and one day in order for my son to die
2189548 seven months down the road everybodys getting their life back together my life is still totally destroyed
2189549 whats this telling the kids on the street you dont like somebody you just kill them
2189550 he stood in that club for no reason and ordered my son to die
2189551 and there my sons laid out in the dirt in a graveyard
2189552 the niceties of the law the peculiarities of the evidence the difficulties of proving a criminal case beyond reasonable doubt and fragility of witnesses
2189553 mr goodson is the person who took mr flacks life
2189554 its amazing what a fair bit of softer data can do
2189555 the reserve bank has talked down interest rates quite a bit they made it clear in their statement thats what theyre going to do and thats been convincing for us
2189556 they want to see softer domestic demand but they want to see wages growth remain under control
2189557 there are tighter financial conditions and then theres a second round effect of falls in equity prices and a weaker housing outlook as well as higher oil prices
2189558 growth is going to slow and stay down well below potential for the next couple of years so we dont have any inflation problems
2189559 its a case of trying to avoid these downside risks to growth which appear to be there at the moment
2189560 high petrol prices the credit crunch and the reserve bank tightening has had a big dampening effect
2189561 we havent seen that rise in national income since the korean war of the 1950s
2189562 with the jobs market remaining quite resilient theres still risk to interest rates remaining at the level theyre at
2189563 these changes will enable anz to offer our customers some very competitive fixed rates it said
2189564 we would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time mr rowland told the committee
2189565 those sort term funding costs have moved from an average of 10 basis points over the official cash rate to earlier this year to 100 points to last week 60 to yesterday 20 mr rowland said
2189566 i got a couple of dogs and a granddaughter living with me now
2189567 i dont need no alligator i dont have a place for an alligator
2189568 as tambi n la fe si no tiene obras est completamente muerta
2189569 a couple of years ago when i was still a pastor i took a large step back from political activism and im more convinced today that doing so was a wise decision than ive ever been that doesnt mean im not still interested or dont have opinions it does mean that with a limited number of days in ones life i dont think spending a significant portion of them on politics is a wise choice considering the needs of this life and the things that will still matter in 1 000 years
2189570 i finally told him about a month before the election
2189571 the palestinians are not lifting a finger to stop terror or recognize israel as a jewish state
2189572 i see this summit as a continuation of one sided concessions
2189573 you dont need a weatherman to tell which way the wind blows
2189574 give thanks to the lord call on his name make known among the nations what he has done and proclaim that his name is exalted sing to the lord for he has done glorious things let this be known to all the world
2189575 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2189576 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2189577 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself
2189578 its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2189579 although the victimization continues i am stronger for the experience
2189580 the enviable fortune to work with some of the most beautiful women
2189581 our ancestors were probably designed to make some estimation of the possible pool of alternatives and some estimation of their own worth relative to the possibilities
2189582 leads to a lot of guys sitting at home alone with their fantasies of unobtainable supermodels stuck in a secret sorry state that makes them unable to access real love for real women

2189588 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument
2189589 our goal is to provide livable wage jobs once again back on that ramp in seattle
2189590 we had 485 union positions on that ramp this arbitration allows us to stake a claim back on that property
2189591 its absolutely huge for us and for all organized labor todays ruling solidifies the fact that there are job protections
2189592 clearly in this extremely difficult industry environment we wouldnt continue to outsource if we believed it was costing us more than performing the work ourselves
2189593 focus is on working with the union to determine if we can agree on a remedy
2189594 depending on the outcome the company can appeal the ruling in federal court
2189595 i cant tell you how many people across the state and the nation have come up to me and complained about this problem

2189600 we may begin seeing pretty soon big american cities with no daily newspaper
2189601 mint has a handful of american citizens in its newsroom including me
2189602 india is a fascinating country where history is being made in many respects so it is a fertile place for good journalism hopefully some of the non indian journalists will have a better understanding of india when they do go back
2189603 its not the tough job market that sent me there yet i decided to go to india because the promised experience just seems tremendous readership is skyrocketing as are profits the managing editor also said he really wants to strengthen the multimedia elements of the web site and theres money available to put into development
2189604 i have met foreigners working at the hindu mint gq the hindustan times and times of india
2189605 they all work on indian salaries dont speak the language and all seem to be having a ball since there are so many new publications opening up in india there is a lot of demand for native english speakers and people who can bring higher reporting standards to local papers
2189606 i pretty much stick only to big investigative stories on subjects that i choose and leave the daily reporting and feature pieces to other journalists i have noticed that some american media houses are pulling back their freelance budgets just try getting an assignment past the foreign desk at npr these days but i bet that freelancers in america are feeling the pinch much more than i am while living on the rupee
2189607 id like to see more freelancers move to india there are too many stories to cover and just not enough time to get to them all

2189617 you then stabbed her in the throat and twisted the knife
2189618 in this case there is a need to mark the laws disapproval of the conduct in question and to act as a warning to others not to engage in similar conduct
2189619 these cases make clear the special need for deterrence where the employees concerned are at a disadvantage and rely on minimum award entitlements such as is the case here with respect to the casual loading
2189620 i have not selected any hyundai a league players in this squad because the match falls just at the beginning of the new hyundai a league season
2189621 i am very appreciative of the generosity of the coaches in the hyundai a league earlier this year in letting players join the national team in the season but its important now when a new season starts that the hyundai a league can start with full strength squads

2189635 soupernatural rumford street l2 can be described as a soup salad and sandwich bar with not a hint of animal in sight and i have to say i am hooked
2189636 on the day i went in the menu changes a lot it seems for lunch there were 6 soups on offer 2 of which were vegan veggie there was also a choice of hot meals including a vegan veggie chilli and lasagne and quiche for ovo lacto veggies a choice of around a dozen salads on offer all vegan veggie except 2 sandwich wise there was a decent choice of breads and fillings there are cakes biscuits and cookies the breakfast menu seems to include croissant pain au chocolat danish patries toast bagels muffins greek breakfast and porridge drinks wise its the usual teas amp coffees soya milk available juices and water i thought the place was fine the guy who served me was very helpful me as a vegan veggie the atmo was fine and price wise it was pretty much what youd pay elsewhere but elsewhere is unlikely to be all vegetarian
2189637 the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about all dietary needs its only a small place with a seating area in the window a little like a breakfast bar however they more than make up for its size with the varied menu available its a very clean pleasant place and you can see all the food being prepared in front of you this place has become very popular with not just us lot but meat eaters too so i suggest you get in there fairly handy as all the most popular dishes will be gone

2189649 im not going to say there was no way in the world they could have done that

2189651 it was one of the last names i would have expected to see
2189652 all we told him was tell the truth and cooperate
2189653 ms grants alleged prior actions are totally irrelevant to this suit
2189654 nascar must obey the law and should focus its full attention on improving the discriminatory and hostile work environment to which employees are subject
2189655 clearly these revelations show that there are always at least two sides to every story

2189657 she has made many threats on my life and job she called my job up to six times attempting to slander my name and have me fired
2189658 you want him to be 20 0 but theres nothing that we can do its definitely frustrating sometimes not being able to hit behind him but its part of the game its not like were going out there not trying to hit and not trying to score runs it just happens to be working out that way right now
2189659 going out there i think with whats occurred i tend to put a little more pressure on myself just knowing that every run i give up really does mean something
2189660 you just have to minimize the damage there have been times when i havent been able to and there have been times i have unfortunately i guess it hasnt showed much where it really counts in wins and losses
2189661 you just have to hit when it counts and thats when you have a runner on
2189662 thats where you have to improve dont get me wrong you have to hit to get on but you definitely have to be a much better hitter with runners on in order to be a good offensive team anaheim for example nobody is having career years but they get runners on and they just rake thats where they do their damage with runners on
2189663 were inconsistent but at the same time were still in first place
2189664 and to me were still two games ahead in the loss column and thats what counts what can we do about it we come out tomorrow and win tomorrows game

2189672 the european parliament chief said thursday that the eu is prepared to broker israel syria peace talks
2189673 the french president took credit for getting israeli and arab leaders to sit together in the same room
2189674 it was an extraordinary gamble to bring together in the same room all the countries of europe and the mediterranean
2189675 it was an extraordinary concept to imagine the arab states represented at the highest level sitting in the same room as the israeli prime minister
2189676 the financial results for the quarter were severe due to our rapidly changing business environment
2189677 companies are turning to virtual offices and landscapes as tools for employees and business partners to collaborate and learn
2189678 the power of virtual worlds is that they trick your brain into thinking youre actually sharing a physical space with other people participating in a shared activity as a result conversations and collaboration are richer people whod remain silent in a conference call webex or chat room will speak up in a meeting in a virtual world using qwaq you can bring in documents such as powerpoint presentations videos microsoft word documents spreadsheets and more and you can discuss the documents and collaborate on changing them you can do the same with 3 d objects created with just about any popular 3 d design and drawing software you can create freehand diagrams on a shared whiteboard and discuss those diagrams

2189685 we are consistently working with regulators toward a comprehensive solution for all auction rate securities investors

2189688 sort of the delta airplane hub of the west in terms of migration
2189689 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2189690 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2189691 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2189692 obviously were disappointed not to have been at the top but as a brand we consistently rank high in many many quality studies
2189693 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
2189694 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs
2189695 in todays environment the only concern i have with prius right now is meeting expectations with availability
2189696 in the last year significant changes have been made in the way the new chrysler llc works on improving quality and customer satisfaction
2189697 those changes have already had a significant impact the cars we are selling today are greatly improved
2189698 as our third quarter results illustrate difficult operating conditions in the homebuilding industry persist

2189708 intelligent students are much less likely to accept orthodox beliefs and rather less likely to have pro religious attitudes
2189709 the keener minds came to reject the religious theory of nature as inadequate religion regarded as an explanation of nature is replaced by science
2189710 greater intellectual maturity might be expected to increase scepticism in matters of religion
2189711 they seek to compensate their lack of physical control by appealing to the metaphysical powers that seem to control the world worship is seen as a way to influence ones fate and it is easier to accept ones helplessness if one knows the outcome is in the hands of an omnipotent being whose benevolence can be won by following rigid and predictable rules of contact one reason for the decline in traditional religious beliefs in industrial societies is that an increasing sense of technological control over nature diminishes the need for reliance on supernatural powers
2189712 why if the car industry spends 4 5 on research why does the mining resources industry spend only 0
2189713 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants

2189721 people would look at this house and say this is artistic
2189722 these people are unusual active and dont fuss too much
2189723 we stepped up a notch at celtic on wednesday night
2189724 i asked the players for a performance and they delivered i wanted to see us take the game to the opposition more and i think that i saw that
2189725 we will always keep the ball well and circulate it well but i thought we were quite dynamic at times
2189726 we broke quickly and that is something we want to introduce into the side
2189727 what has struck me with the group when i started working with them is that we have some blistering pace and if we can incorporate that into the side then we are a real threat to the opposition
2189728 our goal at celtic showed its value because when we broke we did so with pace and power and that augurs well
2189729 kelvin is a young player still learning the position but he has real pace and promise
2189730 i liked a lot of what i saw from players in midweek because we also pressured the opposition well in their own half and played much of the game in their territory that is what i wanted us to do and what i want to see again tomorrow against milan
2189731 it is another big test for us and is the right game and the right quality of opposition at the right time we have to re inforce what we are trying to do
2189732 i think milan will bring a strong squad they are preparing for a very important season themselves so i think they will see this game at our stadium as a good one to bring them on
2189733 they have some exceptionally gifted players and they will be here to do a job as well
2189734 milan lost heavily to chelsea in their last game and that was a result that surprised me you dont often see them lose 5 0 on the back of that we are the next in line so we had better watch out
2189735 in a way i hope theres a backlash because we want a competitive game some pre season games dont have a lot of contact in them and are not games that prepare you in the correct way but i anticipate that this one will be very different i am looking forward to saturday
2189736 it has been a very impressive pre season programme for us we have competitive games mixed in with games against some very high quality opponents and they should get us into great shape

2189744 it was a good solid day i got off to a good start at the first hole chipped it in for birdie
2189745 my emotions werent exactly on the happy side so it was important that i made a birdie at the second hole and steadied the ship
2189746 every part of my game was really good apart from the first hole i hit some great shots through the closing holes
2189747 civilization is a movement and not a condition a voyage and not a harbor
2189748 we truly appreciate the generosity of individuals and organizations that continue to contribute to our adopt a platoon care packages

2189755 its not an excuse for a building that most people in the district i represent would oppose
2189756 im encouraged department of education officials finally seem to be recognizing the desperate need for a middle school
2189757 now they need to engage in a serious conversation about where is best to put it
2189758 we think the building is a win win for everybody
2189759 i find it hard to believe that people can be opposed to this project
2189760 well look at pockets of overcrowding and pockets of need
2189761 at this time we believe putting a middle school in the dock st project is the most financially advantageous option for the city
2189762 my feeling is if somebody were to come up with an alternative to the dock st project i think the community would be very happy
2189763 were in a fix so you start to feel these are the only people who are going to do something for our kids and provide a decent middle school
2189764 she took sharon by the shoulders and pushed her out of the way sharon stumbled
2189765 she was demanding that attention be given to her immediately
2189766 sharon was attacked by someone in the community who supposedly represents a higher degree of human decency
2189767 victoria osteen never attacked her never tried to get in the cockpit
2189768 the aggressor and the person who was out of control who flipped out was ms brown
2189769 they will say this is about money but that is the only remedy a jury can offer
2189770 in the future our homes will not only be the place we lay our heads but our pillows could even know if we need medical attention
2189771 but at the decision point he elected to unlawfully kill a person in his control this is not a gray area its black and white

2189775 yes i do rant on at times about the whole privacy of health data issue as there is so much fear mongering ill informed ill logical pronouncements and just mis information that it makes me want to scream of course there is also the nearly weekly reports of this healthcare institution or that blowing it with regards to security and inadvertently releasing stolen or just mis managed consumer health data

2189777 i dont know if it was a release of emotion or it just was everybodys chance to get some free shots in on me i think guys were taking advantage of giving me some rib shots and some jabs

2189779 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well

2189782 deshalb ist es mir auch so wichtig was den fr hen spracherwerb anbelangt deutlich zu machen dass es um einen ersten spracherwerb von 200 bis 300 worten geht
2189783 ich kann immer nur wieder auf den aspekt der 200 bis 300 worte hinweisen

2189786 we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor
2189787 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea

2189791 they are all neck and neck with each other so i cant say i am leaning in one direction but those are the four i am really looking hard at
2189792 if i am not already dead set on another school by then
2189793 they just dont have that tradition at tight end that im looking for sorry to say
2189794 in the end we both have to do what is best for ourself
2189795 jim brown whos that couldnt have been good if i didnt see him play
2189796 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2189797 generally the banks that have done relatively well in maintaining profitability are not pure play investment banks
2189798 our conservative funding structure and our position as one of the worlds best capitalized banks remain competitive advantages
2189799 it means we will become self sufficient as a tribe
2189800 i wont need no more federal dollars i wont need no more state dollars
2189801 people have to realize this is one of the poorest counties in the whole nation

2189806 we were capturing a lot of carbon dioxide at levels much greater than other systems marshes and forests grasslands
2189807 they can just sit back and watch the tules grow and they should be making money
2189808 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
2189809 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow

2189818 they delivered two to the house across the street and its been vacant since last october
2189819 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2189820 this find will open up an area of paleontological research in the area
2189821 it is sensational to discover a near complete skeleton like this is unique in romania and a rarity in the world
2189822 it is important because it can give us complete information about the flora and fauna or the era
2189823 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2189824 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2189825 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2189826 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2189827 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2189828 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
2189829 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2189830 science is a wonderful thing but it is at the end of the day a tool
2189831 there was always the lingering question as to whether you would ever really be able to find differences that would be useful in terms of doing attribution
2189832 finding that you could really apply many of the same parallels with human forensics to microbial forensics
2189833 my recommendation would clearly be to not wait until something happens again because it may not be with anthrax
2189834 theyve got a heavy lift to convince the scientific world theyve nailed it
2189835 if they were engineered by dr ivins its highly unlikely that they would pop up anywhere else
2189836 their case hinges on the fact that these strains came out of this particular flask
2189837 these were conservative investors thats why they bought these securities
2189838 in a short period of time about 38 000 individual small business and charitable organization s will receive nearly 7 5 billion in liquidity

2189849 we did it to support our political choices but the other part was to provide a reasonable place for people
2189850 theres been lots of press coverage about places going for thousands of dollars a night
2189851 we made money as hosts and they saved money as guests staying in downtown san francisco for 80 a night and thats unheard of
2189852 but they also got to experience san francisco through our eyes as locals which highly contrasts with the experience of a hotel
2189853 i figured the guests would be delegates or serious activists so i felt it was a safe bet
2189854 a number of months sooner than we committed to the fcc
2189855 its so inspiring for a person being around them they dive into everything with open arms willing to support each other

2189869 for some time what i wanted was for manchester to have agreed to my transfer to madrid
2189870 i flew to portugal a few weeks ago to clear the air he has also spoken to some of the players
2189871 the boy has been going through some troubled times in terms of the approaches from the people in spain but once he knew my stance he then settled down and he gave the interview tonight which we are all pleased about
2189872 it is very positive and we will welcome him back here this week
2189873 ferguson listened to my arguments i listened to his and we agreed that it would be best for both parties for me to continue
2189874 this why i can affirm that i will play for manchester during the next season
2189875 before there are rumors and speculation that i will be upset i want to make one thing clear anyone who says or writes such a thing will be lying
2189876 i will be playing for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight for and honor my jersey with the same dedication i have always shown
2189877 hes never had a complaint about manchester united hes always been treated properly
2189878 i have a great relationship with the boy the players have a great relationship with him and i think that we can for now put this to bed now
2189879 i think the fans have got to understand that a young boy can be tempted by all this money
2189880 his father died when he was a young man and hes had to look after his mother sister and brother
2189881 they cannot be blamed because it was i who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid
2189882 we have won many games just on our fielding alone
2189883 are other teams getting better yes i think thats good for cricket
2189884 to beat us they started to understand that they need all three facets of the game not just bowling and batting
2189885 we work a lot on the throwing and the catching and the basic fundamentals but just tweak little things and sometimes its just good to have a different word or a different voice saying the same thing
2189886 obviously batting and bowling necessarily so is the priority of the game but these days with twenty20 cricket the game is evolving so quick you really have to have the well rounded athlete in all aspects

2189900 ar 4 and have to serve him even after finish your work late in the clients office
2189901 reasonable assurance as to whether the accounts are free from material misstatement

2189904 he doesnt have any allusions about being the key to the vikings success this season
2189905 its all anybody talks about hes the weak link stuff like that you know that old dan reeves line never let em see you sweat thats what he does a great job of
2189906 it kind of gave me some perspective on tarvaris donovan was still a work in progress at that point as far as the throws he was making and wasnt making
2189907 playing quarterback is just an evolution name me somebody who was great right out of the gate dan marino went to the big game right away but peyton manning threw 28 interceptions his first year who was great in their second year not many
2189908 hes not a roller coaster rider he locked his jaw at the end of the season and said this is what i need to get better at and he set out to do that youre talking about a kid who was here in the beginning of march when he didnt have to be he came in on saturdays in the offseason to work with his position coach thats unheard of so he wants to be good thats half the battle
2189909 im able to go through my reads faster im able to recognize coverages faster and different matchups i just feel a lot better than i did last year
2189910 im still a young guy and im still going to make some young guy mistakes but i feel a lot more comfortable out there than i did a year ago last year i was just trying not to make mistakes this year im still trying to avoid mistakes but im also trying to make plays and be aggressive
2189911 weve got to be able to beat one on one coverage on the outside bernard berrian who was acquired in the offseason will help us with that sidney rice an 07 second rounder who caught 31 passes as a rookie will help us with that now that hes a year two guy i like what ive seen in camp from tight end visanthe shiancoe an 07 free agent signing last year he was somewhat lost system wise but i dont see the wheels grinding anymore so all of those things should help
2189912 the biggest difference i see in him is his confidence
2189913 hes much more comfortable at the position i saw it in the otas it just seemed like he knew where to go with the ball in the presnap as opposed to dropping back and kind of figuring it out then

2189922 a single system which is composed of several interacting parts that contribute to the basic function and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning
2189923 this issue can actually be attacked quantitatively using simple principles of mathematical probability the problem is simply whether a complex system in which many components function unitedly together and in which each component is uniquely necessary to the efficient functioning of the whole could ever arise by random processes
2189924 this strong proscriptive claim that natural causes can only transmit csi but never originate it i call the law of conservation of information
2189925 natural selection produces or uncovers previously unseen combinations of genes that have always been there and remain unchanged if evolution were true it certainly would produce a change in the ratio of the types of genes which were present because it would be adding new genetic information which previously did not exist but the converse of this is not necessarily true you can change the gene frequency or the ratio of the genes that are already present as much as you like but unless you add new genes you wont get evolution evolution if it were to occur would require the creation of completely new genetic information

2189932 the problem with you politically correct folks is that you just cant conceive of anyone coming up with valid new ways of challenging politically correct ideas like darwinism and official holocaust history
2189933 or you think that an idea that is not in a peer reviewed journal cannot possibly have any validity
2189934 and you go running to the courts for rulings that criticisms of evolution are religious and not scientific just because they are not in peer reviewed journals
2189935 see cells are complex and we dont know everything about all its intricacies so it must be designed
2189936 but typical law journals are not peer reviewed or even faculty reviewed theyre student reviewed

2189953 the interconnectedness of web 2 0 applications stresses things that might not have been big problems in isolation but have become huge problems when theyre all tied together
2189954 not seeing features on the roadmap that are needed to secure these apps
2189955 were moving towards web based software software that runs in the browser and thats a really insecure device
2189956 and as it gets larger the problems are only going to get worse
2189957 the attacker can forcibly install google gadgets they can read the victims search history once a malicious gadget has been installed in some specific circumstances they can attack other google gadgets they can
2189958 really the sky is the limit once the browser is under the control of an attacker and that point is exacerbated by the fact that people trust google be a trustworthy domain making the attacks even easier
2189959 these users are almost all using javascript and normal web browsers making them easing pickings for many different classes of attack he added
2189960 while the business impact from google gadget malware is minimal at this time
2189961 i think there isnt that many quality strikers in the league
2189962 i think when i was playing in the nsl there were players like ante milicic damian mori bobby despotovski and we had adrian cervinski
2189963 every good striker had a good team they were scoring goals
2189964 i just feel they had better strikers back then than what there is now
2189965 the a league is so pumped up now that all the young players play a couple of games and their managers send them overseas

2189975 im 46 years old and ive been playing since i was four and ive never made a hole in one and ive made a lot of money playing golf

2189978 for one of these pint size guys to make contact with a driver and hit it 150 yards
2189979 if i use the analogy of mtv twenty five years ago or even apple five years ago those are two ecosystems in which companies who do not invest in creating recorded music have derived the majority of the value created in that ecosystem
2189980 that i think is the state we are currently in with activision and harmonix owned by mtv where the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
2189981 ben came over last week and told me im having another baby

2189992 the only known existing box score from the prospect showdown
