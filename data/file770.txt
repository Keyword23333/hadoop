7700003 the task seemed daunting not only would the illinois senator land me square in the center of rough and tumble presidential politics but his campaign was truly historic
7700004 you raised a lot of eyebrows on this trip saying even knowing what you know now you still would not have supported the surge people may be scratching their heads and saying why
7700005 far more americans say john mccain would be a good commander in chief than obama
7700006 hes always been one to rise to the occasion but this was about more than that
7700007 this was his way to maybe help quell a mini revolt among the delegates he likes barack obama and hes worried about the clinton factor hes now going to be the story of this convention at least until obama gives his acceptance speech and this should completely silence whatever dissension exists
7700008 may have accomplished more in the senate than some presidents did in the white house
7700009 i think this is his final hurrah to the party his final gift to the party
7700010 hes the last link to that promising new frontier generation of the 1960s when the world seemed pliable when we were going to make the world a better place when we were going to battle poverty and racism and fight for peace

7700078 its something that matters a lot to the palestinian people
7700079 making wrong decisions is worse than making no decisions at all
7700080 why are we releasing terrorists including some with blood on their hands
7700081 these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches

7700089 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted this is a serious warning a warning to all and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts within this context
7700090 are the protectors of the strategic strait of hormuz waterway and consider security in this vital waterway important for the country itself and other nations in the region
7700091 such actions severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7700092 whatever game plan mugabe had has been complicated and this greatly diminishes his capacity to form a cabinet and govern
7700093 mugabe is seriously weakened and he and zanu pf will have to take the negotiations more seriously
7700094 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition
7700095 well shit ive got a way to go hes like 80 years old
7700096 if the auto industry is doing bad everyone is doing bad its like everythings on hold
7700097 at first it was supposed to start last april then it was supposed to start in august now its supposed to be starting in october they keep on pushing it back so until i see it
7700098 the slowdown in housing starts has been very painful for the industry but it is the necessary medicine to work down the inventory of unsold homes
7700099 we need for sales to outpace production so we can work down these inventories thats what has to happen before we can get this thing back on track
7700100 we know the moment you find something thats more suitable to your needs youre gone
7700101 barack obama may be one of the first people to inspire others the way john f kennedy did and robert f kennedy did
7700102 there was another time when another young candidate was running for president and challenging america to cross a new frontier
7700103 he faced criticism from the preceding democratic president who was widely respected in the party
7700104 and john kennedy replied the world is changing the old ways will not do it is time for a new generation of leadership
7700105 has really been in the forefront of protecting reproductive freedom education reform minimum wage and civil rights
7700106 at least if hillary clinton was the nominee you could show that picture again
7700107 the clintons are on the 60s side of the baby boom generation
7700108 many of the people watching this convention were not born 40 years ago they see obama as one of the first politicians theyve known to be so inspiring
7700109 so when they hear how senator kennedy was a mentor it will mean something
7700110 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

7700113 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7700114 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7700115 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7700116 i cant comment on went wrong at this time if anything went wrong at all
7700117 the escapees are more of a threat right now than how they did it or how they got up to the roof
7700118 for more on this when those systems kick in gold and silver can drop in price even on days when inflation is reported to be high as happened aug 14
7700119 widespread damage to property and possibly in loss of life
7700120 it would cause such embarrassment to yourself in parliament both at question time and in debate confederation forced on the people under duress the navy used to see it through are possibly typical of the unfounded charges that might be made
7700121 i need hardly say that we could not invoke aid from canada in the circumstances
7700122 i dont know if it would have changed the final result
7700123 it would have depended on what point in the campaign the news came out and pro confederation leader joey smallwood was a brilliant counter spin operator
7700124 gordon macdonald has already spoken with you on the matter set out below the governor feels that there is a real danger of civil disorders there
7700125 we cannot ignore the possibility of disorders and that as we shall still be responsible for the preservation of law and order in the island we must take such precautionary measures as are possible we have of course no military garrison there which could be unobtrusively strengthened the best perhaps indeed the only course seems to be to have a warship in the neighbourhood which could in case of need be sent in to st johns
7700126 if only because the safety of the governor and the commissioners of government may come into question
7700127 i need hardly say that we could not invoke aid from canada in the circumstances
7700128 this question has been mentioned to the british prime minister and that it has his approval
7700129 the whole matter has to be kept a top secret
7700130 i consider it essential that additional force should be made available at not more than two hours notice preferably less and ask that naval vessel capable of landing two hundred armed ratings sailors or marines may accordingly be immediately place at my disposal it would not repeat not be desirable that such vessel should enter st johns harbour or be seen in the neighbourhood but there would be no repeat no political objection to its sheltering if necessary in placentia bay or conception bay
7700131 the decision to send the telegram was associated with the march on government house at eleven oclock on the night of friday the 10th of december but it also had regard to rumours that certain elements would resort to rioting in an attempt to prevent the finalizing of confederation
7700132 so far nothing has happened needless to state i should much prefer to have the decision of the people carried out without the presence of a naval vessel in newfoundland waters moreover it would cause such embarrassment to yourself in parliament both at question time and in debate
7700133 on the other hand rioting beyond the powers of the police a force of some 160 could result in serious and widespread damage to property and possibly in loss of life should such circumstances arise a naval vessel as far away as bermuda would be of little use
7700134 the threat of deploying decisive forces drawn from the royal navy to quell what would certainly be represented as a manifestation of frustrated public opinion might well inflame the situation rather than provide a peaceful solution
7700135 you mentioned to me recently that the prime minister was not altogether happy about the way matters had been left as the result of mr correspondence with the first lord over the question of naval support in the event of an emergency in newfoundland
7700136 there is no very great risk of a serious disturbance in st johns
7700137 it is of course impossible either for the governor or us to guarantee that there will be no such disturbance but we feel that such risk as may be involved owing to the absence of any warship within less than six days steaming time from newfoundland will have to be accepted we think that the governor realizes this
7700138 the objection that most newfoundland anti confederate voters had at the time was not on joining canada but how the process was done
7700139 there is one other matter i feel i ought to mention namely that as the r n v r liaison officer at st johns is himself a rabid and most active anti confederate you may consider advising the naval commander in chief concerned that any communications relative to the matter of this dispatch should be addressed directly to myself
7700140 this officer is i understand a local solicitor by the name of furlong
7700141 his security guards were armed with brass knuckles blackjacks chains and some strategic advice from labour leader irving fogwill broken heads make for bad press while a hearty squeeze of the testicles induces political moderation without a fuss
7700142 but for the herculean efforts of the police who were aided by several clergymen the mob undoubtedly would have killed the prime minister
7700143 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7700144 it is fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7700145 some people have said it is as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal with in the 1970s
7700146 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7700147 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7700148 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7700149 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7700150 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7700151 killed himself as a result of depression which was caused by stress from the superiors insulting remarks and actions
7700152 the superiors actions were intended to defame the sailor and led to the excessive accumulation of psychological burdens on him
7700153 it was beyond something that can be called an instruction
7700154 you are not qualified to be a petty officer third class
7700155 i believe many other sdf members are in a situation similar to my sons
7700156 to avoid repeating similar incidents the government should not take the ruling to the supreme court
7700157 it is the first court ruling that recognizes the governments violation of its obligation of ensuring security for national public servants over their psychological burdens
7700158 the superiors remarks and actions were within the scope of an instruction and the sailor killed himself because of mental fatigue as his frustration mounted against his own slow progress in training

7700190 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music

7700192 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7700193 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7700374 het laatste rkk jeugdprogramma stamde alweer uit 1996 de tsjechische animatie asaf de herdersjongen
7700375 sindsdien waren er wel plannen voor jeugdtelevisie maar de bal ging echt het rollen toen begin september een aantal nederlandse bisschoppen bij de kro op werkbezoek was toen kwam tijdens een presentatie het kro jeugdbeleid aan de orde met de daarbij horende vijf waarden familie vriendschap en samenwerking spiritualiteit leren en vaardigheden en expressie
7700376 daar liet ik ook de kleuterdocumentaire dag oma zien een eigen productie over een meisje dat op allerzielen naar het graf van haar oma gaat de eerste reactie van het gezelschap was verbaasd dat je al die waarden in twee neenhalve minuut kan stoppen bisschop wiertz binnen de nederlandse bisschoppenconferentie verantwoordelijk voor de rkk zendtijd was zelfs zo enthousiast dat hij de volgende dag meteen opbelde omdat hij het op de europese bisschoppenconferentie wilde laten zien als voorbeeld voor katholieke jeugd tv
7700377 het zijn filmpjes die op een mooie manier de kerstgedachte voor kinderen uitbeelden zonder dat het meteen zwaar moralistisch wordt bij het filmpje kan god voetballen worden de levensvragen van kinderen mooi zichtbaar doordat ze teruggezet worden in de tijd
7700378 bovendien zijn de stukjes tussendoor over de levende kerststallen natuurlijk heel informatief voor katholieke families die zoiets een leuk idee vinden voor een uitstapje in de kerstvakantie
7700379 maar we moeten toch aan onze leden laten zien dat de bezuinigingen ons persoonlijk ook raken
7700380 wij kunnen onze missie straks niet meer uitvoeren we zijn een katholieke omroep maar door geldgebrek zal de kwaliteit van radio en televisie verdwijnen
7700381 daarom komen we nu voor het eerst in onze loopbaan in actie en de tweede kamer zal ge mponeerd zijn
7700382 ze is zelf moeder en heeft me verteld dat haar kinderen naar kros kindertijd kijken hoe kan ze daar dan op gaan bezuinigen
7700383 de kleine programmas zijn de klos een programma zal pas op de buis verschijnen als van tevoren vaststaat dat het een succes zal worden daarmee gaat het niveau achteruit
7700384 met deze speciale jeugdprogrammas willen we kinderen van nu impliciet iets meegeven van tradities en rituelen in deze belangrijke periode van het jaar waarden als familie en spiritualiteit zijn hierbij van groot belang
7700385 youri en de nieuwe club is in de kerstvakantie te zien in kros tien plus op zapp en zal via de ebu ook in tien andere landen op televisie komen geplaatst door webmaster om 19 01
7700386 bij ons gaat het niet om de presentatoren de ouders of de maker kinderen inspireren kinderen en die boodschap komt heel duidelijk over in programmas als deksels en onze kleuterdocumentaires in het buitenland is dat ongekend de internationale manier is heel traditioneel je hebt een presentator en daar bedenk je een programma omheen
7700387 er waren veel faciliteiten en dat had ik niet verwacht
7700388 we hebben onze film de boom met de gouden appels bekeken die voor de gelegenheid in het spaans vertaald was en geanalyseerd deksels een programma waarin kleuters zelf aan de slag gaan in de keuken zonder dat er een ouder aan te pas komt kwam ook aan bod de reacties waren heel enthousiast jan willem de studenten stelden veel vragen en hadden zich duidelijk goed voorbereid ik heb ook van hen kunnen leren omdat ze je dwingen om bepaalde keuzes goed te motiveren
7700389 in het filmpje zien we twee jongetjes in de keuken een omelet bakken ter ere van vaders thuiskomst tijdens het koken zie je geen enkele ouder en dat is echt ondenkbaar in de japanse cultuur die erg top down is van ouder naar kind leuk dat we ze met programmas als deksels en de kleuterdocumentaires hebben kunnen inspireren
7700390 het verheugt ons dat het niet alleen de doelgroep is die graag naar deze programmas op tv kijkt ook de internationale jurys waarderen de programmas uit kros kindertijd en daar zijn we uiteraard trots op aldus jan willem bult hoofd kro jeugd
7700391 vanaf september zal kros tien plus niet meer op zaterdagavond uitzenden maar uitsluitend op de weekend ochtenden te zien zijn om te bepalen hoe zon ochtend er idealiter uit moet zien leggen we nu aan de kijkers een aantal nieuwe idee n voor de kro is er per slot van rekening niet alleen v r de kijkers we zijn ook v n de kijkers
7700392 net als in de vormgeving van ons blok voor oudere kinderen kros tien plus staan nu ook in de vormgeving van kros kindertijd de kinderen centraal de programmaleaders en de korte filmpjes die voorafgaan aan de programma onderdelen laten kinderen uit de nederlandse multiculturele samenleving zien die door middel van samenwerking verder komen e n van de vijf waarden die je in alle kro jeugdprogrammas tegenkomt
7700393 hoewel kros kindertijd niet valt onder de noodzakelijke veranderingen binnen zappelin en zapp willen we dat kros kindertijd altijd midden in de wereld van de kinderen blijft staan en als die wereld van kinderen verandert veranderen wij met ze mee
7700394 azi en afrika deden de laatste paar jaar al mee maar met de komst van zuid amerika dit jaar heb ik echt het gevoel gekregen dat we de wereld omvatten
7700395 op dit moment zijn er besprekingen gaande met de arabische landen die ook interesse hebben om zich aan te sluiten
7700396 ik ben er heel erg trots op dat dit jaar al een eerste serie van 13 afleveringen is gerealiseerd er waren naast onze eigen inbreng ook documentaires uit denemarken en uit sloveni en volgend jaar doen ook noorwegen en engeland mee en er is ook bij andere landen veel belangstelling
7700397 zonder uitwisselingen en coproducties zou er in veel landen zelfs helemaal geen kindertelevisie zijn
7700398 de bezuinigingen in het afgelopen en komende jaar grijpen hard in we willen voorkomen alleen maar goedkope soaps en kwisjes op de publieke omroep te laten zien en zoeken daarom al jaren de internationale samenwerking zo konden we een paar jaar geleden samen met de scandinavische omroepen het kleutermagazine nu is nu coproduceren zijn er al veel items en animaties te zien in kros kindertijd en coproduceren we deze zomer in noorwegen een nieuw spelprogramma dat levert zappelin veel kwaliteit en financi le voordelen op en onze hoofdtaak is voor ontwikkeling te zorgen
7700399 kinderen worden op deze manier niet alleen ge nformeerd over de nieuwste films waar ze naartoe kunnen gaan maar leren er ook over praten en kritische consumenten te worden hun mening telt ze zijn in feite de eerste kinder f lmrecensenten op televisie
7700400 tijdens het maken van films als kruimeltje en pietje bell merk je hoezeer kinderen zijn ge nteresseerd in alles wat met film te maken heeft
7700401 what i will remember from the japan prize 2004 is the balance between the professional organization and the warm and inspirational atmosphere i have met so many professional and dedicated people from so many parts of the world it has been a great inspiration to my work tht usually develops within europe alone i became also deeply impressed by the quality of the research and programs of nhk a festival like this could not be in a better environment than nhk for me being responsible for public childrens television it was a new experience to be able to see not only childrens programs and to be able to exchange with people from other areas of television but with common educational goals and watching all those important programs and interesting presentations developed many emotions i believe today we are in a crossover between education and entertainment at the japan prize 2004 i have had a unique opportunity to meet creators and educators at the same time i am convinced that together we will find new solutions for education by television no matter how circumstances around us will change

7700403 de serie wordt internationaal geroemd omdat het een brug slaat tussen klassieke educatieve televisie en entertainment vandaar bijvoorbeeld de selecties voor japan en basel waarvoor traditioneel uitsluitend schooltelevisie programmas worden geselecteerd
7700404 de educatie in onze jeugdprogrammas bestaat eruit dat kinderen elkaar inspireren op soms onbekende terreinen zoals koken
7700405 ik ben blij dat ze spraakwater zullen vertonen dit is een volledige kro productie en daar kunnen we trots op zijn maar ik verwacht geen nominatie omdat het eigenlijk niet in de goede categorie zit deksels is een co productie van de kro met erik van schaaik en wendo kroon de japanse reacties op de vernieuwende kindertelevisie van deksels waren al heel positief en er was al een special over op de japanse tv ik reken eigenlijk wel een beetje op een nominatie
7700406 in alles wat we maken stellen we het kind centraal we gaan uit van de kracht van het kind en proberen dat te stimuleren bijvoorbeeld door een vijfjarige te laten zien die alleen met twee grote zwarte honden uitgaat of een kleuter die met een vlijmscherp mes sushis maakt heel vooruitstrevend
7700407 je moet dit natuurlijk alleen met kinderen doen dit dit echt kunnen en als andere kinderen iets willen proberen en er z lf om vragen moeten ze juist gestimuleerd worden
7700408 we zijn blij te zien dat we er als kro in slagen om wat toe te voegen aan de kindertelevisie in het algemeen en die van de publieke omroep in het bijzonder dankzij de pluriformiteit van het bestel kunnen we sterk uiteenlopende programmas maken vanuit verschillende identiteiten en dat dat werkt blijkt wel uit de vele prijzen die we de laatste jaren winnen de kro programmas vallen goed in de smaak omdat daarin zoveel ruimte en nadruk ligt op de kinderen zelf
7700409 van nature kijken vooral jonge kinderen naar een kinderzender als zappelin om ook de oudere kinderen te trekken hebben we het afgelopen seizoen het nieuwe ochtendblok kros tien plus gestart en daarin alle programmas voor oudere kinderen samengebracht op een voor hen veel beter tijdstip het is dan ook logisch om het drama dat voorheen in kros pubertijd werd uitgezonden hier naartoe te verplaatsen
7700410 kleuters willen zich in de hedendaagse kleutertelevisie kunnen herkennen door de krachten te bundelen willen we bereiken dat kleutertelevisie in de hele wereld volwassen kan worden
7700411 kindertelevisie moet leuk zijn dat is heel erg belangrijk als het niet leuk is kijkt er geen kind heel simpel not teleac maakt prachtige educatieve programmas waar kinderen op school naar kijken en dingen van leren als ze thuis komen willen ze wat anders wat niet wil zeggen dat er in kindertelevisie geen informatie mag zitten klokhuis is bijvoorbeeld heel informatief maar op een leuke manier sesamstraat ook kleine kinderen leren op een heel luchtige manier tellen bij oudere kinderen hoef je dat niet te proberen die denken meteen o jee nu ben ik wat aan het leren dat doe ik op school wel thuis kijken ze voor de ontspanning en natuurlijk willen wij bij villa achterwerk graag dat kinderen er wat van opsteken dat ze verrast en geprikkeld worden en dat ze wat te kletsen hebben daar hebben we hele gedachtes over maar het m et vooral leuk zijn
7700412 door de komst van commerci le zenders is amusement belangrijker geworden daarnaast verwachten kinderen van nu een hoge mate van entertainment in hun toch al enorm brede mediapakket mijn totaalgevoel is dat programmas vooral leuk moeten zijn maar wel ergens over moeten gaan zigzag bijvoorbeeld dat is informatief maar het zit in een entertainment jasje dat is heel goed gelukt we hebben er pas de prix de jeunesse prestigieuze internationale televisieprijs red voor gekregen
7700413 kinderen moeten zich erin kunnen herkennen ze willen niet alleen verassing en avontuur maar ook alledaags realisme de gewone dingen van het leven waarin ze zichzelf kunnen zijn en wij zijn daar gespecialiseerd in
7700414 fun is erg belangrijk wij wijzen nooit met een belerend en tuttig vingertje kinderen zijn thuis ze zijn vrij dan moet het leuk zijn op school krijgen ze al genoeg informatie ik vind wel dat iedereen die kindertelevisie maakt zijn verantwoordelijkheid moet nemen dus geen geweld en enge dingen van die verantwoordelijkheid zijn wij ons terdege bewust wij realiseren ons dat veel televisie kijken niet goed is voor kinderen daarom proberen we ze te motiveren om buiten te spelen veel te sporten en te bewegen dat doen we door series uit te zenden waarin kinderen dit doen daarbij staat de fun weer centraal wij willen televisie maken waar kinderen blij en gelukkig van worden
7700415 for 08 00 to 08 30 on saturday mornings we have decided to focus on shortform animation 7 to 12 this will allow us to operate like a carousel with rapidly changing programming to attract children as they surf between competing channels
7700416 animation that has worked well for us in this slot during the past year includes france animations titeuf a strong french comic book character this has helped us compete with shows such as nicks rocketpower with our market share rising from 15 up to 20 in this timeslot 08 00 saturday there are 72 episodes of titeuf available this fits our carousel strategy with a variety of short form ywt long running shows
7700417 we want to air shows including characters that kids really relate to playing to their securities and insecurities i bvelieve shows like rugrats do this succesfully by presenting the world from the point of view of children themselves including the threats and challenges that they face
7700418 it is also our strategy for 08 30 to 09 00 saturday and sunday to follow up the animation carousel with a live action magazine variety show currently zig zag produced by kro this for 9 12 year olds it includes an element of competing for prizes and covers topical issues for kids we want to feature younger presenters and characters moving away from 25 30 year old presenters that kids dont relate to virtual hosts could be interesting for the future as wel as they get around this age problem
7700419 childrens television is prehistoric as far as formats go it will catch up but its time programme developers started focussing on magazine formats with an element of infotainment that can be coproduced internationally for example our spotlight magazine show had previously worked well on saturday morning on nederland 3 and we later succesfully co produced this with zdf for the german market
7700420 jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this martha answered and said unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world
7700421 all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
7700422 judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
7700423 the gays are coming the gays are coming no pun intended
7700424 flee fornication every sin that a man does is outside of his body but he that commits fornication sins against his own body what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband
7700425 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god
7700426 but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
7700427 het is niet zo vanzelfsprekend dat je kinderen op straat ziet spelen in istanbul omdat kinderen vaak binnen zitten
7700428 met deze uitzendingen willen we kinderen in nederland en turkije even een beetje dichter bij elkaar brengen
7700429 het is heel moeilijk om de doelgroep van 10 15 jarigen te bereiken als je een speelfilm voor hen in de bioscoop uitbrengt in nederland ontbreekt daarvoor het benodigde marketingbudget in de bioscoop is de film helaas ook geen succes geworden maar dit is na uruguay en duitsland al de derde keer dat een kinderjury de film bekroont en een beter bewijs dat het arend steenbergen is gelukt om bij hun een gevoelige snaar te raken is er niet

7700436 de ebu item uitwisseling mag met recht de meest intensieve en succesvolle televisie samenwerking ter wereld genoemd worden het stelt landen in staat om kindertelevisie de aandacht te geven die het verdient en maakt het mogelijk om kinderen in nederland te verbinden met kinderen in de rest van de wereld op deze manier inspireren ze elkaar in drie jaar tijd is de kwaliteit en de hoeveelheid korte kleuterprogrammas bijna verdrievoudigd en in brazili is het ons zelfs gelukt het allereerste kleutermagazine ooit in zuid amerika gemaakt tot stand te brengen komende zomer proberen we datzelfde te bereiken in colombia want in dat land waar kinderen dagelijks ruim zes uur televisie kijken en dat vaak de enige educatie is is kleutertelevisie cruciaal bij de opbouw van dat door oorlog verscheurde land
7700437 i noticed that there was no preschool television except sesame street in holland and sesame street is eighties television its an american point of view and holland is much more developed country it has more philosophies on children and a very much more liberal kind of mindset i thought we should find something specific for holland and for me that was to develop a philosophy on children based on the belief of the autonomy of children
7700438 nederland 1 between 17 00 and 18 00 is the number one channel in the netherlands at the moment
7700439 we already have educational television and we already have straightforward entertainment so for me it became education by inspiration
7700440 ive tried to find stories that come out of children especially in the preschool documentaries that we produce
7700441 if you cook you have to do this this and this the cook is doing it and the children watch it
7700442 every day i want to have live action series with preschool kids i want to have a drama series with preschool kids and i want to have a preschool documentary and around that i will put different kind of animation so by the end i have a great compilation of genres different kids of storytelling but most of all i have experiences through the screen children inspire children
7700443 if a child has the remote control they go from channel to channel until they find an animation when theres no animation they will go on until they find an adult acting like a fool an overacting adult if thats not on they will stop at kids kids are interested in kids
7700444 im working for childrens television and this the only department in the world where you have all the genres on the table
7700445 in my country it put preschool drama on the map
7700446 tippe featured real dialogue between four and six year olds it works its real drama showing that on television was huge its impact is enormous kids hadnt seen anything like that before
7700447 we work in the same format so we can exchange content
7700448 documentary is not a genre for children if you make it verbal children up to 12 are very driven by what they see our documentaries are very much based on what the child sees and are without narration or at least with few words we are interested in showing important moments in a childs life
7700449 the traditional way of looking at children is that you have an empty barrel and we have to put knowledge in and skills in
7700450 i say no we have a kid who is full of this knowledge and skills and we have to get it to come out in the programmes we select
7700451 realistic preschool animation series about the beauty of everyday life and a touch of spirituality with a five year old as the main character i already have something similar in zdfs lauras star
7700452 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7700453 to add friend finding capabilities to select current and future garmin gps devices

7700455 i got up close to read the small text at the bottom

7700457 aq is not the only extremist ideology of interest or concern domestically or overseas but countering the aq threat is a counterterrorism priority and requires aq centric communications efforts
7700458 it the narrative combines fact fiction emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues the narrative is simple flexible and infinitely accommodating it can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on understanding and interpretation of local or global events
7700459 the objective is not to dismiss grievances but undermine aqs position as their champion and violent extremism as the solution
7700460 our first tailored product with key arguments exposing the theme aq is losing support
7700461 this series of guidance alone will not fatally undermine the aq narrative but it can increase our impact against the narrative while we develop a bespoke and hard hitting campaign using private sector resources
7700462 we are in negotiations with several major communications companies to design and deliver high impact campaigns across media and non media channels
7700463 push these message themes to a wide range of contacts
7700464 if it looks too much like government propaganda then i dont think people are going to listen nor should they
7700465 they called me saddam hussain and osama bin laden we just wanted to get away get home but they attacked and we couldnt get away
7700466 i blame myself for not saving mohammed but where i come from we are not used to this kind of thing happening at home we never need to defend ourselves like that
7700467 after i asked them to leave i noticed a police car pull up outside i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left less than an hour later mohammed who was like a brother to everyone here had been beaten the attack was completely unprovoked and without reason
7700468 what parent will want to send their children here when they know things like this are happening
7700469 we are all deeply shocked at whats happened mohammed was everyones friend we cannot believe something like this could happen we will never come back here
7700470 the young man was a visitor to hastings and his death is tragic our thoughts are with his family
7700471 then cory booker of newark attacked teachers unions specifically and there was
7700472 that flies in the face of just about every other number ive seen in this race and i think mason dixon had a bad night
7700473 this poll is so far off the mark i cant even respond to it
7700474 i defy anybody to say what are the rights of a citizen if they do not include the control of his own diet in relation to his own health
7700475 the timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity other than concessions and smiles
7700476 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7700477 came from a set of experiences that come from a life of living overseas having family overseas being able to see the world through the eyes of people outside our borders
7700478 if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it
7700479 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of these countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
7700480 poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to its neighbors
7700481 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destructions this is a guy who has destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
7700482 so you will now say i hear the voice of an aclu member dennis do you think that this guy should have shot these people spray painting graffiti on his shop to which my answer is yes i do not to kill not to kill but if he shot them in the legs or in the arms i would have considered the man one of the great advancers of civilization in my time and that is what divides left from right because anybody on the left hearing this would think that this is barbaric whereas i consider not stopping these people in any way that is necessary to be barbaric dennis prager on his radio show
7700483 such projections point to a huge opportunity for the front range to improve on the current level of prosperity
7700484 this is an area that plans to add 13 million people
7700485 but immigration and urban population growth will be the defining issue for our country in this century
7700486 i ran for student government president against several boys and lost which did not surprise me but still hurt especially because one of my opponents told me i was really stupid if i thought a girl could be elected president as soon as the election was over the winner asked me to head the organizations committee which as far as i could tell was expected to do most of the work i agreed
7700487 probably the most seen talked about buzzed about speech of the campaign
7700488 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7700489 at agora n o houve um acerto quem sabe na ter a feira teremos alguma novidade

7700500 it was not quite the bodys rejection of the defibrillator
7700501 but its a means for a body to cleanse itself of something foreign to it
7700502 we can no longer ignore the effect television has over our childrens food choices
7700503 we can no longer ignore the effect television has over our children amp squo s food choices
7700504 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7700505 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7700506 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not because that would be speculation
7700507 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
7700508 i will tell you having visited israel a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7700509 they recognise that there are no good military options but they also recognize that it is from their perspective it is unacceptable for iran to have a nuclear weapon
7700510 these intense rains may produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides
7700511 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio program exposing tensions between aq al qaeda leadership and supporters
7700512 and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7700513 we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7700514 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7700515 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7700516 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7700517 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7700518 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7700519 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7700520 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7700521 the costs are high and they need to suppress these fires to protect people
7700522 but the forest service is basically becoming the fire service
7700523 the lead in was the us market and the repetition of the bad news about the credit problems he said
7700524 this is looking like a consolidation pattern for our market he said
7700525 normalised earnings had dropped 24 per cent air new zealand fell one cent to 1 00
7700526 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which has said it may not work
7700527 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7700528 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both
7700529 the kids who are engaging in community sport a lot of them want to have the hope in their eyes that they can rise to elite representational levels as well
7700530 the government is funding a large slab of investment in community level sport school sports indigenous sports but also were not going to be back tracking when it comes to funding for olympic level sports either
7700531 i offered to trade her a fattening hog for those girls
7700532 i meant it as a joke ive said it a million times most people get a kick out of it

7700534 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally

7700538 then she was mocked for bringing it up referred to as whining
7700539 i mean she was the candidate for gods sake he wasnt
7700540 the broadcast wasnt entirely bad and the trio eventually settled in a bit but the first half was beyond horrendous it seemed as if sharpe didnt know he was supposed to be doing play by play and at times he would go five to seven minutes without even describing the action on the field during just about every series and on punts and kickoffs there were gigantic pauses and dead air while the play was going on and occassionally players would be running back to the huddle before he would convey the results
7700541 oh uh there wont be any money but when you die on your deathbed you will receive total consciousness
7700542 todos los colocolinos estamos contentos porque lleg un hombre de la casa un triunfador por donde se mire con una mentalidad ganadora y a pesar de que ha tenido a lo mejor poca ex periencia como t cnico te ne mos ple na con fian za y fe en que volveremos a ju gar co mo todos queremos y vamos a poder conseguir logros y xitos no solo a nivel nacional sino internacional
7700543 wanted to go the other day and he couldnt go
7700544 doctor says hes ok and i dont know whats the problem hes only practiced parts of two practices i think something must be really wrong with his leg
7700545 when we want to change the pace well get him in and get his feet wet
7700546 how many plays hell play i dont know probably depends on how the game goes and how he does
7700547 the results keep demonstrating that changing to circular hooks is the right choice since it favours turtle conservation without having an impact on the economy of artisanal fisheries
7700548 together with fishermen we are building a culture for sustainable fishing practices that will guarantee fish stocks in the long term
7700549 our goal is to reduce the incidental catch of marine turtles from the long line fishing operations without affecting the fisheries activity which is a main source of food and income for local communities
7700550 this programme is going beyond an initial focus of saving sea turtles from bycatch and is creating the groundwork toward sustainable artisanal long line fishing in the eastern pacific

7700557 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7700558 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7700559 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7700560 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7700561 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower

7700577 yeah i grow wheat grass outta my ass crack and they come and graze from there
7700578 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives this is going to be a more workman like speech

7700580 we are after all democrats so it may take a while were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7700581 the truth is im just bitter that clinton didnt get the nomination once again the black man has got something before any woman did sexism is alive and well in this country
7700582 there may be a few of us who go for mccain but most of us understand we need to kick republicans out of the white house

7700586 the democratic party says they stand for social justice we just want them to stand for social justice where it begins in the womb

7700660 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both
7700661 the kids who are engaging in community sport a lot of them want to have the hope in their eyes that they can rise to elite representational levels as well
7700662 the government is funding a large slab of investment in community level sport school sports indigenous sports but also were not going to be back tracking when it comes to funding for olympic level sports either

7700689 a lot of studio space went on hold but the projects didnt materialize until we went after the under 10 million films thats when we picked up
7700690 were hoping that once this sag contract is settled well see more positive impact
7700691 at some point i know another state is going to raise the ante and that there is a good chance feature films could move down the road if we dont get the infrastructure built in a timely fashion
7700692 we are thrilled to join with community leaders and residents in celebrating this significant occasion
7700693 we look forward to celebrating this major step for civil rights as we continue the work to advance equal rights and opportunities for all of us in this country

7700699 wallace was declared an outlaw which meant his life was forfeit and that anyone could kill him without trial he continued his resistance but on august 3rd 1305 he was captured at robroyston near glasgow his captor sir john menteith the false menteith has gone down in scottish legend as the betrayer of wallace but he acted as many others would have menteith was no english lackey and in 1320 he put his seal to the declaration of arbroath
7700700 it is said william wallace enjoyed his last drink as a free man at the well
7700701 english soldiers in 1305 at the site of wallaces capture there stands a monument there have also been proposals put forward for a visitors centre in the area at the site of the monument on the monument there is a plaque in latin dico tibi verum libertas optimum rerum nunquam servili sub nexu vivito fili which translates to i tell you the truth the best of all things is freedom never son live under the bonds of slavery taught to william wallace in his boyhood about 200 yards from the monument wallaces well is located on the country road
7700702 wallaces well was listed in 1970 but historic scotland removed the site from a list of protected properties in march 1993 by 2003 it was considered to be under threat from nearby housing developments

7700706 its always amazing how passionate people are about witness trees at gettysburg
7700707 i think we do have to recognize that while gettysburg does have these beautiful old trees the monumentation on the battlefield is definitely more directed toward the fighting of the battle
7700708 there are probably even more in areas where we havent done studies
7700709 we havent created a complete listing or map of these trees
7700710 there a lot of other trees throughout the woods that would potentially be witness trees
7700711 personally i dont think that all the trees that were left in the codori thicket are historic trees
7700712 its pretty time consuming to take a core and then to properly read it
7700713 that could be a factor that could kill them pretty fast
7700714 president lincoln passed by this tree on november 19 1863

7700718 there is an agreement between both sides that no foreign soldiers will be in iraq after 2011
7700719 must be based on a specific deadline for the withdrawal of foreign forces and that it should not be open
7700720 an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed
7700721 but any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7700722 weve been opposed to arbitrary dates on the calendar especially when things were tough from a security standpoint
7700723 as conditions improve it certainly enables us to have the discussion about goals going forward and where we hope iraqi security forces will be

7700727 we dont think he will be part of our game plan it will be a week to week kind of situation to see how his condition progresses
7700728 we are pretty confident it is not going to be a significant amount of time
7700729 by significant i mean three or four weeks we are optimistic it will be sooner than that

7700735 we finally know what the big faults between wellington and blenheim are doing
7700736 the general discontinuity of active faults across cook strait has important implications for how we interpret the size and location of future earthquakes in the region
7700737 by determining the rate of activity on the faults over many thousands of years we can also estimate the interval of time between earthquakes on each fault

7700854 we came in this morning knowing manu would not play but then we saw him putting the uniform in the locker room silently as manu is
7700855 he put his bandages in his foot and no one said anything he joined his team mates in a warm up and he tried out his foot for 10 minutes but he felt pain and he went back to the locker room got changed and started crying
7700856 for us the thing that struck us was how manu felt he had failed and that just was a further motivation for us to play hard and to play with double the effort
7700857 manu is not irresponsible he is under contract with san antonio and he wouldnt play if he was injured as this was the case
7700858 it touched us all that manu tried to the last minute to play with us
7700859 but we as a team trust the team those who dont know us think that without manu we cannot do anything but that is not true
7700860 of course i could i would always like to have manu playing alongside me but i think what makes a good team is the fact that other players are able to step up in these situations
7700861 its not the same thing going home with a medal than empty handed
7700862 i think my team pulled off a show of unique basketball of temperament of unity and character
7700863 i am really proud of what my team mates did of the game they played
7700864 its not always easy to play for third place but they did an incredible job
7700865 ive been more hurt from an emotional level than a physical one not to be able to play before
7700866 we think there is a huge opportunity to create a range of very effective offset related products around green buildings especially residential if only there was a way to create high quality certified verified credits at a micro scale just look at the now famous mckinsey graph around carbon and see how much below the line ie negative carbon cost is sitting there and not getting done that has to do with buildings but somehow there needs to be a way to pull all the smaller disaggregated pieces together and streamline the ability to create credits from energy efficient green building space when that happens energy companies can create products and services that will encourage better decisions around energy design and use in buildings we think the opportunity to get this rolling through our relationship with carbonflow is a win win
7700867 we have convinced a majority of the senate to support mandatory comprehensive market based legislation to curb global warming and enhance u s energy security
7700868 as an average friday is the most agglomerated day of the week but depends on the season and the positioning of the restaurant

7700883 a great american story modest means but big dreams and encouragement from loving parents
7700884 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night

7700886 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7700887 im a big obama supporter senator clinton is a great person she ran a great race but those of us who are professionals in this business we understand that sometimes things work out and sometimes they dont
7700888 thats going to be the key can we get every democrat back on line supporting obama
7700889 i think hillarys going to deliver a speech which is going to make it absolutely crystal clear what the stakes are ahead for the nation and that there isnt time to wait four years i mean some clinton people say if sen obama loses hillary can win in four years for people without health insurance harry theres no time to wait four years
7700890 i know people are cynical about politicians but we do believe in stuff hillarys fought for universal health care for all her life the mccain plan is respectfully a joke sen obama has a real good plan to bring health care to every american
7700891 weve got to pierce this veneer that john mccain is a moderate john mccain is a wonderful man but hes no moderate he voted against equal pay for women
7700892 were making history and the excitement of hearing obama speak and hillary clinton michelle obama joe biden so im just here to rock it this is woodstock for me
7700893 to create an exhibit of democratic history but also to put that history in a national context so we have documents here from george washington thomas jefferson abraham lincoln extending into the 20th century democratic party franklin roosevelt john f kennedy and everything is an original obviously
7700894 so you took the 26 hours from philadelphia to denver
7700895 the most common question i get is so where do you make your copies
7700896 theres always a convention bounce and i think barack obama is going to get the bulk of the attention this coming week with the democratic convention in denver well try to get our rebuttal in or a little balance as best we can
7700897 in a room filled with apples the promo pictures for season 5 arent anything new these hos look about as waxy as those apples laying around them what is up with all those apples anyway

7700899 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7700900 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them

7700905 i might already have as far as announcing it were not sure were ready to do that right now
7700906 i would look for state specific items i would look for items that were put out by special interest groups
7700907 there were many many buttons made because the invention was new
7700908 you can pick up bryan buttons that are over 100 years old for 30 or you can pick them up for 3 000 plus
7700909 you push a button and his hand pops up so hes thumbing his nose
7700910 turn the sprinkler systems on because the giants are on
7700911 my apologies for using that gag inducing catch phrase but its true the giants are on a certified hot streak having won five games in a row and eight of their last ten timely hitting and good pitching including a couple of starts from barry zito that
7700912 well during this down period in the late aughts the giants were bad but not that of course will be followed by the inevitable

7700917 were not getting all the press all the media hype
7700918 we want to get back to becoming a defense thats turnover happy
7700919 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac
7700920 this will be a nice thing to do so that i can remember to be grateful
7700921 this circumstance in my life stinks right now but god will make everything good god will work it out for good
7700922 when strong bad fails to obey the king of towns totally unfair email tax hes placed under house arrest once freed from his wrongful imprisonment strong bad goes on a mission to unite the local warring factions under the strong badian flag
7700923 he is a true statesman who will always put the country first
7700924 with obama we have words with mccain we have deeds with obama we have rhetoric with mccain we have a record
7700925 during the primary i was a huge supporter of hillary clinton
7700926 they were willing to throw women completely under the bus i just couldnt believe the treatment that hillary clinton got
7700927 there may be a few outliers but overall there is going to be tremendous unity and hillary is going to be leading the charge
7700928 it makes me sad that mccain is using it against us
7700929 it may unite our party against the outsider what he said was the truth but it may unite us against him
7700930 john mccain is trying to make political hay out of an internal dispute
7700931 rates were steady to slightly lower for the week hshs fixed rate mortgage indicator
7700932 yes it hurts like fuck but you would be surprised how freeing it is to get punched in the face

7700944 my name is william rast and this is my life
7700945 the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
7700946 it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimize and normalize anti muslim prejudice in our society

7700950 the times are never so bad that a good man cant live in them
7700951 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7700952 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
7700953 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
7700954 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
7700955 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7700956 is unchanged and unchangeable therefore by the authority which christ conferred upon peter and his successors i declare that direct abortion that is abortion willed as an end or as a means always constitutes a grave moral disorder since it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being this doctrine is based upon the natural law and upon the written word of god is transmitted by the churchs tradition and taught by the ordinary and universal no circumstance no purpose no law whatsoever can ever make licit an act which is intrinsically illicit since it is contrary to the law of god which is written in every human heart knowable by reason itself and proclaimed by the church
7700957 the second commandment of the teaching you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not seduce boys you shall not commit fornication you shall not steal you shall not practice magic you shall not use potions you shall not procure an abortion nor destroy a newborn child
7700958 the way of light then is as follows if anyone desires to travel to the appointed place he must be zealous in his works the knowledge therefore which is given to us for the purpose of walking in this way is the following thou shalt not slay the child by procuring abortion nor again shalt thou destroy it after it is born
7700959 and near that place i saw another strait place and there sat women and over against them many children who were born to them out of due time sat crying and there came forth from them rays of fire and smote the women in the eyes and these were the accursed who conceived and caused abortion
7700960 what man of sound mind therefore will affirm while such is our character that we are murderers w hen we say that those women who use drugs to bring on abortion commit murder and will have to give an account to god for the abortion on what principle should we commit murder for it does not belong to the same person to regard the very fetus in the womb as a created being and therefore an object of gods care and when it has passed into life to kill it and not to expose an infant because those who expose them are chargeable with child murder and on the other hand when it has been reared to destroy it
7700961 in our case a murder being once for all forbidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from the other parts of the body for its sustenance to hinder a birth is merely a speedier man killing nor does it matter whether you take away a life that is born or destroy one that is coming to birth that is a man which is going to be one you have the fruit already in its seed
7700962 among surgeons tools there is a certain instrument which is formed with a nicely adjusted flexible frame for opening the uterus first of all and keeping it open it is further furnished with an annular blade by means of which the limbs of the child within the womb are dissected with anxious but unfaltering care its last appendage being a blunted or covered hook wherewith the entire fetus is extracted by a violent delivery
7700963 there is also another instrument in the shape of a copper needle or spike by which the actual death is managed in this furtive robbery of life they give it from its infanticide function the name of meaning
7700964 the doctors who performed abortions all knew well enough that a living being had been conceived and they pitied this most luckless infant state which had first to be put to death to escape being tortured alive
7700965 now we allow that life begins with conception because we contend that the soul also begins from conception life taking its commencement at the same moment and place that the soul does
7700966 the law of moses indeed punishes with due penalties the man who shall cause abortion ex
7700967 there are some pagan women who by drinking medical preparations extinguish the source of the future man in their very bowels and thus commit a parricide before they bring forth and these things assuredly come down from the teaching of your false gods to us christians it is not lawful either to see or hear of homicide
7700968 women who were reputed to be believers began to take drugs to render themselves sterile and to bind themselves tightly so as to expel what was being conceived since they would not on account of relatives and excess wealth want to have a child by a slave or by any insignificant person see then into what great impiety that lawless one has proceeded by teaching adultery and murder at the same time
7700969 concerning women who commit fornication and destroy that which they have conceived or who are employed in making drugs for abortion a former decree excluded them until the hour of death and to this some have assented nevertheless being desirous to use somewhat greater we have ordained that they fulfill ten years of penance according to the prescribed degrees
7700970 let her that procures abortion undergo ten years penance whether the embryo were perfectly formed or not
7700971 he that kills another with a sword or hurls an axe at his own wife and kills her is guilty of willful murder not he who throws a stone at a dog and unintentionally kills a man or who corrects one with a rod or scourge in order to reform him or who kills a man in his own defense when he only designed to hurt him
7700972 wherefore i beseech you flee fornication why sow where the ground makes it its care to destroy the fruit where there are many efforts at abortion where there is murder before the birth for even the harlot you do not let continue a mere harlot but make her a murderess also you see how drunkenness leads to prostitution prostitution to adultery adultery to murder or rather to a something even worse than murder for i have no name to give it since it does not take off the thing born but prevents its being born why then do thou abuse the gift of god and fight with his laws and follow after what is a curse as if a blessing and make the chamber of procreation a chamber for murder and arm the woman that was given for childbearing unto slaughter for with a view to drawing more money by being agreeable and an object of longing to her lovers even this she is not backward to do so heaping upon thy head a great pile of fire for even if the daring deed be hers yet the causing of it is thine
7700973 i cannot bring myself to speak of the many virgins who daily fall and are lost to the bosom of the church their mother some go so far as to take potions that they may insure barrenness and thus murder human beings almost before their conception some when they find themselves with child through their sin use drugs to procure abortion and when as often happens they die with their offspring they enter the lower world laden with the guilt not only of adultery against christ but also of suicide and child murder
7700974 thou shalt not use magic thou shalt not use witchcraft for he says you shall not suffer a witch to live ex 22 18 thou shall not slay thy child by causing abortion nor kill that which is begotten i f it be slain it shall be avenged as being unjustly destroyed
7700975 as an ardent practising catholic this is an issue i have studied for a long time
7700976 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7700977 for every problem there is a solution that is simple clear and wrong
7700978 is an online encyclopedia of judaism covering jewish beliefs people places things language scripture holidays practices and customs
7700979 make freely available a wide variety of basic general information about judaism written from a traditional perspective in plain english
7700980 when does an adorable little baby named johnny get the human rights that will stop a doctor from sucking him out of the womb with a combination vacuum wood chipper
7700981 whats lacking in the coverage of the afghans is the sense of the humanity of the afghans
7700982 in the prince harry coverage for example there were all these people out there you never really saw them
7700983 you knew that the bombs were dropping in that direction and the guns pointing in that direction but you never got a sense of how afghans are as a people
7700984 it may sound odd but the humanity of the taliban because the taliban are a wide very diverse group of people
7700985 some of them would like to talk to the british government some of them dont want to be fighting british troops some of them would this is the ideological taliban
7700986 we never have the ability or sometimes the desire to present this in a different way so that people would be interested its a regret
7700987 in a country which is as complex and as difficult and dangerous as afghanistan you cant really cover it properly and get the full picture unless you are there day in day out unless you are living there and feeling and eating the heat and the dust
7700988 what does it feel like to be a british soldier under fire its bloody frightening and difficult and dangerous exhilarating as well
7700989 but we also want to know what it feels like to be an afghan involved with such hopes in 2001 that things would get better and theyve got a lot worse
7700990 its a hard one because with an issue like prince harry it meant that there was a series of decisions taken all along the way journalists were one bit of a very long chain
7700991 if harry went there was no doubt that he was going to put himself and the lives of his commanders at risk
7700992 we are making these deals all the time when gordon brown goes to afghanistan we are not allowed to report perhaps it the deal wont happen again
7700993 it probably did bring a lot of people to think about afghanistan who normally wouldnt ordinarily think about afghanistan if the prince harry story can bring more people to think about afghanistan then thats a good thing
7700994 there was a lost opportunity there was hardly any mention of afghans even of afghanistan just a sense of i went to a country far away
7700995 viewing figures went up prince harry got a heros welcome and recruitment for the british army went up so an objective was achieved did that mean people knew more about why britain was there i dont think so
7700996 journalists focused on the human story but it should part of a wider picture
7700997 substantive amendments with a view to increasing the level of comfort with the proposed exemption
7700998 the nsg exemption should be clean and there should be no additional condition
7700999 they may want to push but india cant be pushed civil nuclear cooperation is important but that doesnt mean at any cost
7701000 should we allow ourselves to be pushed are we not indians are you not proud of yourself and what you are doing
7701001 nothing which impinges or seem to impinge on indias national interest will be acceptable
7701002 the us and india stand shoulder to shoulder in their desire for a clean exception and we will continue to work with our indian partners to persuade the nsg countries that such an exemption is in the international communitys best interest
7701003 continue our vigorous joint advocacy for the initiative at the highest levels of nsg governments
7701004 we think it is important to find ways to go forward in a transparent fashion with india as they develop nuclear energy
7701005 its too important given the size of indias economy given the size of its nuclear infrastructure and its aspirations in nuclear generation we need to find a way to embrace them in bring them into the tent
7701006 has been travelling india these past few weeks from south to north and now finds himself in than highways
7701007 military maneuvers that make me wonder if the australian commander might be smarter than ours id also be curious what the commander has to say about global warming miss wagstaff presents

7701010 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
7701011 a lot of people use the floor to ceiling racks or the free standing racks something that kind of puts it right up against the wall

7701013 there is another option where you can mount it up on ceiling where its up out of the way its not taking up space on your wall its just taking up on the dead space above your head that you are not using

7701015 dont store it on its side just because typically if you lean it on its side where the gears are you are going to have a couple of problems when it comes time to ride it again things may be out of alignment and not shifting properly
7701016 dont store it next it a refrigerator or an air conditioner because any kind of rapid heat change the cycle of the heat changes can mess up the bike components and mess up the paint generally make sure your tires are aired up before it goes into storage it should hold up better that way

7701052 at this point in time i must say im bummed out
7701053 so after almost finishing the painting i come to class and the date got pushed back another week what a surprise the concept of my work was about time and here it goes again what would i do if i only had time the knowledge of time could be one of the greatest abilities to posses when talking about time the reference to seeing the future also presents a problem or a solution the unknown is one of the most pecular things i find that motovates humans math theories drug use the road to fame all use this strongly to motivate them individuals if i could look down the road in 2 years it would be a lot easier to change things keep things the same and as of now there is no way to do that if i could put that into my painting that would be great the only way i can think of to put that in my painting is to refer to the past as being one point the present and future at one time i didnt know twhat it was going to be like to be friend with arianna then at one point i met her and had to act approately we eventually became great friends now she has moved home throughtout these times i didn not know how anything was going to workout what i did know is that at each point in time these times we shared and reminessed about older times were at one point the future oviously i wnated to become friends and hang out there are times i did not want liek her moving back home but some things you can not control such as the future but if its in your reach you should try as hard as you can im not sure what will happen in the future but im sure its going to happen
7701054 5 more days until the painting is due im working on the clouds today and also the large branch in the top right its not lookgin too good right now but will be soon
7701055 so at this time the whole idea of dual existence of the mind and body have been tossed away in a book somewhere for a later time i realized i dont have the skills to pull off the painting at this time in my early years as a painter i think that multiple existences are important perception body mentality mind morality soul motivation spirit but i dont know how to incorporate them all in the same visual piece b c getting all these in one piece takes a lot of skill passion
7701056 after reading this short text message i wanted to talk about emotional vulnerability for the simple fact that she is very right what your friends say about you is true if they really know you
7701057 in my painting these three are all present in my piece the physical self is shown as a ver realistic visual copy image of myself as best to my ability i think it is one of the better portraits in class not to sound cocky i do like emilys and the one w the 2 fish the psychological part of me is represented by the eternally moving tunnels though the background of my painting it also represents my mind w so many thoughts and the constant turing and moving of thought in my mind the spiritual self goes right along with my painting about the psychological state b c my spiritual had become more about what inside of me rather than the outside
7701058 i am here tonight to pay tribute to two men who have changed my life and the life of this country barack obama and edward m kennedy caroline kennedy said in remarks prepared for her speech
7701059 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family kennedy said the excerpts released by the democratic party
7701060 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7701061 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now
7701062 and i know someone else whos been inspired all over again by senator obama
7701063 more than any senator of his generation or perhaps any generation teddy has made life better for people in this country and around the world
7701064 for 46 years he has been so much more than just a senator for the people of massachusetts hes been a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died
7701065 it would mean for example in this current financial year a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion he told abc radio
7701066 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7701067 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7701068 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7701069 if they decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried senator evans told abc radio
7701070 were having interest from the government now senator brown told reporters
7701071 id prefer to call wheeling and dealing negotiating on a sensible basis to get a better outcome for the electorate that gave us the balance of power
7701072 whilst capital management remains an important issue given the current uncertainty in the debt and equity markets it is considered prudent to defer any capital management activity at this time
7701073 a share buyback will be continually assessed in the context of other initiatives and the capital market environment
7701074 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels the company said
7701075 the lower fuel margins reflect the decision not to pass onto customers the full cost increases experienced over the last 12 months increasing the competitiveness of our offer
7701076 you get off the plane and get a welcome like this and its addictive
7701077 id like to be there but that might not be tenable
7701078 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7701079 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7701080 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7701081 in her speech michelle will give the country a personal view of barack obama her husband and sasha and malias dad
7701082 she will talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7701083 the more america learns about this family the more theyre going to want to send them to the white house
7701084 michelle will also talk about her upbringing on the south side of chicago
7701085 talk about our family and this campaign and why we have made this commitment
7701086 im just going to speak to simon they way i speak to everybody
7701087 im just going have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7701088 tomorrows like the first day of pre school for me
7701089 all i know is im on the judging panel and im supposed to have my makeup done by 11 tomorrow
7701090 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters
7701091 we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7701092 i am concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
7701093 anybody with the right brain would say something like that shes just probably pondering what could and could not happen
7701094 being able to watch somebody sing and evaluate them is sort of what i do every day
7701095 make sure that what theyre singing and how theyre singing it feels true to them and is artistry and not just karaoke
7701096 im just somebody whos really honest and gives my opinion
7701097 and if i feel i need to be hard with someone to get that across i will be and if i feel i need to be softer and more nurturing with some of the contestants ill be that
7701098 that when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is
7701099 well i know a few farmers here and there around town around the outskirts
7701100 what did you guys do before you had air conditioning in the summers
7701101 we have to make sure that access to college is not an empty promise
7701102 young men are less likely to be joiners if theyre engaged theyre happy if theyre happy they stay
7701103 understands that the campaign manager is not to be tooting his own horn and talking to the media
7701104 one thing we major in in chicago is campaigns and politics
7701105 barack obama is very very insistent on getting a diverse set of voices
7701106 that was one of the main things he wanted to tell me and make sure i personally viewed as my job
7701107 had we not done so today it would still be sitting there blighted
7701108 we have a bunch of empty buildings all over the country
7701109 i hope this project will give us a platform so that we can make informed decisions
7701110 there are 15 major retailers multiply that by 2 000 stores each with a 20 to 25 year life cycle its not unreasonable to expect that closure would happen during that time
7701111 we as a city now have a central location for our seniors thats better than having it on the outskirts of town
7701112 this is just a wakeup call for parents who have kids involved in sport activities to make sure that they are getting enough to drink
7701113 when she got home she became sick again from it and she quit breathing on me
7701114 they had to breath for her she was in critical condition they had to get her stable to get back to the hospital
7701115 this particular part of the marching band was inside for over half the practice in the morning
7701116 but i want to make sure that everybody does take the time and make sure they keep a close eye on the kids and an even closer eye when that humidity climbs with the heat
7701117 holding on to the sweetness of life only makes the bitter feel like the betrayal of a promise that was never made
7701118 we were all born on days when too many people died in terrible ways but you still have to call it
7701119 just as we were about to begin recording the song we heard a knock at the door
7701120 the policeman continued to address him in a courteous fashion i followed them to the police sector and waited at the corner lest they decide to arrest me as well and there be no one left to relay the news of his arrest
7701121 when the patrol car had left i approached the arresting officer who was still there and asked him where gorki had been taken
7701122 on my way back i met with gorkis father who on learning the news became very nervous and proceeded to
7701123 they basically have sent the message loud and clear we are tired of meta emulated crap we want the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect we want them done right and if the price is right well buy
7701124 there have been a few complaints in edmonton the kids are smart enough or intuitive enough to tell mom and dad and mom and dad will contact the police
7701125 what usually happens is the predator will get online and try to make contact and communicate and then try to get them into a more private setting like possibly msn messenger where they can have a chat with them and from there things can progress
7701126 people play sports together in real life they gain trust and friendships the same thing can happen online
7701127 you just leave and go somewhere else and play a different game or whatever
7701128 ive had those conversations with them since they were just little kids to talk about the safety and what to be aware of
7701129 if somebody comes on and starts asking them questions or is trying to engage them in conversation that is not about the game such as what do they do and where do they live and about their bodies then they should just turn it off or tell them to go away
7701130 this was by far some of the most incredible work ive done i dont regret this past year for second
7701131 we were hoping the community would really get behind this thing
7701132 i still hope faith stories will have a ministry in the community
7701133 i cant give you a tab unless you buy something pal
7701134 just because this shit is about buddy holly and that
7701135 hoho for i have stolen another 25 cents from someone on the internet my dastardly deeds know no bounds

7701209 perhaps most admirable about kaui hart hemmingss debut novel the descendants is that she manages a compelling serious story set in hawaii without falling prey to schmaltzy descriptions of clueless tourists cloudless skies and smiling brown locals its a rare feat but hemmings one of the few nationally recognized contemporary fiction writers from hawaii succeeds with ease
7701210 my polynesian ancestors would be disappointed in me in all of us

7701219 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both

7701226 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions he said
7701227 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7701228 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year
7701229 we can no longer ignore the effect television has over our childrens food choices

7701231 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7701232 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7701233 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not because that would be speculation
7701234 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
7701235 i will tell you having visited israel a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7701236 successfully achieving 50 of nameplate capacity at such a highly technical refinery is a testimony not only to the quality of this unique asset but to the outstanding work conducted by our plant personnel during this start up period by designing a refinery that has the ability to take a multitude of different feedstocks greenhunter has the ability to source and procure the least expensive raw materials possible around the world this allows our company to achieve the greatest possible operating margins within the business today we believe the distilled water white quality performance of the greenhunter biofuels facility will contribute to a new quality standard in the global biodiesel marketplace
7701237 hadits ini tidak menunjukkan bahwa selain waktu pagi adalah waktu yang tidak diberkahi sesuatu yang dilakukan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pada waktu tertentu adalah waktu yang berkah dan beliau shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah sebaik baik uswah suri teladan bagi umatnya adapun nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mengkhususkan waktu pagi dengan mendoakan keberkahan pada waktu tersebut daripada waktu waktu yang lainnya karena pada waktu pagi tersebut adalah waktu yang biasa digunakan manusia untuk memulai amal aktivitas waktu tersebut adalah waktu bersemangat fit untuk beraktivitas oleh karena itu nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mengkhususkan doa pada waktu tersebut agar seluruh umatnya mendapatkan berkah di dalamnya

7701239 dalam hadits ini terdapat anjuran berdzikir setelah shubuh dan mengontinukan duduk di tempat shalat jika tidak memiliki udzur halangan al qadhi mengatakan bahwa inilah sunnah yang biasa dilakukan oleh salaf dan para ulama mereka biasa memanfaatkan waktu tersebut untuk berdzikir dan berdoa hingga terbit matahari
7701240 apa yang menghalangi kalian padahal aku telah mengizinkan kalian untuk masuk
7701241 segala puji bagi allah yang telah menolong kami berdzikir pada pagi hari ini
7701242 syaikhul islam ibnu taimiyah suatu saat shalat shubuh kemudian setelah shalat shubuh beliau duduk sambil berdzikir kepada allah taala hingga pertengahan siang kemudian berpaling padaku dan berkata ini adalah kebiasaanku di pagi hari jika aku tidak berdzikir seperti ini hilanglah kekuatanku atau perkataan beliau yang semisal ini

7701253 as publisher of the upcoming action role playing game sacred 2 fallen angel we are delighted to spotlight these great bands that share a north american record label with blind guardian
7701254 having blind guardian perform a very special song in game and having enjoyed the tremendous support from nuclear blast records this is a great opportunity to give back to heavy metal fans that were certain will enjoy not only the great music from the four bands on the death by decibels tour 2008 but also sacred 2 fallen angel when it ships this fall on pc and next generation console

7701257 nato russian relations will need to take fully into account the implications of russian military actions in georgia
7701258 however we believe it would be a mistake to suspend all nato russia contacts when they are so much needed
7701259 we are ready to accept any decision up to halting relations altogether
7701260 we regret that this vote will only add tension in the region
7701261 we call on russia to live up to its commitments and refrain from acts which may further raise already very high levels of tension
7701262 this move can only raise suspicions about russias motives and aims coming after news of continued russian military activity in senaki and poti

7701268 professor tashihiko ando chairman of the totoro no furusato national fund has stated that hayao miyazaki has described my neighbor totoro as a movie that portrayed a paradise for children
7701269 the sayama forest is the embodiment of that paradise the auction is a wonderful opportunity for artists to help preserve this historic forest for future generations of children and pay tribute to miyazaki san and the film that has been so inspirational to their art

7701273 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7701274 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7701275 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7701276 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7701277 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7701278 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7701279 ive talked to the mccain campaign a little bit about the issue but certainly not about me being in that mix
7701280 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7701281 this is still in process and its not over until its over
7701282 its been a difficult case in todays parlance its been very challenging

7701286 now in a first for me i am supporting a republican john mccain
7701287 i am supporting john mccain because i believe in his candidacy
7701288 i am not being used i am not being paid to do this i am doing this as a volunteer because i believe we have to stand up for our country
7701289 deb is free to make her own choices but there are many hillary supporters who back barack
7701290 i am the first to come out and i want to let you know it is okay to come out you can disagree with the party just support a candidate you can believe in
7701291 i think its so important that we make sure our families are safe
7701292 what were some of the sessions who were some of the speakers
7701293 i thought it would have been great for her to be there so im disappointed disappointed and angry as a taxpayer
7701294 she was angry that there was not a carrying bag for the information
7701295 she took a bag she got from one of the vendors and filled it with items like donuts and muffins and soda and then left the conference
7701296 the executive director says you took a bag filled it with muffins donuts and candy and then stormed out of there
7701297 they would gain access to the house by pretending to be healthcare workers or play on the sympathy of the homeowner to get inside and once they were inside they would split up one of them would go around the house and find any valuables
7701298 no i feel like im a goof i was taken advantage of and i let my sympathies and believing in people being honest get the best of me
7701299 its especially disturbing when its elderly residents because they may not have any other family to talk about it with and theyve lost some very precious valuable pieces of property that may never be recovered
7701300 i didnt even know if i wanted to be a christian anymore
7701301 are you sure you have to pee because i only have so many cups
7701302 here to cure your horrible uncomfortable mystery disease we have either a steroids or b fruit loops and kitten kisses
7701303 oh its just that my sister was on it for a long time and it turned out really badly
7701304 and amazingly your second comment worse than your first you should just stop
7701305 im sorry im going to have to look at your rings
7701306 all skill is in vain when an angel pisses in the flintlock of your musket
7701307 this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke
7701308 and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications
7701309 of the 11 deaths in ontario six have been characterized as where the listeria bacteria has been an underlying or contributing factor in the death
7701310 five are still under investigation in terms of determining the extent of the contribution of the bacteria to the death of the individuals
7701311 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping your food safe with standards well beyond regulatory requirements but this week our best efforts failed and we are deeply sorry
7701312 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7701313 what was most galling was that there was nothing i could do this cruel disease takes its own course
7701314 i had to keep telling her the bad news over and over again
7701315 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir
7701316 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which have said it may not work
7701317 i think people are concerned certainly theres about 20 000 children not enrolled in school and if children are not in the system theyve got no chance in life
7701318 there was a very good discussion a lot of points put on the table which the ministers took on board and i guess that will formulate the basis of further discussion to caucus
7701319 its got all of the hallmarks of the way prime minister mr kevin rudd operates
7701320 you come up with some sort of media driven stunt to start a particular series of otherwise unpleasant political events
7701321 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is put out there publicly
7701322 every party has those issues and thats the tension between the caucus and the ministry
7701323 the bottom line is every kid should be going to school and there are kids who arent going to school and that causes long term problems
7701324 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school
7701325 this is taxpayers money and we want it to be used properly for the benefit of children
7701326 if people are squandering their money and taking it down the pub and the tab and the local casino weve got a right to make sure the taxpayers money is spent properly
7701327 in this case if they dont take the right decision and make sure children get the benefit of taxpayers funds they should be caned
7701328 we had a system like this for people who wag work wag job interviews wag work for the dole
7701329 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7701330 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7701331 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7701332 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7701333 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7701334 they always have my back theyre very protective theyre 10 times more cool when you meet them and hang out with them all the time theyre hilarious
7701335 i think he could go your way with just a little urging
7701336 hey ron your wife told me you might vote for me but i need to do a little work to show i have plans for small businesses
7701337 and then you have the antacid following right up there
7701338 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7701339 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
7701340 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7701341 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7701342 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7701343 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
7701344 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
7701345 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7701346 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7701347 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7701348 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7701349 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7701350 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7701351 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream
7701352 we spend our time in a condominium in washington a condominium in phoenix some time over here in the state of california and then we have a place up in northern arizona
7701353 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7701354 the white house was saved by the action of one brave soldier
7701355 i know youve been asking about who i want to be my running mate
7701356 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time
7701357 personally i guess the growth in internet penetration is one of the main reasons behind the growth in laptop sales the number of internet users in the arab world is in a continues growth for instance social networking users in arabia and africa grew up by 66 in 2008 so were are talking about millions of arabs are on social networking sites not to mention other internet services more reasons to be online
7701358 little girls in saudi arabia which i will use as an example from now on given that qatars population equals that of boston deserve to have strong heroes too
7701359 after four kids i need it im a gg at the moment and when i take my bra off my nipples are by my feet i want to be a dd instead
7701360 she has wanted it for quite some time kerry is enjoying her life and getting on with doing things she wants to
7701361 i think this is a great place to get a little attention on what no child left behind is doing to our kids and to our teachers
7701362 i just slapped it together with some glue and put it on
7701363 under no circumstances will i be a candidate for vice president
7701364 i am committed to what i am doing in the united states senate and serving the people of virginia and of the country but thank you for your question
7701365 for the past 17 months i and my staff have been working every day to provide first class educational benefits to those who have served since 9 11
7701366 i probably would change my vote from mccain to obama if webb goes on the ticket
7701367 when most men hit 60 they buy a red corvette
7701368 women cant fight because they are biologically unsuited for combat he called the naval academy
7701369 you must walk back with me to my room rascasse because because
7701370 oh well she is a woman with very red hair very cold sometimes she is thin and sometimes she is fat she comes very close and goes away at the same time like a pendule she is the ghost of a mountain in finland and she wants me to go back because i promised never to leave her
7701371 it is terrible i get so easily drunk let us talk philosophy what is your philosophy
7701372 but you are young later you can be material now is the time to believe
7701373 how silly what about life what is life what is progress what is growth
7701374 but i do believe in growth and progress i believe that one is young then not so young then old then very old then dead timid then bold then cautious then crusty then feeble fresh then stale innocent then guilty then totally indifferent first generous and then mean thin then fat thoughtless then selfish hairy then bald what more can you want
7701375 no but shes sorry for me because shes a virgin and so she tries to make it up to me
7701376 yes but shes sorry for the colonial too because he takes her everywhere in his car
7701377 you see in me a creature in the most refined state of intoxication
7701378 i dont want to be too drunk on our first date so i did what i had to do
7701379 if they convey that sense of passion and focus and they bring their own stories into it the issues will take care of themselves
7701380 but too often democrats think its an intellectual debate about policy nuances that aint it and thats why weve lost in the past sometimes weve got to make sure people understand who these people are
7701381 theyre not going to listen to much on issues unless they feel that they know both of these candidates
7701382 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
7701383 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
7701384 they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7701385 shame on all of us for not helping with the project
7701386 after all he has done for us every man woman and child should have chipped in to build our greatest alaskan ever a home the size of the white house
7701387 most importantly however disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7701388 the government wishes to smuggle in suggestions of bribery and corruption that it has not charged and cannot prove
7701389 the slow response of most carmakers shows that the eu needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long term co2 targets
7701390 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7701391 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7701392 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7701393 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7701394 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7701395 thats something that obviously we are going to have to evaluate given the current situation i dont have any announcements on that one way or another
7701396 she is on her way to the little country of georgia
7701397 russian aggression is now basically trying to dismember that country in many ways
7701398 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7701399 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7701400 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7701401 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7701402 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7701403 thats something that obviously we are going to have to evaluate given the current situation i dont have any announcements on that one way or another
7701404 grave damage to our national security and undermined our democratic values
7701405 our families cannot afford four more years of recession stagnation and failure barack obama will steer us back in the right direction
7701406 as the stats from this month and previous months indicate theres large upwards momentum ready for the myspace music launch
7701407 it benefits the whole community we get half of the ticket sales and that goes to the three schools two fire brigades and the local club
7701408 after the heavy rain last month the road just disappeared we looked at moving part of the stage but the preferred option was to keep it there
7701409 the article infers that by supporting the completion of the waikato expressway that i support tolling of that road
7701410 we see completion of the road as something that people would see as major benefit to hamilton however this does not mean we would complete this project by way of a road toll on motorists
7701411 with maurice you dont need secret microphones to learn the true agenda he has alerted us to a clear national party intention to privatise our roads schools and other infrastructure and we are indebted to him for getting the real message out there
7701412 yesterday was very much like a summer day to get those thunderstorms to develop in the afternoon is a summer situation
7701413 if its a slow moving thunderstorm it could produce 15 20mm of rain in one area but likewise if you head a few kilometres in one direction you get nothing that scenario holds true for today
7701414 we havent announced it yet but were looking at it very closely i think we will make some changes
7701415 we are worried about security of supply but my personal view is they are damn ugly
7701416 after about the 10th fake facebook site for me we decided to set one up feel free to join
7701417 we didnt get to the speed we wanted we tried a lot of different setups with the bike more weight less weight different body positions but we couldnt stop the wheel spin
7701418 we went better than last year and weve come away with some more ideas with what we want to do next time there was a strong kiwi contingent there this year and we got good support from the americans as well
7701419 within the next four weeks it will more than double and will peak in late october at 80 million litres per day for the country
7701420 you will be seeing more of our tankers out on the roads over the coming weeks
7701421 20 per cent bigger than the current dairy farms in the region
7701422 we have had record production in the early winter months but recent rain has dampened things down and created difficult conditions for suppliers
7701423 i was quite interested in engineering and then the course came up so i got interested in welding
7701424 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7701425 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7701426 i have been a vet for 20 years and have seen about three in that time
7701427 if we were ever to have a change in forecast of that magnitude we would be telling our farmers first
7701428 what we have been saying is its a very volatile market and we are seeing prices softening a bit on the other side we are seeing our dollar get weaker
7701429 he is probably on the ball quoting 8 on the back of favourable exchange rates that now exist because of the fallout in some of our prices
7701430 its a right to hire clause not a right to fire clause
7701431 were happy for it to be in australia but i think everyone will miss rally new zealand
7701432 its hard to pull such a good rally out of the championship id prefer them both to be in instead of one of them missing out each year but thats the way the rules are
7701433 rally australia has always been a great event too and one of the favourites with the drivers its quite a different rally to new zealand but they are both so good to drive
7701434 i think its the nature of the roads its always good fun to drive its fast and flowing and its usually the fastest guy that wins
7701435 i would rather be fighting for first but its good to be in this position first is a long way away and weve set our goals for third in the championship
7701436 mccabe said madison has changed greatly since he first began working there in 1981 he said the way politics is done in 2008 would be unrecognizable compared to 1981 politics the culprit said mccabe is the large amount of money in politics especially the large amount of dollars going to political action committees pals organizations that take donations without having to disclose their sources while political candidates are required to disclose all of their donations and the law restricts how much individuals can give to each candidate mccabe repeatedly used wisconsin manufacturers amp commerce wmc as an example
7701437 in later comments state sen bob jauch said more democrats are needed in madison to bring about needed reform jauch was asked if the democratically controlled u s legislature senate and house had created any significant campaign reform after gaining control in 2006 jauch was unable to mention any federal reform he did direct some angry comments at wmc which has placed issue ads against jauch he said the wmc acted like the ku klux klan in bullying candidates take the hoods off jauch said of the wmc
7701438 not sure if it works but the shutter clicks and all the dials turn
7701439 this is only the second time weve been over 100 this late in the year in last 50 years
7701440 ok this is it i am going to die i love you matt

7701444 la seule chose laquelle je pense d sormais cest me marier avec estelle je lui demande sa main
7701445 the struggle for womens rights is a story of strong women willing to take the lead and pave the way toward equal voting rights for all american citizens
7701446 we also recognize the women who continue in this tradition by acting as role models in their communities helping raise the next generation of americans leading in their professions and serving in the armed forces protecting our country
7701447 so that all americans can realize the great promise of our nation
7701448 using new compositional analysis techniques not available in the 1960s the team determined that the bullet fragments involved in the assassination are not nearly as rare as previously reported leading to the recommendation that the bullet fragments be reanalyzed
7701449 i think the russian government understands the limited capabilities of this system
7701450 we have had unprecedented discussions that have explained the technical capabilities of the system i think on the face of it they understand 10 interceptors in poland would have no impact on the russians strategic offensive forces
7701451 the patriot battery in question will be a u s army patriot battery so that it will be owned and operated by the united states army
7701452 what we have said to the russians is that this is not a system which is aimed at russia but rather is aimed at the growing threats we see from places like the middle east
7701453 theres no question that russia remains in violation of that agreement
7701454 we still see large numbers of russian troops in undisputed territory we see them maintaining checkpoints we still see the activity in poti
7701455 we continue to encourage them to live up to the commitment that their president made that they would fully withdraw and live up to the agreement
7701456 stay away from cheap tools cheap guns and cheap women theyll all let you down when you need them the most

7701466 the footprints of god the story of salvation from abraham to augustine
7701467 with my years of gymnastic and martial art training coming together to blend well with the aerial work i felt as though i was like a duck to water
7701468 finally doing something i loved and was inspired by something to push my creative and physical boundaries something i felt completely natural doing

7701506 among the many developments in the story last week was the solidifying consensus that the nation is in really serious trouble and the noticeable slippage of legitimacy among those pretending to run financial affairs
7701507 it was not quite the bodys rejection of the defibrillator

7701520 not a terror to good works but to the evil
7701521 we must honour even the worst tyrant in the office in which the lord has seen fit to set him
7701522 if you go on to infer that only just governments are to be repaid by obedience your reasoning is stupid
7701523 the concept of privacy embodies the moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole
7701524 there are moral facts but that is certainly not one of them
7701525 the state community colleges averaged a 6 9 percent increase in enrollment
7701526 but we show a 9 1 percent increase miami dade college which fkcc considers its close competitor registered an increase 3 percentage points below us

7701528 if students get a good learning experience they will return the next semester
7701529 students told me they had to pick between their jobs and school their schedule was so sporadic that they didnt have a chunk of time on campus thats just not helpful those kinds of changes really changed the overall satisfaction with the educational experience

7701533 the listing itself is nothing special except that the system is pictured alongside a very nice rack system which unfortunately does not seem to be included
7701534 the bluefluid surf racks are simple and quick to fit i had the racks and boards on the car in 5 minutes they worked perfectly on the weekend to carry 3 boards on our 2 door car we are about one and a half hours from the beach and most of that is freeway driving the boards stayed right where they should at 100km h
7701535 never once do i see you slam a republican conservative i wonder why hmmmmmmm
7701536 its a rubbish bill that will put huge costs on the economy for no good environmental purpose it should be dumped
7701537 the ets will cost jobs keep wages down and make goods and services more expensive

7701541 if one tree falls into a power line that can cause an outage for an entire neighborhood
7701542 i was asking them to please get out of the tree that we have professional tree trimmers that trim our trees
7701543 if a tree is within 10 feet of a power line it has to be an oncor certified arborist
7701544 accounting for sway when theres wind so the trees dont sway into the power lines and for re growth that happens every year
7701545 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7701546 beat was the one that got me hooked onto the genre decks verse on
7701547 was the one that opened my eyes to all the talented rappers out there rae and ghost on
7701548 just a bored mc sounding like he was called upon to do some rapping chores and thats one of the problems of
7701549 features way too much singing and while the choruses arent too bad it certainly has a negative effect on the hardcore image the clan constantly perpetuates
7701550 represent the albums lower points with bland production that doesnt satisfy the boom bap demanding fans nor does it fit in with the new direction rzas taking and i think thats the real problem of
7701551 where rza crafted a track entirely upon violins i think its rather more the fact that some of the beats here are just plain old boring
7701552 complete with stomping drums harsh strings and curtis mayfield vocals drifting eerily in and out
7701553 while striving to create a different style is a commendable effort by rza and he certainly succeeds
7701554 flips a bob james sample easy mo bee style blending together the latters signature jazzy bass laden style and sharp vinyl scratches while
7701555 by the beatles rza showcases his sensitive side meticulously crafting a luscious delicate track that seamlessly blends between the mesmeric guitar playing of red hot chili peppers john frusciante the soulful vocals of erykah badu and the gritty urban tales of rae ghost and meth
7701556 features an alluring guitar loop that floats over a sample of nancy sinatras
7701557 should be satisfying enough for any fan demanding a kick back to the 36 chambers boasting a hard hitting break beat menacing horns and characteristic kung fu samples however despite all these new sounds and styles floating in and out of
7701558 an effective heart rendering homage to the late ol dirty bastard
7701559 ghost has constantly put other mcs to shame delivering quality verse after quality verse
7701560 sunlight where deep philosophical questions are pondered over a ambience filled beat
7701561 rza gza deck rae meth u god and masta killa all deliver tearful and equally moving verses as they reminisce pay tribute and evoke memory of their lost brother ol dirty
7701562 i popped a bottle on your born day god tried hard not to cry i still cant hide the scar and i still ask why to god analyzing your form as i stood there beside your mom and i share the blame cuz you was calling for help kid shouldve wouldve couldve had the time i was selfish i carry on your struggle each day it really hurts me i really miss you russell hope you forgive me dirty

7701565 in their english style stadium it will be a battle but we are determined we want to go through
7701566 we were tidy and played with balance but theres lots to work on
7701567 it was a useful international experience van gaal is a maestro and we learned some things such as the fact that opponents like these never throw the ball away now our thoughts are on the slavia game and finding continuity
7701568 we have a number of situations that could be resolved in the next few days
7701569 all strikers want to score their first goal and he has been able to do that we are delighted for him
7701570 we will go out and give our best we have 90 minutes to get back into it

7701572 i ndividuals and entities engaging in such unlawful activity may be subject to civil as well as criminal prosecution
7701573 will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who manipulate markets with this witchs brew of damaging rumors and short sales
7701574 require that broker dealers and investment advisers have supervisory and compliance controls in place to prevent violations of the securities laws including market manipulation
7701575 enforcement investigations into alleged intentional manipulation of securities prices through rumor mongering and abusive short selling are already under way
7701576 rumors regarding the unwillingness of key counterparties to deal with certain financial institutions
7701577 probably because of the difficulty in tracing where a false rumor starts and proving that it was knowingly false these cases havent been brought in the past
7701578 when you go to input billing and you see somebody is 60 90 120 days delinquent you follow up with a phone call or you maybe dont take on a new matter thats going to require a lot of labor it helps significantly at least to know your attorneys and staff know what theyre dealing with that theyre not operating in the dark
7701579 law firms are notorious in terms of waiting until the end of the year to concentrate on collecting receivables
7701580 many law firms have gotten better at this in recent years its still a problem for many
7701581 lawyers train their clients as to when they want to be paid
7701582 if every year they delay collection efforts until october and november they are training their clients that they dont have to pay in the first half of the year and they dont have to pay promptly
7701583 clients tend to hoard their cash which means they delay payments to vendors which include lawyers the result being significant slowdowns in collections for law firms which can cause serious cash flow difficulties
7701584 we had to respond to that which we did and very effectively so that by the end of july that over 90 day amount had receded back to the lower end of our historical norm for 90 day account receivables which is 38 percent
7701585 you hope that attorneys will always be cognizant of what their clients owe
7701586 we had one of the partners meet personally with each of the attorneys to discuss their high accounts receivable and what plans they were making to call the clients and make arrangements to be sure it was paid
7701587 we have spent a lot of effort on client intake really reviewing the clients and screening them and i think you have to increase that vigilance and those efforts in these economic times
7701588 we dont let clients get behind and then try to round them up
7701589 we try to have periodic cleanup periods for clients that might be lagging a bit and i try to do it quarterly
7701590 if in fact theres someone where we have fallen off their payment radar screen we try and make sure that we touch base with them periodically and make sure there are no problems with their perception of our services and explain to them that we need to be paid like anybody else
7701591 theres no one size fits all we monitor it pretty much weekly we know where every dollar is outstanding and why
7701592 borrowing is up significantly which tells us two things firms are investing tremendously in new cases which we know isnt necessarily the case or collections arent coming in
7701593 as a lender you start to become concerned when your clients cant pay back their debt or when the pay down takes longer than it used to were in no place where were uncomfortable
7701594 its not that simple because we have a clientele of very sophisticated very strong real estate investors developers entrepreneurs who im not worried about at all
7701595 its just not as simple as saying youve got to worry about the real estate industry you really have to take it client by client
7701596 law firms are reluctant to do it because it may be difficult to get a lawsuit resolved in an expedited manner
7701597 i generally go along with it unless theres some other aspect to it that i might want to address with them
7701598 law firms dont want to antagonize the general counsel of a long term client with whom they have a long term relationship
7701599 i think that the rate increase in 2009 will be modest compared to the prior five years
7701600 the name change will better reflect the firms 80 year history as one of the worlds premier law firms
7701601 they have a view on the world thats very outward looking they felt their existing platform did not allow them to have access to those kinds of opportunities
7701602 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7701603 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7701604 the senator has even brought his military record into discussion of his music tastes explaining that his favorite song was dancing queen by abba he offered that his knowledge of music stopped evolving when his plane intercepted a surface to air missile dancing queen however was produced in 1975 eight years after mccains plane was shot down
7701605 we got there at 4 30 because thats what the rules said to do
7701606 then we waited in this really long line but there were just way too many people so they said the poster contest was closed i saw some kids crying but it was still fun to make the poster anyway
7701607 sure oh and how many copies are we talking about
7701608 let me check wait thats wrong its not six thousand

7701616 por ahora voy a asumir la responsabilidad de sacar la tarjeta
7701617 ninguno de los pol ticos me convence eso es lo que voy a expresar en mi papeleta
7701618 en el fondo uno no sabe si va a votar para bien o para mal
7701619 voy a votar porque si me quedo callado voy a ser un cualquiera
7701620 para poner su granito de arena porque sino no te puedes quejar despu s
7701621 quiero votar para que haya un mejor comienzo el a o que viene a ver si mejora el gobierno
7701622 quiero votar para salir de este gobierno para hacer un cambio pol tico en el pa s el que sea

7701624 nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7701625 put on similar clothing to the outfit worn by the man who personally ordered thousands of americans including women and kids to be burned to death
7701626 unfortunately the man who personally ordered the burning to death of thousands of americans in new york city including women and children also wears that clothing
7701627 he has a fundamentally dim and negative view of this country and he does not want to be put in that category that you get put in when you proudly wear the flag
7701628 after a while you start noticing people wearing a lapel pin but not acting very patriotic
7701629 h e never took em on one by one and specifically in any detail unpacked em and repudiated em
7701630 w e must isolate hamas unless and until they renounce terrorism recognize israels right to exist and abide by past agreements
7701631 couldnt bring the cameras to visit the injured troops it was hey screw the troops
7701632 in fact nbc news chief foreign affairs correspondent andrea mitchell on july 25 reported that obama
7701633 i can attest to the fact that he did visit troops in iraq only four or five days earlier that there was no notice of it that i confirmed that it happened but they had no video of any type and no reporters and that hes been to walter reed army medical center so lets at least get that off the table

7701685 many fish are hard to tell apart once theyve been filleted and packaged
7701686 we hope our work lights the way to getting mislabelled and endangered fish species out of grocery store refrigerators and frying pans
7701687 this not only raises concerns of consumer fraud but also public health
7701688 we are not certain where the mislabelling occurs but it seems it is not the fishermen since the mislabelled fish are from completely different parts of the world
7701689 perhaps the mislabelling occurs somewhere in the middle when the fish are filleted and no longer easily identifiable

7701699 but were going to show all the doubters what were made of
7701700 he kind of does a little of everything for us
7701701 i think hes the best player ive ever coached everything just comes so natural for him hes definitely a once in a lifetime kind of player
7701702 he had one last year too and it really shows how much he appreciates us
7701703 a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7701704 this pressure initially confined mainly to consumer services such as hospitality and travel has now spread to the professional and business services sector covering areas such as marketing and legal services
7701705 this reflects much tougher trading conditions for business and professional firms after a period when business trends had been holding up in the face of the slowing economy
7701706 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 15 billion us dollars this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
7701707 this report is timely and welcome it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost

7701715 we need to go back to have a conversation about what to do about ward 9 in new orleans rebuild it tear it down you know whatever it is that was john mccains statement when he toured hurricane damaged new orleans recently three days later the senator said he didnt remember saying that
7701716 i wonder if sen mccain has also forgotten his voting record on hurricane katrina a record that suggests that he was part of the problem not part of the solution i trust gulf coast voters wont forget during his recent tour sen mccain criticized both the bush administration and congress for its handling of the disaster lamenting the pace of recovery sen mccain said i want to assure you it will never happen again in this country you have my commitment and my promise but sen mccain voted against establishing a congressional commission to examine the federal state and local responses to katrina in september 2005 he repeated that vote in 2006 he voted against allowing up to 52 weeks of unemployment benefits to people affected by the hurricane and in 2006 voted against appropriating 109 billion in supplemental emergency funding including 28 billion for hurricane relief
7701717 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7701718 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago

7701726 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now
7701727 and i know someone else whos been inspired all over again by senator obama
7701728 a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died

7701783 transform this area with a mainly industrial past to a modern 21st century development that will benefit thousands of local people in terms of providing new affordable housing employment opportunities schools and leisure facilities
7701784 a lot of the younger generation dont know anything about the miners strike or what happened at orgreave history is written by the victors
7701785 its part of our history and i would not be averse to the idea of some sort of plaque while its now known as waverley everybody knows it as orgreave
7701786 we want to leave it to local people to decide
7701787 the miners strike took a lot of forgetting they were not good days and a lot of miners never worked again what we really need to do is forget it
7701788 the coke works was the backdrop to the stand off between margaret thatcher and the national union of miners led by arthur scargill in 1984 known as the battle of orgreave
7701789 this important part of the sites history will be reflected through sensitive reminders so that the community that is created is rooted but not stuck in its past

7701793 the promotion is well deserved and will enable him to do even more to improve the business the way we service our fans the impact we can have on amateur hockey on long island the leadership we show in the community and more
7701794 i know chris well enough that he will stop at nothing less in making the
7701795 beautiful harmonious arrangement in opal red and blue and one of the largest most successful and most popular of the artists justly celebrated bush portraits
7701796 it was not quite the bodys rejection of the defibrillator
7701797 but its a means for a body to cleanse itself of something foreign to it
7701798 not only will the forest initiative revitalise the mary valley timber industry the offsets of up to 850 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions will more than offset the dams estimated 140 000 tonne construction footprint
7701799 it will effectively give the project a better than carbon neutral profile
7701800 developments such as the dam provide an opportunity to deliver additional facilities that provide supplementary benefits for the local community economy and environment
7701801 i can do it this once dont tell anyone i did it and dont forget your id next time
7701802 you have to pay for your coke you have to pay for your coke
7701803 it felt good to get out here and do a little something
7701804 i think you need to weigh whats best for the team in the long run
7701805 you cant make a decision on a one game basis you have to look at the whole season as a whole and make that decision based on that
7701806 i havent really pushed to the point where id be able to tell
7701807 ligaments and cartilage stuff like that you really cant control that
7701808 so i really dont care about that label at all
7701809 im disappointed for our football team but im also disappointed for him
7701810 hes a guy who was on our practice squad most of last year he made it onto the active roster and worked his tail off all offseason and was really having a good camp and had a real strong possibility of making our football team
7701811 therell be a lot of guys that we can look at and well just see what our potential is on our football team and obviously the other people out there
7701812 weve been really pushing him hard to work just to work hard
7701813 that way you dont have to turn it on or try to turn it on in a game thats what you do all the time and hes done that hes really working hard its kind of showing up in the games
7701814 havelocks behavior is shocking and there must be some type of psychological testing
7701815 i am glad that she made the decision to do a psychological evaluation because it was out of character for him
7701816 im just happy the judge is taking the time to set it right
7701817 you have destroyed the futures of my children so now i will reciprocate in kind
7701818 it will be swift and bloody no one destroys my dream no one
7701819 were in the middle of a major drought period and yet we see people still not entirely aware of just how critical our water situation is and we want to highlight our concerns to the minister
7701820 an lnp government will reform our parliament by abolishing the 11 redundant parliamentary secretaries a saving for taxpayers of 3 million per term
7701821 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7701822 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7701823 i mean people think tasmania is this clean green state
7701824 but if they took a drive down into the midlands the bothwell area the east coast and behind oatlands they would see the green but there is absolutely no grass for the stock to eat and there is very little water in water holes
7701825 i believe the report clearly shows expenditure has been kept as low as possible while ensuring that staff do receive the pay rises that they are entitled to
7701826 the timing and number of rrv cases in the darwin area can be very accurately predicted up to one month in advance based on rainfall minimum temperatures and mosquito numbers from our mosquito monitoring program
7701827 this is an excellent tool to more effectively control overall numbers of salt marsh and other mosquitoes as we can perform timely and more efficient spraying of mosquito breeding sites
7701828 it will give us the opportunity to educate people about where virus hotspots are at certain times of the year which will ultimately reduce the number of people who contract rrv

7701833 though it digital marketing is still in the infancy stage here we truly see a lot of potential
7701834 many are already aware of the impact and significance of digital marketing although the mindset of many is still largely traditional when it comes to digital marketing like putting up a web site placing banner adds on certain online sites etc but it has to be more than that
7701835 i committed to being a good partner to making my wife happy to doing my job well and earning a good income to support us and have a family in the next years

7701855 celebrate saratoga wasnt really serving the purpose that a chamber is supposed to serve which is to support and help the businesses grow and prosper
7701856 in years previous celebrate saratoga was the marquee event for saratoga residents had always given us great support for it
7701857 however it has to change it has to be a better event not just for residents but for the greater community
7701858 the youth of this city even my children are night crawlers they only come out after dark
7701859 one of the biggest reasons for the changes was to change the energy of the event and make it more of a pleasant event that appeals more toward the generation with more disposable income
7701860 what were trying to accomplish is to create a better business environment for our members and businesses of saratoga
7701861 so if thats what youre trying to accomplish then having a street dance in the middle of the night is not bringing that client to the city its bringing something else
7701862 the street dance has been a real fundraiser for the chamber because the chamber would not be able to exist without it were taking a big chance here
7701863 cindy is not here today and im sorry shes not

7701874 the bridge is a symbol of a much larger issue it symbolizes the need for renewal
7701875 ive never had someone make this kind of claim the facts are clear the congress street bridge has never been a priority of the city in the end its the citys decision
7701876 he actually has had conversations with congressman shays bill definitely brought it up to him
7701877 it would probably be easier to take the bridge down
7701878 we met with shays personally he stated that it was a waste of money
7701879 it would probably be easier to take the bridge down
7701880 we met with shays personally he stated that it was a waste of money

7701890 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7701891 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practice as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7701892 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7701893 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7701894 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7701895 11 days of global unity a season of interfaith celebration
7701896 wake people up from the destructive dream in which we are currently devouring the planet and to inspire us then to step consciously into a new dream the pursuit of an environmentally sustainable spiritually fulfilling and socially just human presence on this earth
7701897 the invitation to the pachamama alliance from our south american allies was clear if we really want to help them we needed to go to work in our part of the world
7701898 but how do we change the dream of the modern world how do we shift the entire worldview
7701899 if you are ready to be disturbed inspired and moved to action then join us in exploring the most critical concerns of our times
7701900 11 days of global unity a season of interfaith celebration
7701901 the arts council is very pleased with the commitment from individuals to serve on the board we have a board that understands the importance of art and community economic development and is committed to working with the new executive director to make a positive impact
7701902 the need to have an accurate inventory of your businesses fixed assets or your homes contents is essential in todays day and age disasters are happening on a global scale and more people need to be prepared no matter where they live because you cant predict when it will strike you
7701903 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested

7701906 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7701907 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7701908 i was undecided but then i did some checking and learned that barack obama seems to think the same way i do about issues like abortion and the war in iraq and health care and those issues are important to me so i think ill probably vote for him
7701909 gee wouldnt it be convenient to have not had a derailleur at all right now i would still be pedaling instead of standing here on the side of the trail with my hands on my head and my derailleur jammed in my wheel
7701910 personally i never understood the whole take in the scenery thing at trail and mountain race i thought that what hiking was for
7701911 i am running for mayor because it is time for a fresh approach to leadership for our city one that is strongly grounded in electoral and community experience
7701912 i have been a school trustee and for the past six years a city councillor since 2005 i have been one of seven city appointees to the regional district of nanaimo i know and love this community and i am prepared to bring fresh energy and ideas to the job of mayor
7701913 weve accomplished a lot in this community in recent years
7701914 but we can and must do more im going to work hard to become mayor and even harder if i am elected to make that happen
7701915 not indeed for the declaration of any new doctrine of faith but for the direction of human acts
7701916 no one is obliged to believe in a recognized apparition even lourdes and fatima which received the best guarantees an apparition does not have as its function the promotion of a new dogma but to awaken the faith charity and especially hope thomas aquinas stressed these points and that the function of apparitions is essentially prophetic
7701917 the apparitions are only episodes and particular facts in the life of the church they are not at all the essential as are the gospel and the sacraments dogmas and charity they are a contribution a stimulant to the faith and especially to hope as we have seen particular attractions and devotions are left to the discernment of each one in the church which is a place of freedom christians adhere to them according to their affinities and especially according to the inspiration of the holy spirit
7701918 usually get what they expect they become what they believe
7701919 as long as you cant imagine it as long as you cant see it then it is not going to happen for you
7701920 god wants to increase you financially by giving you promotions fresh ideas and creativity
7701921 indeed i count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing christ jesus my lord for his sake i have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order that i may gain christ
7701922 the idea here is to encourage foreign companies to come to the philippines instead
7701923 we are thinking of one visa for every 10 filipinos hired
7701924 the bi is absolutely serious in creating a climate friendly to legitimate and responsible foreign businessmen who intend to bring into the philippines financial capital and technology
7701925 step in the right direction in gaining the interest and trust of foreign investors
7701926 i know something that affects you but i cant tell you
7701927 i will build my church and all the powers of hell will not conquer it matthew 16 18
7701928 but when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit upon his glorious throne
7701929 come you who are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world for i was hungry and you fed me i was thirsty and you gave me a drink i was a stranger and you invited me into your home i was naked and you gave me clothing i was sick and you cared for me i was in prison and you visited me
7701930 lord when did we ever see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink or a stranger and show you hospitality or naked and give you clothing when did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you
7701931 i tell you the truth when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters you were doing it to me
7701932 away with you you cursed ones into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons for i was hungry and you didnt feed me i was thirsty and you didnt give me a drink i was a stranger and you didnt invite me into your home i was naked and you didnt give me clothing i was sick and in prison and you didnt visit me
7701933 lord when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not help you
7701934 i tell you the truth when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters you were refusing to help me
7701935 we are g chatting with obama volunteers from all over the state
7701936 world wide mind the coming integration of humans and machines
7701937 i am very concerned by the impact of dumping twelve tons of hazardous air pollutants annually together with a yearly release of another sixteen and a half tons of volatile organic compounds
7701938 every environmental tool available to protect the residents and tourists of myrtle beach
7701939 i would also request that the epa accept this proposed release as a violation of the clean air act
7701940 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
7701941 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
7701942 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
7701943 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
7701944 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
7701945 its not uncommon to see trees turning colors sometimes even later than the first week of november
7701946 in the fall the leaves of the tree turn beautiful shades of pink and magenta
7701947 coming in and out of yosemite either on highway 41 from the south or highway 120 from the northwest there are a lot of dogwood trees right next to the highway
7701948 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
7701949 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
7701950 near the coast is the last place youll find color

7701967 if they werent muslim theyd look like one of the biggest catholic churches youd ever seen from an organizational standpoint
7701968 i think theyre even working on their first eagle scout
7701969 a certain kind of sophisticated thinking is now beginning to emerge because people who were born in the u s are taking over

7701971 of the potential 35 prayers you have in a week for 34 there will be only about 30 people but for that one friday prayer there will be like a thousand people showing up
7701972 where do they park they park on the road they park here they park there the prayer starts exactly on time every day so it becomes a huge bottleneck of space and time
7701973 if somebody wants to operate a program within our mission and vision they can do it
7701974 a free market of ideas and activities thats not centrally controlled
7701975 theyre not saying were going to send people and create a new mosque or plant an independent church

7701978 we offer events that arent just one persons vision what we give is something that is formally approved by a committee

7702002 now if he came to where im from which is the inner city liberty city in miami i was the three time charles hadley pool champ
7702003 wouldnt that buttress a class action lawsuit why is edwards taking care of his fat cat bundlers but not reimbursing joe lunchbuckets 100 troubling
7702004 it seems that john edwards is giving much of his money back to the
7702005 this would have been a real scoop if big contributors were getting refunds but little contributors werent after edwards confessed to his affair the true explanation appears to be pretty mundane
7702006 if the candidate drops out after the primaries then all contributions designated for the general election not the primary election then the contributions by law have to be refunded to the contributors if the individual contributor wants a refund of his her donation made for the primary election its up to the discretion of the campaign whether to make the refund
7702007 there might be plenty of trial lawyers that supported john edwards willing to take that class action case

7702024 laws go through all kinds of markups changes and amendments
7702025 the process has evolved from making those changes on parchment to at least using word processing documents but its not that big a step to think of moving to the next generation of tools and crafting a whole piece of legislation on a wiki
7702026 like most it managers you face a choice when it comes to operating systems not long ago you might have turned to windows solaris or unix but now linux has your undivided attention why is linux an open source operating system seeing such rapid adoption and growth more importantly why should you consider it for your own growing business compared to other platforms linux offers maximum flexibility lower costs tight security powerful performance ongoing innovation in organizations large and small linux is becoming the clear choice for enterprise computing

7702030 the second is a declaration on a strategic cooperation between the united states and poland
7702031 this capability will be very important to our nato allies for their security just as its very important for the united states and poland
7702032 as if on cue the iranians just in the last couple of weeks have launched a space launch vehicle which again demonstrates additional capabilities and underscores the concerns we have about the growing missile threat from countries like iran
7702033 its not limited to iran i should hasten to add but its certainly an additional matter
7702034 we also talked about the desire of the united states and poland to pursue cooperation involving air and missile defense cooperation
7702035 well begin those deployments once of course we reach the necessary agreements with the poles and that could begin next year
7702036 and then we set the goal of establishing a garrison for the u s army patriot battery in poland by the year 2012
7702037 its a pretty broad coverage in terms of the subject matter in that document and i think its befitting of the fact that this is going to be a substantially changed relationship between the united states and poland in that you will have a much greater level of defense cooperation
7702038 i think its common knowledge you see a school bus and you know theres kids involved
7702039 people just have to wake up when theyre driving everybody loves to run stop lights and stop signs now theyre running on the side of the bus
7702040 for a school bus violation its a must appear you must see the judge and the typical fine from the city court is 145 for that violation
7702041 a license plate number obviously very helpful and almost a must so we can track down the vehicle and also a description of the driver of the vehicle
7702042 the size of the classes will be a concern this year theres no doubt about it we will have more classes that are over the recommended standard by state more than weve had for several years

7702049 i asked what would happen if she was a repeat handstand offender and he said that would be defiance and it could lead to her being suspended
7702050 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 15 billion us dollars this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
7702051 this report is timely and welcome it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost
7702052 this pressure initially confined mainly to consumer services such as hospitality and travel has now spread to the professional and business services sector covering areas such as marketing and legal services
7702053 this reflects much tougher trading conditions for business and professional firms after a period when business trends had been holding up in the face of the slowing economy

7702087 in the meantime we are just grateful for the efforts of the firefighters and the m amp i employees
7702088 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7702089 i wish i could see them again and thank them for their help
7702090 i remember them saying they heard the boys screaming when they drove by so they turned around and jumped out and grabbed the kids
7702091 for them to react that way and to retain their composure and to go in there and do it safely it was a gamble because the truck was already on fire and to get that close to it they were risking their own lives to do it i just think its amazing what they did
7702092 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7702093 we really dont know what exactly it is we are depending on the finding of a team of specialists from new delhi
7702094 a lot of people can still be saved we need doctors
7702095 everyone here is waiting for doctors to come and examine people but they arent coming and we are counting our dead
7702096 its your fault for leaving it to the last minute
7702097 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision agarwalla said
7702098 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7702099 this is americas convention and were using new technology this time like text messaging and google and youtube to really break down these walls to make this convention more open and interactive
7702100 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7702101 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7702102 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
7702103 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7702104 it means that it will be something that the family would be happy to hear at this point
7702105 were not taking it lightly that i can assure you of
7702106 no matter what i become what i achieve what i make out of my life i always wanna run back to you and tell look sweetheart i got a first grade
7702107 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac
7702108 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7702109 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7702110 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support
7702111 that sends the message to the kremlin that it risks international isolation
7702112 mr cheney is widely viewed by the russian political elite as the toughest hawk on russia in the bush administration
7702113 it hasnt gone unanswered in fact id say its been loudly answered
7702114 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7702115 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7702116 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7702117 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream
7702118 we spend our time in a condominium in washington a condominium in phoenix some time over here in the state of california and then we have a place up in northern arizona
7702119 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7702120 the white house was saved by the action of one brave soldier john mccain
7702121 i know youve been asking about who i want to be my running mate
7702122 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time
7702123 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7702124 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7702125 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7702126 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7702127 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7702128 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7702129 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7702130 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7702131 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7702132 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7702133 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7702134 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7702135 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7702136 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7702137 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7702138 michelle ma belle sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble tres bien ensemble

7702149 wasted away again in margaritaville searching for my outlaw shaker of salt
7702150 its frustrating because i want to be here and help the team but for me not being 100 percent to go out there its not just hurting the team its me not being 100 percent
7702151 i was told nothing could make it worse which is why i wanted to pitch through it it just hasnt gone away
7702152 weve all seen john maine even without his best stuff if im not mistaken he had a pretty good game in pittsburgh
7702153 but the bottom line is we cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race which means that guys are going to have to step up
7702154 well watch him play watch him perform watch the level the team is playing at with him performing and see where we are
7702155 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7702156 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7702157 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
7702158 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism

7702164 het was goed om er een punt achter te zetten
7702165 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac
7702166 recebi do ex prefeito a cidade com a sa de em situa o triste

7702168 s depois da decreta o do estado de emerg ncia a sa de come ou a melhorar
7702169 o que falta para a sa de de salvador um bom gerenciamento
7702170 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
7702171 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
7702172 there may be five jars and they look just beautiful and you sniff em and then youre dumb enough to take a bite
7702173 you just want to die its 90 degrees in the room nothing in sight to drink and youve got four jars to go
7702174 maybe the family taste buds became accustomed to it but when home rendered lard becomes rancid and is mixed and heated it is not delicious
7702175 rancid butter is not delicious rancid nuts are not delicious butter that sits around too long is not delicious
7702176 but when you have dozens and dozens of cookies in each category
7702177 i love bread and butter pickles but there are years youll open every jar and theres not a crispy one in the bunch
7702178 its wonderful and it can be heartbreaking believe me ive tasted some apple pies that were heartbreaking
7702179 you can almost tell the professionals because the cakes look so perfect
7702180 ill see one thats lopsided and i can tell that maybe it was done by a you hope those are good youd love for them to get a ribbon
7702181 theres nothing more frustrating than hearing a clerk say im out of carbon paper
7702182 thats just the way the system works unfortunately its very frustrating
7702183 i just want to ask the court to give me a second chance
7702184 he killed a child and he spent a year in jail he has violated his probation twice and hes still not going to prison
7702185 you dont learn a lesson by only going to jail for a year
7702186 heres the thing the original script had him as irish but then there was the first trailer where he plays an irishman and i thought whats the stretch for an irishman to play an irishman so why isnt he australian and then you have an australian you have an african american you have him disguised as a vietnamese and in the beginning of the movie you see him as an irishman a very gay irishman
7702187 because it was my goal for there to be nothing stereotypical except for when the story demands that hes momentarily specifically stereotypical for which the actual black man puts him in his place so the funny thing about this in retrospect looking at how we did this and decisions that were made and all that is that i remember that we had discussions and then the talk is over and youre out there shooting a f king movie and so my idea was to try and be natural and entertaining
7702188 i just think that the australian phenomenon reminds me more of american as with the british invasion from the 60s but when i was thinking about kirk lazarus i was thinking about colin farrell about daniel day lewis and about russell crowe and whoever was the most effective tool for whatever my thing was i would use
7702189 now do you think he would see it as the highest form of flattery or do you think that he would be less than pleased
7702190 himself too seriously i think his fatal flaw is pretty much any and everyones whos in entertainment which is on a certain level oh if they believe theyre a fraud and thats creating this neurotic state when the truth is you are a fraud because youve gone too far into buying into your own hype and now youre literally crazy i think kirk lazarus is nuts
7702191 i dont often say that i know how things are going to go but i did know that iron man was going to come out and be received and have the kind of success it did so it wasnt surprising but gratifying because it would have been very disappointing if my feeling and my intuition about it hadnt been met by reality as is often the case
7702192 i think its like anything at a certain point favreau and i were invited to a dinner at a chinese restaurant in beverly hills and i felt like they opened the books and we were made guys there was a lot of like power players there and studio people and that we were sitting and we left and i felt like we i feel like we were just like mafia they just made us it was this weird thing too because i dont know if any of us had this experience but sometimes you go from being in one position to being in another or you have a certain sense of achievement and theres this kind of energy that happens where there literally is an energetic transformation then the next day you wake up and its just another day
7702193 iron man 2 is a topic of conversation as he and favreau are currently collaborating on a story for the much anticipated sequel
7702194 now justin theraux who wrote tropic thunder is writing it and jon and i are working on the story with him its pretty great and i think its going to be cool i think its going to appropriately well thought out so that we dont forget what got us the response that we appreciated so much which is we didnt say great now that this is like this now were going to twist it and do this with it its now im not saying were going to do bits i think more of the same it is a very rich feel because it was a very simple movie if you ask me it was an origin story
7702195 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
7702196 you know youre never too old to burn your bridges because i believe i have offended everyone
7702197 i think ive got a couple more ill burn that bridge when i come to it is my favourite phrase ive ever coined
7702198 iron man 2 and the starring role in british director guy ritchies take on sherlock holmes
7702199 its definitely going to be guy ritchies take and its going to be done in classical 1891 surroundings but not going to be particularly stylised
7702200 i think whats contemporary about it is that you go back to the real truth of sherlock holmes is that hes a lot more broad and less stoic than i remember seeing him depicted hes a bare knuckle boxer a martial artist and a complete weirdo which is why i said id love to do this

7702277 in 50 years of interviews jerry siegel never once mentioned that his father died in a robbery
7702278 your father dies in a robbery and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the worlds greatest hero im sorry but theres a story there
7702279 america did not get superman from our greatest legends but because a boy lost his father
7702280 superman came not out of our strength but out of our vulnerability
7702281 supermans invulnerability to bullets loss of family destruction of his homeland all seem to overlap with jerrys personal experience theres a connection there the loss of a dad as a source for superman
7702282 i believe i have the first accurate account jerrys father wasnt shot and robbed he had a heart attack during a robbery
7702283 had no pensions no contracts no health benefits and companies didnt even pay for the artists supplies when these artists tried to negotiate greater rights for themselves they were either collectively cast out or made false promises
7702284 having their names listed as supermans creators was the biggest victory of all
7702285 kurt vonnegut jules pfeiffer will eisner eli wallach and his wife were there
7702286 walter cronkite came on and they showed superman flying and he described what had happened at the end he said another triumph for truth justice and the american way

7702307 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could and the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7702308 this is the first match of the final round and it is very important i chose these 20 players who are able to fight in hot weather and understand the concept of the team very well

7702340 el presupuesto tal cual hoy est planteado en la universidad no alcanza nosotros creemos que la universidad debe redefinir el aporte que hace a la escuela
7702341 viene desde hace varios a os es m s desde hace tiempo que no se hace mantenimiento del edificio la crisis es estructural
7702342 primero se dej de hacer mantenimiento de comprar equipamiento se fue decayendo en cuanto a la cobertura de cargos parecer a que nuestras autoridades no advirtieron que la escuela se est cayendo
7702343 no podemos tener solvencia econ mica si no hay equipamiento cuando uno trae chicos del rea rural y ve que no se puede brindar todo lo que uno pretender a brindarle a su hijo indudablemente que algo est fallando
7702344 deb amos 30 mil pesos e hicimos un convenio de pago de 10 mil pesos cada 15 d as pudimos cumplir los dos primeros pagos y el tercer pago no pudimos afrontar adem s de las facturas que tenemos y que no podemos afrontar
7702345 cont bamos con 30 vacas y tenemos para darle comida a entre 15 y 20 animales por eso debemos reducir la cantidad de vacas no solamente estamos haciendo la reducci n porque no tenemos alimento para los animales sino tambi n porque tenemos cortadas las cuentas con los proveedores y debemos sacrificar animales para darle de comer carne a nuestros alumnos que asisten al comedor nos estamos descapitalizando

7702357 what about abraham you believe in him and how he tried to sacrifice his son for god
7702358 what about the other prophets david solomon and john the baptist
7702359 do you believe in jesus that he was the christ of god
7702360 o god if you are there guide me guide me
7702361 thats ok give me your back pack ill put it in the car
7702362 im taking your back pack up to the school since it is so heavy you have to walk your back pack will be in the school office and you better hurry otherwise you are going to be late
7702363 if you were driving the back pack up why didnt you drive your son as well
7702364 oh you poor thing please dont worry about this quiz today in science you can take it tomorrow when your not so exhausted
7702365 your mother drove your back pack to school and not you man your mother is mean you are soho cool
7702366 when you have two or three weeks of rain it was like monsoon season in vietnam people just dont come out
7702367 this last week is going to give an opportunity to people whove only been up here once who usually come two or three times to come up a couple times
7702368 given that we limped out of the gate for the first couple weeks due to the weather i think this will put a nice punctuation point on the meet

7702379 since speaker pelosi has in her words studied the issue
7702380 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude
7702381 i have no hand in the day to day operations of my mother and sisters business and receive no income from the business
7702382 leonard lance knows full well that i have always paid my own taxes in full it is shameful that leonard lance and the republican party are attacking my 80 year old mother and sisters small business particularly at a time when small businesses throughout new jersey are struggling to make ends meet i have seen up close how the bush economy has devastated businesses that had been surviving and thriving for decades since my fathers death my mother and sister have been struggling to keep the 35 year old business afloat yet they have always paid their taxes in full their situation shows urgently why we need change in washington to get our economy moving again

7702413 can we box up your food we have a 6 30 pm reservation
7702414 i saw god when he took away my fear of trotting
7702415 i saw god in the breath of my horse and heard his voice on the wind
7702416 i saw god in the trust of a wild mustang for a new person
7702417 i saw god in the healing of the abused horses
7702418 at this time of sadness i ask the priests of the archeparchy as soon as possible at a time convenient for them to celebrate a commemorative divine liturgy for the repose of the soul of bishop walter paska
7702419 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7702420 it was harder and harder for us to justify giving that premium
7702421 fatally defective to describe the latest indictment bonds attorneys argue that baseballs all time home run king cannot defend himself because many of the perjury allegations are too vague
7702422 what a bunch of sore losers i didnt win the book either but im not here whining about the test questions
7702423 msnbc has turned into a commentary for liberals and they dont even try to be non biased
7702424 i just think this is really exciting to a see a work plan and a scope
7702425 we feel that selling the edited register is an unsatisfactory way for local authorities to treat personal information
7702426 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
7702427 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
7702428 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7702429 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
7702430 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
7702431 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
7702432 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7702433 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
7702434 jumping in the 20 nationwide car this year was a big step for me in the beginning of the season
7702435 you can jump with a great team have a little bit more pressure and run up front or you can run a middle to the back team not have the pressure to run up front but youre not going to win races
7702436 you could see right then that he was just very very consistent hitting his marks and running the same lap times with the car that he had
7702437 i think the biggest thing is that hes very open minded hes not afraid to move around hell take what he has and do the best with it
7702438 from what weve done so far its been a lot of fun and its been energizing to start over and have to start thinking differently and having to react differently
7702439 overall i think hes done a phenomenal job in everything weve asked him to do so far
7702440 im not concerned about his age at all the proof will be in his ability to drive to run hard and to win
7702441 it could be a quarter midget legend car race whatever it is ok
7702442 the kid can take it he can do the job it is not like he is trying to do more the hype is only there because he has done it he can do it and he has done it that is the only reason the hype is there it will not break him the hype wont break him the kid can do it
7702443 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it i think its cool when tony stewart left and they brought my name up it was really exciting for me especially as an 18 year old kid
7702444 its cool even to have your name brought up but then for it all to happen and if we all work good then its going to be really exciting
7702445 we went into it open minded we asked him what do you think about the 20 car do you want a veteran guy to serve time with you you could race two thirds of the races and we would bring you up slow or we could wait a year and you could run a season in the nationwide series
7702446 then his dad said let joey talk he did he stood straight up and said heres what i think my experience is im not afraid of these cars ive been in em i understand the big cars he wasnt cocky he just thought if someone else was running the races it would take away from the laps he had he felt the best experience for him was to get in and drive the race cars rather than sitting on the sidelines
7702447 the good thing about joey is that the mother and the daddy have been there the whole time
7702448 thats 18 years of being at the house with him
7702449 the advantage we have with joey is his parents looked after him for 18 years and hes very experienced for his age hes been in tons of cars raced lots of places hes been at big cup practices dealing with the best people in the world and next week at richmond will be another building page in his book
7702450 chubby hubby is an asshole for drinking all the milk and not getting anymore forgive him

7702455 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7702456 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
7702457 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature

7702462 vorige week zondag wilde mijn moeder niet meer eten en drinken ze kon haar bed niet meer uit ze hief zich voortdurend een stukje op uit haar kussens en kon daar niet meer mee stoppen ook kon ze geen moment

7702467 if apple applied ssl encryption in the browser it would only slow down every data exchange without really improving security and instead only provide pundits with a false sense of security that distracts from real security threats
7702468 but there is a gap between this understanding and the translation into action especially when it comes to united nations security council resolutions
7702469 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
7702470 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
7702471 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf

7702473 i just think this is really exciting to a see a work plan and a scope
7702474 celebrate saratoga wasnt really serving the purpose that a chamber is supposed to serve which is to support and help the businesses grow and prosper
7702475 in years previous celebrate saratoga was the marquee event for saratoga residents had always given us great support for it
7702476 however it has to change it has to be a better event not just for residents but for the greater community
7702477 the youth of this city even my children are night crawlers they only come out after dark
7702478 one of the biggest reasons for the changes was to change the energy of the event and make it more of a pleasant event that appeals more toward the generation with more disposable income
7702479 what were trying to accomplish is to create a better business environment for our members and businesses of saratoga
7702480 so if thats what youre trying to accomplish then having a street dance in the middle of the night is not bringing that client to the city its bringing something else
7702481 the street dance has been a real fundraiser for the chamber because the chamber would not be able to exist without it were taking a big chance here
7702482 and then they would do it again it was sadly amusing and then they made everyone clap after the whole spectacle was finished
7702483 the chuppah wedding canopy is intended to create an intimate space symbolizing the home that the bride and groom will share together the sides are left open to signify that all friends and family are welcome into their new life and home the roof of our chuppah is a quilt created by jesses mother incorporating ties belonging to jesses father

7702485 ang retrieval contract sa removal ng hazardous waste isang buwan sana maging maayos ang panahon para mapabilis ito the contract gives the firm a month to retrieve the toxic cargo we hope this will go well

7702487 may mga nakuha kaming impormasyon kung saan nanggagaling ang pondo ng milf we received information reports on where the milfs money is coming from

7702490 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7702491 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7702492 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7702493 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7702494 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7702495 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7702496 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here

7702501 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7702502 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
7702503 were going to work very hard to defeat this because it is just bad policy for children

7702523 the minutemen are coming off back to back conference titles they were hit hard by graduation but return a ton of talent including quarterback
7702524 i think that once this convention is over obama will have a big bounce from that
7702525 there are unaffiliated voters who volunteered to help with this convention and there are probably a lot who signed up for those tickets to get into invesco field
7702526 so i think this is a chance for us to highlight who barack obama is what this ticket is and most importantly all the polling ive been shown is that hes running way way ahead among unaffiliated voters ahead of mccain
7702527 i dont think its a good thing to have both your president and vice president between them have 11 homes at a time when were in a housing crisis
7702528 as a doctor and legislator im always working to help families make their lives better
7702529 but it doesnt take a doctor to see congress is making things worse
7702530 when it comes time for election ill let someone else take it over ive got plenty on my plate
7702531 russia intends to inform various wto partners of its withdrawal from accords that contradict its interests
7702532 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7702533 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7702534 a significant number will come out of editorial i think they say therell be about 120 jobs lost out of editorial
7702535 from what we see of their statements so far most of those will come out of the age and the sydney morning herald
7702536 to think you can do that without undermining the quality of those papers i think defies belief
7702537 the back story on this is that a girl named olga was out with her friends in the marina district of san francisco known for being a popular hang out for douches and she talked to this guy named dmitri for all of two minutes
7702538 katakanlah kepada hamba hambaku yang telah bertindak melampaui batas terhadap diri mereka sendiri janganlah kamu berputus harapan dari rahmat allah sesungguhnya allah bersedia mengampunkan semua dosa sesungguhnya dialah yang maha pengampun dan maha pengasih
7702539 dan kembalilah kepada tuhanmu dan serahlah diri kamu kepadanya sebelum azab menimpa kamu dan selepas itu kamu tidak akan ditolong lagi dan ikutilah al quran sebaik baik hidayat yang diturunkan kepada kamu dari tuhan kamu sebelum azab menimpa kamu secara mendadak sedangkan kamu tidak sedar
7702540 sebelum azab menimpa kamu dan selepas itu kamu tidak akan di tolong lagi
7702541 dan ikutilah al quran sebaik baik hidayat yang diturunkan kepada kamu dari tuhan kamu sebelum azab menimpa kamu secara mendadak sedangkan kamu tidak sedar
7702542 supaya jangan ada seseorang pun yang akan bersungut alangkah sesalnya aku terhadap perbuatanku yang telah mencuaikan kewajipan terhadap allah dan sesungguhnya aku dahulunya dari orang orang yang mempersenda sendakan ajaran allah
7702543 atau supaya jangan ada yang berkata jika allah telah memberi hidayat kepadaku tentulah aku termasuk dalam golongan para muttaqin
7702544 atau supaya jangan ada yang berkata ketika ia melihat azab alangkah beruntungnya jika aku dapat pulang semua ke dunia supaya aku termasuk dalam golongan muhsinin
7702545 sadly i think this is probably linked with the current society where litigation is rife and i feel that schools are probably trying to avoid a child being hurt and an irresponsible mother then trying to sue them for it
7702546 the issue around the gymnastics is around the safety of the kids and it was not motivated by any concept of litigation
7702547 so you fall on your head well thats a given and you get up and do it again
7702548 the farmer wants a wife phenomenon is very real in these places
7702549 years ago it was the case that a woman in those areas might have been married to the guy next door by the age they are 21 and having kids by the time theyre 23 but thats just not the case anymore
7702550 instead weve seen a generation thats very mobile that is interested in obtaining a tertiary education who want to live in the big cities travel and do all those things that were beyond the reach of their parents
7702551 ive been cooked and roasted and carved up i dont have a hair left on my body

7702553 theres nothing holding it together other than ambition and opportunism its reason for being is to win the next election and if it doesnt its likely to fall over
7702554 it is a sense of pride for me looking at denver compared to where it was 20 to 25 years ago
7702555 there is a process going on here turning this state from red to green blue
7702556 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls

7702572 jullie horen binnekort wel of jullie hier moeten blijven tot die tijd kunnen jullie je maar beter rustig houden
7702573 dat zal niet gebeuren jij hebt echter wel enkele grove fouten gemaakt
7702574 nou een wijze agent heeft nooit een echte stropdas om
7702575 en een wijze agent gaat nooit in de buurt van de celtralies staan
7702576 een wijze agent draagt altijd een nepstropdas die kan dan losklikken als iemand die vast grijpt maarja dit leer je spelenderwijs toch

7702578 je hoeft je niet te verontschuldigen mario mijn broer ik ben blij je weer te zien
7702579 luister broer er is veel gaande in mijn wereld ik weet dat we ongemakkelijk uit elkaar gingen maar ik vind dat we weer vrede moeten sluiten ik weet dat je last hebt gehad met de kitano jongens de laatste tijd en ik neem je niet kwalijk voor iets daarvan ze zijn weer in opkomst ik heb drie dagen terug vernomen dat horishi en sumi in schiphol geland zijn ze verbreken hiermee alle ongeschreven regels ze willen oorlog mario en jij zit er midden in

7702583 nderbreken dit programma voor een nieuwsbericht er is een lichaam van een veertig jarige italiaanse man aangetroffen in de kelder van een fietsenmaker in utrecht we gaan gaan nu direct naar onze verslaggever david boogske voor een live verslag
7702584 dank je ik sta hier niet ver van de plaats van de misdaad vandaan de politieagenten houden iedereen tegen ook de pers heeft geen toegang en informatie willen ze niet geven het enige wat wij weten is dat het slachtoffer rond de 40 jaar oud was en op onnatuurlijke wijze om het leven gekomen is ze proberen nu zo ving ik op uit een gesprek tussen twee forensisch onderzoekers moord uit te sluiten de sfeer is grimmig en van de geringe openheid van de politie daalt onze verwachting op een zelfmoordactie ook weinig mensen zullen het zich waarschijnlijk herinneren maar 12 jaar geleden is hier een soortgelij
7702585 of was dat roodkleurige vet wat hij van zijn handen veegde geen vet het sterfgeval kan sowieso niet lang geleden gebeurt zijn als we hem daar net nog zagen staan de politie is dus ingelicht dit zou wijzen op een moord want bij zelfdoding ga je de politie niet bellen
7702586 maar als het een moord was waarom geeft de politie dit dan niet toe immers weten zij het ook zij hebben per slot van rekening de hoogstwaarschijnlijk anonieme tip ontvangen
7702587 precies dit zou betekenen dat hun verwachting niet liggen op een crime passionnel maar een moord met voorbedachte rade
7702588 zouden ze de feiten niet dusdanig voor het publiek waaronder immers de dader zich mogelijk bevind verborgen houden
7702589 we waren hier kortgeleden nog de fietsenmaker stond toen daar buiten
7702590 op een grote paddenstoel rood met witte stippen zat kabouter spillebeen yadda yadda yadda alleen omdat niks op ging behalve het rood met witte stippen lied ik dat maar weg

7702624 whoever accompanies the funeral procession of a muslim out of sincere faith and anticipation for allahs reward and remains with it till the funeral prayer is offered and the burial ceremonies are over will return with a reward of two carats each carat is like the size of mount uhud he who offers the funeral prayer only and returns before the burial will return with the reward of one carat only
7702625 verily any deed you do in which you sincerely seek allahs pleasure will raise you in ranks and honor
7702626 learn your intentions for they are more important than the deeds themselves
7702627 i would not be pleased if my house was next to mosque i want my footpath to the mosque and my return to be written in my records
7702628 and i went to him and said why dont you buy a donkey to avoid the heat and the insects of earth he said by allah i would not even wish to have my house next door of the muhammads house so i actually dragged him all the way until we reached the prophet may peace and blessings be upon him and i told him what the man said and the prophet called the man and told him that he will get what he hoped for you shall be given what you have anticipated said the prophet may peace and blessings be upon him
7702629 say as they say means the muazeneen if you finish then supplicate and allah will answer you
7702630 if you hear the athan reply the call of allah
7702631 if the muslim performs the ablution his sins will get out from his ears his eyes his hands and his feet so if he finishes he will be forgiven
7702632 the ablution is half of the faith of a believer narrated by muslim
7702633 three things performing a perfect ablution during the hard times like cold walking to the mosques and waiting for the prayer after the prayer all those three expiate you from sins completely narrated by abu yaala and al hakim al baihaqi and corrected by al albani 926 in sahih al jamei
7702634 only the believer will remain with his ablution sustaining it at all times narrated by ibn majah at tabarani and corrected by al albani 953 in sahih al jamei
7702635 my people will be called on the day of resurrection and they will be ghuraran muhajaleen with a special mark as a result of their ablution
7702636 siwak is a purification for the mouth and satisfaction for the lord
7702637 if i had not found it hard for my followers or the people i would have ordered them to clean their teeth with siwak for every prayer and to make ablution before each prayer
7702638 if anyone amongst you performs the ablution and then completes the ablution well and then says i testify that there is no god but allah and that muhammad is the servant of allah and his messenger the eight gates of paradise would be opened for him and he may enter by whichever of them he wishes
7702639 whoever performs the ablution and said how perfect is allah and i praise you i bear witness that there is no god but you ask your forgiveness and turn to you in repentance this will be written and then will be kept in a container which will never be broken until the day of judgment

7702644 there are 35 reasons to impeach the president and she is not allowing any of them to move forward
7702645 we are all a country and a party that honors freedom of expression
7702646 arent we proud of the effective and historic race run by hillary rodham clinton if a woman can run for president and the american people are ready for a woman to run for president we desperately need many more women in politics

7702648 despite turbulent markets our investment and development divisions were able to produce stable income streams demonstrating the quality of the investment portfolio and the strong demand for our leading residential products outgoing chief executive greg paramor said
7702649 while we are in a constrained residential market across australia investors and homebuyers are continuing to support quality residential developments as evidenced by our record sales achievements in queensland and western australia
7702650 our results and recent announcements to the market show that mirvac is a robust organisation that is able to adapt to changed market conditions
7702651 residential developments have been exposed to the continuing poor sentiment affordability and mortgage related stress which adversely impacted some development values mirvac said

7702655 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7702656 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average human per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms
7702657 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7702658 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7702659 these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption
7702660 i think giving a nice chunk of fish to a pet is important to satisfy the personal hedonistic needs of the owner not the nutritional need of the cat
7702661 cats will be very happy to eat the offal from a trout
7702662 we can use these data to highlight the need for international agreements to protect this threatened species
7702663 we just adapted that from white spots on a black night sky to white spots on the flank of a whale shark
7702664 provides the opportunity for thousands of nonscientists to become involved and make a meaningful contribution to wildlife conservation
7702665 we can identify bears from year to year so we can start looking at do things change with the bears
7702666 are we seeing the same individuals coming into the area year upon year do we see a change in how long they stay in the tourist area there are a lot of questions you can ask if the technology works
7702667 it would be a noninvasive way of answering questions about the sunfish in the gal pagos for example we could start to decipher if this is a resident population or not
7702668 they have spotting on their head that doesnt appear to change as they age which is the necessary requirement to use the technique
7702669 rather than having people diving with these giant sharks we have people fishing for giant trout
7702670 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile chief executive david kirk said in a statement
7702671 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7702672 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions he said
7702673 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7702674 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year
7702675 the us indicated that this was less than the amount of radio activity found in a common smoke detector and would not have any adverse effect on human health marine life or the environment
7702676 the safety limits are set by our national environmental agency centre of radiation protection and nuclear science while the uss houston was in singapore in 2006 the imes did not show any abnormal readings
7702677 less than the amount found in a common smoke detector
7702678 confident that there was no adverse impact on public health marine life or the environment
7702679 potential exposure to the reported leak is 100 000 times less than exposure from natural radiation in a year
7702680 so low that it was below the threshold that it was designed to detect
7702681 this suggested that the uss houston could have been leaking during her port call at changi naval base in september 2006
7702682 to put things into perspective the us indicated that this was less than the amount of radioactivity found in a common smoke detector and would not have any adverse effect on human health marine life or the environment

7702692 as election speculation hits fever pitch the harper government has cut loose a contentious private members bill that would have made it a crime to take the life of a fetus justice minister rob nicholson announced monday that the government will draft a new bill to replace bill c 484 the unborn victims of crime act so that it closes the debate about fetal rights and focuses instead on penalizing criminals who harm pregnant women
7702693 weve heard criticism from across the country including representatives of the medical community that mr epps bill as presently drafted could be interpreted as instilling fetal rights let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7702694 for this reason im announcing that the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but

7702710 there still seems to be a fair bit of interest from a political point of view
7702711 anything that would reduce the cost of shipping would have a beneficial impact on manufacturers by providing more cash flow which is pretty scarce today

7702814 mccabe said madison has changed greatly since he first began working there in 1981 he said the way politics is done in 2008 would be unrecognizable compared to 1981 politics the culprit said mccabe is the large amount of money in politics especially the large amount of dollars going to political action committees pals organizations that take donations without having to disclose their sources while political candidates are required to disclose all of their donations and the law restricts how much individuals can give to each candidate mccabe repeatedly used wisconsin manufacturers amp commerce wmc as an example
7702815 in later comments state sen bob jauch said more democrats are needed in madison to bring about needed reform jauch was asked if the democratically controlled u s legislature senate and house had created any significant campaign reform after gaining control in 2006 jauch was unable to mention any federal reform he did direct some angry comments at wmc which has placed issue ads against jauch he said the wmc acted like the ku klux klan in bullying candidates take the hoods off jauch said of the wmc
7702816 theyve got eight starters back on defense and their defense everybody talks about clemsons offense and they do have great skill players but defensively there were ranked in the top 10 in most categories last year they were 10th in scoring defense turnover margin which is always important in winning and losing they were one of the top teams in the country i think they were ninth in turnover margin so this is a very good all around team
7702817 now obviously the team that we play is going to be a tremendous test for us
7702818 on special teams theyve got both their specialists back and theyve been very sound and solid on special teams
7702819 practice preparation went well on friday and saturday from an injury standpoint
7702820 nick fanuzzi has been talking to us for several days and hes decided to transfer nick is a fine young man he did an outstanding job here for us we certainly hate to see him leave the program because every characteristic every value that we try to instill in the program he certainly represents hes a great team player and did a really good job here and were sorry to see him go but at the same time we wish him well and we will help him every way that we can get some place where he feels he has a better opportunity to compete we wish him and his family both well
7702821 first of all julio did an outstanding job coming in here in camp he worked hard in the summer he was in good shape hes been able to sustain his performance hes consistently made plays in practice as well as both scrimmages and i think probably after the first scrimmage it was pretty evident that he was going to have some role as one of the three receivers that we use quite a bit and i think this last week he certainly solidified his position as a starter he and mike mccoy have been our two best receivers throughout this camp in terms of consistency how theyve competed how many plays theyve made so those two guys deserve to be the starters and he probably solidified that position this past week in practice
7702822 were going to use him on kickoff returns some with javier arenas but i think we have some other guys that we can use in that role he does a really good job of fielding the ball on punts so he is the back up punt returner right now marquis maze has worked back there we have other players such as b j scott who have worked back there and who we will continue to develop as returners but right now if we played the game today he would go in there as the back up punt return guy
7702823 i think the first thing thats important is when theyve struggled to run the ball and make big plays thats when theyve had the least amount of success offensively even though they are a very balanced offensive team and they have a tremendous ability to make big plays throwing the football the whole synergy of their teams seems to center around those guys making great plays theyre also good pass receivers so its not like theyre void in the passing game but i think its pretty easy to show the defensive players that if we stop the run in this game this is going to give us the best chance to be successful on defense i think our players have a tremendous amount of respect for both these guys and what they do well we just have to prepare to do a good job of keeping leverage and staying in our gaps and tackling well and those are the things that usually contribute to being able to stop good runners and you certainly cant make mental errors and be in the wrong place
7702824 the basic one issue going into this game that i still think that because has had so much experience at tackle that if we lost a tackle in the game we would move him out to tackle rather than playing one of the young guys right now were really impressed with the development of the young players but to throw them in the frying pan right now we might be better served brian motley has made really good progress especially since weve kind of been playing him at guard rather than center so thats been helpful to him david ross has also done a good job at right guard so even though we hate moving the guys around in the offensive line i think if something happened to a tackle would give us the best option at back up tackle right now at this point in the season
7702825 the move has worked out really really well as well in terms of being his back up but we also could move back to that position if we needed to but thats not something that we would plan on doing right now
7702826 hes done very well for us i cant predict the future in terms of what he might do or what he might be but hes certainly been a very consistent player hes got great quickness hes got good understanding hes a great competitor he works hard every day hes probably one of the hardest working guys we have on the team hes got good instincts hes playing multiple positions corner and star which takes a lot more focus on his part because they are completely different position but hes done an outstanding job for us and hopefully hell have a great year for us playing both as a returner and as a starter in the secondary
7702827 i dont have any experience dealing with it ive known him ever since hes been back at toledo but past my time at toledo i think one thing he does a really good job of is they have a tremendous amount of multiples in their offense they use a lot of different personnel groups a lot of different formations utilizes the players that he has and when he has good skill players that makes him even more effective but this team probably when you take the cumulative effect of all that they do and they do a good job of executing so im saying this in a positive way that the way they present themselves each week is always a challenge to the defense from an adjustment standpoint in terms of how they use their players and the formations they use the multiples of this team are probably as great as anybody that we play
7702828 well they use three wide receivers and four wide receivers a lot so that usually puts you in that circumstance and situation
7702829 we feel like we have four running backs that have really made good progress throughout the course of camp has had a really good camp and done a really good job all the way around as a player also as a special teams players hes probably one of our core guys that is outstanding and we have total faith trust and confidence in him to play even though hes listed a little below the rest has probably been the surprise of all the young players in terms of his maturity as a player hes elusive he has speed but he has power and tremendous toughness and hes a good receiver so hes a very very good all around guy youve seen a lot of glen coffee is mr consistency for us in terms of being able to do just about everything whether its being a good receiver being a good blocker and being decent with the ball in his hands so we dont have a third down back in that bunch we feel like several of those guys can play that role and we certainly need to figure out ways to use these guys throughout the course of the season because we feel good about that group of guys this year
7702830 i ask each and every one of you to work has hard for barack and joe biden as you did for me

7702837 ser governo n o significa ser estado e por ser apenas uma parte dele sofremos uma s rie de amarras
7702838 general petraeus said in a letter to his troops my sense is we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our enemies in a number of areas of iraq we are in short a long way from the goal line but we do have the ball we are driving down the field is that what you expect him to say tomorrow
7702839 brit has assured jamie lynn that shell build a nursery for maddie even promising that when she buys her new place it will have a special wing for them
7702840 a denver tv station is reporting authorities may have foiled an assassination plot against barack obama and theres talk the suspects may be members of a white supremacy group kusa tv claims three men are in custody after a routine traffic stop in aurora near denver turned up two rifles high powered scopes ammo and meth the man in the car led authorities to a hotel where another suspect jumped out of a fourth floor window in an attempt to escape
7702841 mom and my grandmother have given me good motherly advice ut its one of those things where your mother instincts kind of kick in right away
7702842 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
7702843 he has absolutely no doubt that this will be the case
7702844 any student that is part of an extracurricular activity would have to agree they could be randomly selected for drug screening
7702845 if i felt my kid were doing it id test myself
7702846 please geocode this address and return the city sign in before you can post messages
7702847 everything meshed together from the consultation process through to the design and construction there were very very few design issues you could read the plans and know exactly what was happening
7702848 leadership excellence and best practice in the provision of land transport infrastructure
7702849 i want to go home the russian troops are here
7702850 its a good way to touch someones life it doesnt take a lot of effort
7702851 the only bridge into the motorcamp was getting up and was getting logs and debris blocking it and it was not certain if it was going to overflow
7702852 que muy cordialmente con caf bebidas y mucho m s nos abri mart n gershanik y equipo
7702853 really the choice of joe biden in my opinion is tantamount to an admission barack obama himself lacks the necessary experience to be president
7702854 a couple of his team mates in a fit of high spirits took a photo of him sitting on a toilet and in what they saw as a prank circulated this photo to other team members
7702855 this was inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign for which the team members concerned have been suspended from the team
7702856 all three swimmers are very remorseful and have apologised to team management for what was poor judgement on their part and accept the punishment handed down
7702857 hey nice screwgun do you know where i can get one for my 6 year old daughter
7702858 no existe otra variable de tanta importancia ecol gica para los ecosistemas marinos costeros que haya cambiado tan dr sticamente y en tan poco tiempo como el ox geno disuelto
7702859 es uno de los mayores problemas ambientales en la actualidad
7702860 ocurren en las reas m s productivas para el pescado el cangrejo o el mejill n ya se han reducido las capturas de varias especies en el mar negro el b ltico casi todas las bah as de jap n o en kattegat
7702861 en algunas r as gallegas como en la de pontevedra que es recurrente por la cercana industria de la celulosa o en la de la coru a
7702862 al calentarse el agua aumenta el consumo de ox geno de los organismos marinos baja la solubilidad del ox geno en el mar y baja el intercambio con la atm sfera
7702863 keep your head up if you escape hell we gettin fucked up when we was eight we went to bat day to see the yanks in sixty nine his father and mines they robbed banks he pointed to the charm on his neck with his last bit of energy left told me rock it with respect i opened it seen the god holdin his kids photogenic tears just burst out my wig
7702864 alone we can do so little together we can do so much
7702865 a commitment to the timeless ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice
7702866 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7702867 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now
7702868 and i know someone else whos been inspired all over again by senator obama
7702869 a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died
7702870 we can no longer ignore the effect television has over our childrens food choices
7702871 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which has said it may not work
7702872 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7702873 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both
7702874 the kids who are engaging in community sport a lot of them want to have the hope in their eyes that they can rise to elite representational levels as well
7702875 the government is funding a large slab of investment in community level sport school sports indigenous sports but also were not going to be back tracking when it comes to funding for olympic level sports either
7702876 republican they think the democrats will take their guns away from them
7702877 sen obama made the right decision and i think for the right reasons
7702878 this is really kind of putting a laser on a lot of different issues and policy concerns across the country saying this is exactly where the democratic party will take you
7702879 the urgency people feel in america is palpable and real and they want change they want to know how were going to change it and they want to know it now
7702880 i dont think anyone including president bush believes no child left behind is really working
7702881 people are getting frustrated on the education issue because it doesnt seem like anything is getting done
7702882 its not the last place a person might own but a great place to build equity and move up
7702883 youre in a small space with great amenities and the resources of the city
7702884 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7702885 i was breathing a sigh for my father that night that he had come up short
7702886 yet i felt such great pride that there was such overwhelming support for him at that time
7702887 the rough and tumble of the primaries that all goes with the territory
7702888 my dad would always say when i was growing up from those to whom much is given much is expected
7702889 there was the other illness in the family that we never did talk about
7702890 i think were on the verge of enacting groundbreaking legislation
7702891 this is essential for us to begin to really start looking at toxics in products
7702892 right now everything we look at and have been looking at are emissions wastes and discharges
7702893 people are not only surprised to find that the state currently doesnt have authority over products that contain dangerous chemicals they expect that the state should
7702894 right now most californians assume that state government has the authority to take toxic products off the shelves thats actually not true except in a very few specific cases where the legislature has acted
7702895 but were encouraged by it this kind of format is much more preferred than what were dealing with in the legislature
7702896 what are either of them going to do to help people of america to help them keep their jobs
7702897 it was not quite the bodys rejection of the defibrillator
7702898 but its a means for a body to cleanse itself of something foreign to it
7702899 i was the national chair for hillary clinton as someone who worked hard for her no matter who you voted for we have a responsibility to the party to come together and unite
7702900 im disappointed i was hoping she was going to be the running mate
7702901 it was tough only because it was so emotional for me
7702902 when the people of my district meet him personally they will support him
7702903 im disappointed she was not chosen as the vice president i think he needed her
7702904 i would like to see the obama campaign and his administration take a more proactive role in acknowledging what women like me experience frequently in the business and political world and thats the lack of equality and blatant sexism thats what hillary encountered
7702905 there are some in the media that want to characterize it as a lack of unity we will have an opportunity to have our say we want to have our say then come together
7702906 el giro social del gobierno dice que nadie ning n poder f ctico imperialista o medi tico puede impedir que honduras se una al alba s a honduras
7702907 somos suficientemente soberanos herencia de nuestros m rtires y por eso podemos decir al mundo que honduras no tiene que pedir permiso a ning n imperialista para suscribir el alba
7702908 el alba no nos obliga a nada sino que abre una puerta de esperanza para enfrentar las crisis internacional que nos ha golpeado energ ticamente y alimentariamente en los sectores pobres que son las grandes mayor as
7702909 pues en ese tiempo todos tienen que saber leer la palabra socialismo y capitalismo para entender la diferencia
7702910 yo no nac para ser esclavo o para tener amos que nos han tenido sometidos alienados y desinformados el alba nos sirvi de espacio para abrir los ojos a la libertad
7702911 fieras heridas serpientes venenosas y pitiyanquis que entregaron estos pa ses
7702912 and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him
7702913 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
7702914 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
7702915 if the incident had been reversed and it had been an atheist that had physically assaulted a theist for postering for a theist event that would easily be considered a hate crime and it frequently is this is the exact reverse scenario
7702916 they are treating it not as a hate crime but as a dispute that arose and led to an altercation
7702917 we dont have anything that suggests that as far as im aware of i know mr trottier was talking about that but certainly from what i see it doesnt look like it falls within what our policies and procedures define as a hate crime
7702918 but were still looking at that as well to cover all the bases
7702919 the first individual smacked me in the face twice and said
7702920 atheists have never been accorded the same respect as those with religious beliefs even though our position originates in logic and reason not myth and superstition this escalation of a systemic although till now hidden discrimination is very troubling
7702921 i think i discovered the hard way the boundaries of freedom of speech
7702922 the fact that an atheist should fear for his well being while advertising for a university event that seeks to promote free inquiry is alarming and though i feared for my life briefly ive never felt as strong about my atheism my colleagues and i have only strengthened our resolve to forge ahead with our agenda to push for secularism science and freedom of thought
7702923 you can turn me over i am done on this side
7702924 love your enemies do good to those who hate and persecute you
7702925 if a man slaps you on one cheek offer the other as well
7702926 if a man should take your shoes offer him your coat as well
7702927 love your enemies do good to those who hate and persecute you
7702928 if a man slaps you on one cheek offer the other as well
7702929 if a man should take your shoes offer him your coat as well
7702930 let he among you who is without sin cast the first stone
7702931 if atrocities against people of kashmir are not stopped the situation in india will change adversely for which the indian government will solely be responsible
7702932 they tore my curfew pass and later punched kicked and hit me with batons
7702933 maybe we are a little bit crazy maybe we are just bored
7702934 portuguese players like all the glamour perfume look all nice and here people just get down and get dirty
7702935 this is bizarre but when you think about it it makes training so much more fun
7702936 the sport is also a symbolical mental liberation from the restraining yoke of being constantly within reach
7702937 its our nature to create fun happenings probably because our summers are so short
7702938 at first it was difficult to promote them as they were small local events where people did not speak any foreign language
7702939 but now they are raising the interest of foreign press and visitors probably because they are so different from anything else going in their own countries
7702940 it became apparent that those individuals and clients were engaging in prostitution offenses
7702941 bas pakt koffer in voor patries afgelopen zou zijn bas had waarschijnlijk klaargestaan met alleen een kleine rugzak lekker praktisch en waarom zou je drie paar laarzen willen meenemen als je toch maar n paar tegelijkertijd aan kan
7702942 with which candidate will you have a more healthy long term relationship with which candidate can you be confident about an equal exchange of the five characteristics found in healthy relationships and with which candidate can you permanently affix their bumper sticker to your car without fear of having to remove it under the cover of darkness if they fail to meet or exceed your expectations
7702943 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7702944 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7702945 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7702946 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7702947 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7702948 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7702949 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7702950 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7702951 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7702952 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7702953 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7702954 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7702955 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7702956 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7702957 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7702958 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7702959 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7702960 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7702961 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7702962 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7702963 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7702964 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7702965 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7702966 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7702967 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7702968 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7702969 why do today what you can put off til tomorrow
7702970 im so sorry but i dont have the courage or know how to back this little demio up on this alley that is so narrow my mirrors are almost brushing the concrete walls on either side of me and then id have to back some more into a driveway to let you by so if you could please back up that would be so kind and i promise to pay it forward at some other time when i feel more confident
7702971 about 40 years have passed since the battle of okinawa and yet the indescribable tragedy we experienced and witnessed on the battlefield still haunts our memory we will never forget the horror of the pre world war ii militaristic education which drove us to the battlefield with no skepticism but rather with a willingness to serve we strongly feel that we must continue to tell our stories of a war filled with insanity and brutality now that the post war generations who have no idea what war is have formed the majority of our population and that the peace threatening signs in both domestic and international politics cannot be ignored believing an appeal for world peace will be the way to repose the souls of those who perished we the himeyuri alumnae founded the himeyuri peace museum on this site we are most grateful for the sincere encouragement and support that we received from many individuals and organizations in and outside the prefecture in the process of its foundation
7702972 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7702973 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7702974 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7702975 the most important factors for innovation and success shows that the essential elements required to achieve this are an active knowledge of the business a distinctive network between companies universities and research facilities as well as the ability to obtain resources at short notice
7702976 if the united nations and facebook combined international diplomacy would become a popularity contest with every country competing to have the most friends
7702977 massachusetts has lost more industries than any region in the world but has also created more industries than any other region
7702978 boston started the auto industry and lost it to detroit
7702979 after 30 years headquartered here at amp t moved to new york
7702980 the quest to turn efficiency minded managers into growth generating creatives has yielded everything from innovation gyms to innovation officers in 2008 general electric
7702981 recruitment has always been about relationships an effective recruiter will have a strong network of trusted candidates and will enjoy long term relationships with his or her regular clients in recent years we have seen some fascinating technology led innovation in the recruitment industry from the introduction of internet based job boards where hundreds of thousands of jobs can be listed in one place to the technological revolution in the processing of candidate information within the social network itself there is a significant commercial opportunity however as an industry that depends on personal relationships and networks recruiters potentially have a lot to gain from tapping into these online groups linkedin is an early innovator in this field where they have built a network of 7m senior businesspeople who can connect with suppliers recruiters and each other in only a few years online social networks have grown into communities with millions of members as the technology behind them advances we can expect their importance to grow across a range of industries

7702983 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7702984 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7702985 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7702986 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7702987 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7702988 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7702989 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7702990 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7702991 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7702992 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7702993 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7702994 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7702995 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7702996 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7702997 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7702998 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7702999 the democrats are now preparing for their convention in denver and they have hired the first ever director of greening they say that this year that everything about their convention will be green including nominating a candidate whos only been a senator for a couple of years
7703000 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
7703001 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7703002 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7703003 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7703004 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7703005 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7703006 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7703007 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7703008 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7703009 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7703010 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7703011 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7703012 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7703013 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7703014 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7703015 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7703016 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7703017 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7703018 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7703019 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7703020 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7703021 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7703022 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7703023 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7703024 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7703025 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7703026 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7703027 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7703028 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7703029 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7703030 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7703031 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7703032 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7703033 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7703034 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7703035 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7703036 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7703037 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7703038 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7703039 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7703040 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7703041 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7703042 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7703043 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7703044 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7703045 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7703046 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7703047 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7703048 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7703049 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7703050 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7703051 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7703052 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7703053 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7703054 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7703055 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7703056 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7703057 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7703058 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7703059 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7703060 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7703061 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7703062 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7703063 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7703064 did i tell my reader something or did i show them something
7703065 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7703066 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7703067 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7703068 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7703069 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7703070 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7703071 whats the extent of change that you need to make in the next 2 years
7703072 lucifer makes his appearance in the fourteenth chapter of the old testament book of isaiah at the twelfth verse and nowhere else
7703073 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star
7703074 this passage is often related to satan and a similar thought is expressed in luke 10 18 by jesus that was not its first meaning
7703075 it seems minor but the actual term used in the greek septuagint version of isaiah 14 12 given that there is no one way of accurately transliterating is eo u s phoros morning star dawn god of light
7703076 the origin of the judeo christian devil as an angel fallen from heaven into the depths of hell is mirrored in the descent of venus from shining morning star to the darkness below this underworld demon still feared today by people in many parts of the world is also called lucifer which was originally a latin name for venus as a morning star
7703077 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7703078 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7703079 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7703080 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7703081 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7703082 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7703083 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7703084 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7703085 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7703086 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7703087 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7703088 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7703089 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7703090 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7703091 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7703092 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7703093 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7703094 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7703095 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7703096 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7703097 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7703098 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7703099 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7703100 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7703101 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7703102 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7703103 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7703104 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7703105 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7703106 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7703107 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7703108 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7703109 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7703110 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7703111 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7703112 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7703113 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7703114 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7703115 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7703116 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7703117 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7703118 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7703119 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7703120 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7703121 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7703122 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7703123 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7703124 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7703125 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7703126 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7703127 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7703128 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7703129 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7703130 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7703131 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7703132 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7703133 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7703134 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7703135 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7703136 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7703137 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7703138 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7703139 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7703140 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7703141 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7703142 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7703143 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7703144 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7703145 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7703146 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7703147 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7703148 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7703149 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7703150 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7703151 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7703152 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7703153 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7703154 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7703155 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7703156 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7703157 i prefer to think that god is not dead just drunk
7703158 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7703159 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7703160 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7703161 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7703162 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7703163 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7703164 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7703165 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7703166 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7703167 sold has been a very elusive carrot on a very long stick for overprices unstaged under marketed homes for 18 months
7703168 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7703169 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7703170 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7703171 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7703172 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7703173 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7703174 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7703175 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7703176 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7703177 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7703178 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7703179 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7703180 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7703181 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7703182 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7703183 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7703184 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7703185 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7703186 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7703187 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7703188 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7703189 dit og was voor ons een ware plaag ze speelden erg goed
7703190 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7703191 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7703192 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7703193 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7703194 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7703195 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7703196 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7703197 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7703198 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7703199 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7703200 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7703201 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7703202 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7703203 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7703204 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7703205 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7703206 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7703207 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7703208 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7703209 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7703210 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7703211 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7703212 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7703213 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7703214 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7703215 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7703216 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7703217 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

7703229 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans

7703254 boart longyears 2008 first half results reflect continued strong growth from both our drilling services and products divisions due to ongoing high demand particularly in mineral exploration the companys chief executive designate president and chief operating officer craig kipp said

7703278 spouses and children of and or people who have intimate relations with corrupt officials could be jailed for more than seven years if they are found guilty of taking advantage of such officials positions to get bribes or make money illegally
7703279 taking bribes has become a practice among some relatives and or lovers of corrupt officials
7703280 many of the corrupt officials tend to have extra marital affairs
7703281 retired officials too could face similar punishment if they use their influence in the government to make money illegally
7703282 proposes tougher penalties for officials with big assets from unidentified sources officials who cannot give the source of their assets could be jailed for up to 10 years instead of the current five years

7703286 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations acting chief executive ian johnston said today
7703287 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth mr johnston said
7703288 we have not been immune from industry wide pressures including an economic slow down in key markets and higher grape prices
7703289 we are making good progress with our wine review but wont be commenting on our analysis or conclusions until the review is completed
7703290 vb remains australias favourite beer with the healthy growth of vb gold returning the brand to overall growth
7703291 we expect the beer market to remain resilient with brand innovation driving value growth
7703292 some very deliberate pricing decisions have slowed beer volume growth but strong value growth continues mr johnston said
7703293 those three factors are really what impacted our result chief executive john mulcahy said
7703294 but we would expect the volatility of the markets to stabilise mr mulcahy said
7703295 we wouldnt expect credit spreads for instance to widen significantly from here
7703296 we would think over time they would contract to some extent
7703297 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately mr mulcahy said
7703298 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities mr skilton said of the exposures
7703299 its not to say were not watching them very closely
7703300 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment mr mulcahy said
7703301 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly

7703322 debemos estar ordenados trabajar mucho el partido dejar mucho sacrificio como lo hicimos el s bado queremos ganar como quer amos hacerlo el s bado pero los partidos presentan circunstancias ante toluca tuvimos que venir de atr s y remar contracorriente confiamos en que vamos a sacar esto adelante

7703366 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7703367 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment

7703377 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7703378 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black

7703380 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

7703386 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7703387 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7703388 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7703389 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7703390 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7703391 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up

7703394 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7703395 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7703396 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7703397 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7703398 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise abkhazia and south ossetia
7703399 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region

7703404 the timing and number of rrv cases in the darwin area can be very accurately predicted up to one month in advance based on rainfall minimum temperatures and mosquito numbers from our mosquito monitoring program
7703405 this is an excellent tool to more effectively control overall numbers of salt marsh and other mosquitoes as we can perform timely and more efficient spraying of mosquito breeding sites
7703406 it will give us the opportunity to educate people about where virus hotspots are at certain times of the year which will ultimately reduce the number of people who contract rrv

7703415 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7703416 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7703417 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7703418 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7703419 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7703420 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7703421 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7703422 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7703423 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7703424 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

7703440 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7703441 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7703442 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position
7703443 there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
7703444 optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals
7703445 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7703446 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7703447 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7703448 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7703449 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7703450 frankly the rapidly increasing scarcity of great 19th century rugs
7703451 combined with our clienteles escalating knowledge and the ability to view and purchase one in the world investment level rugs on our website have created a unique confluence of factors during my nearly 30 years in the business
7703452 collectible to museum level rugs that are both rare works of art and still in the superb condition that they can be used on the owners residences
7703453 potential clients who have been drawn to great antique rugs over the last three decades often come to him with a seasoned eye and a great hunger in drought like conditions in the international market
7703454 many clients continue to purchase spectacular pieces more than they could possibly display in their homes and either ask us to store them or are putting them into private museums we often revolve clients rugs over periods of time at one or more of their residences
7703455 our clients soon discover that the quality of carpets we consistently offer is virtually never found elsewhere and when they occasionally do appear at auction they often sell for prices that exceed the established market value
7703456 the 100 to 200 year old rugs in our collection can never be duplicated such as handmade area rugs silk rugs persian rugs oriental rugs wool rugs etc they were created at time when the artistic sensitivity of the weavers and their craftsmanship were unmatched
7703457 in that sense rug collectors view their pieces in the manner that a collector of paintings views a monet or van gogh
7703458 additionally the market for rugs of this quality does not fluctuate depending on external economic conditions
7703459 the intrinsic value of this kind of art and its one of a kind quality separates it from other kinds of investments
7703460 there appears to have been a significant amount of investment money on the sidelines
7703461 the collection with its extensive inventory of top 19th century carpets has allowed our clients to diversify as well as enjoy their investments
7703462 determination is breaking down seemingly impossible tasks by concentrating on achievable goals
7703463 we have a 1982 easement with peco energy from township line road in cromby up to fricks lock
7703464 from fricks lock north is where we are negotiating with landowners

7703467 this investigation deals a major blow to a drug trafficking organization which operated primarily out of the city of chester

7703475 can win any conventional battle against ill armed extremists but both history and the latest doctrine on counterinsurgency suggest that ultimate victory will require control of afghanistans borders hundreds of thousands of troops and a much stronger and more legitimate afghan state which could take afghans decades to build the west does not have the resources to match our ambitions in counterinsurgency and we never will
7703476 stop all this happy talk here about how the use of force doesnt make sense
7703477 the use of force in afghanistan is justified and necessary in darfur justified and necessary in the balkans justified and necessary you guys can have your happy talk theres real life
7703478 just because afghanistan has problems that need to be solved does not mean that the west can solve them all my experience suggests that those pushing for an expansion of our military presence there are wrong we dont need bold new plans and billions more in aid instead we need less investment but a greater focus on what we know how to do
7703479 bidens toughness on darfur has something to do with the fact that sudan is weak enough for washington to force it to cooperate

7703706 and its going to get worse if our visa officials dont change their attitude and show some compassion
7703707 facilitate the entry of bonafide visitors to canada for such purposes as trade commerce tourism international understanding and cultural educational and scientific activities while also protecting the health safety and security of canadian society
7703708 visa officers have the discretionary power to decide who to let in theres no humanitarian and compassionate consideration their decisions are completely arbitrary and dont get reviewed
7703709 the onus shouldve been on the canadian officials to show that these people would not leave canada after their visits
7703710 whenever we go back home we stay with our families and relatives we would like to play hosts to someone when they come here
7703711 theres an underlying prejudicial overtone against those from developing countries its not really just a class issue because you can be a millionaire in china but still get rejected
7703712 the visa is to protect our border from the undesirables thats why we welcome some more than others
7703713 immigration reacts slowly to the global economic and political changes countries like china and india are becoming bigger economic powers
7703714 my concern is our visa officers are still using outdated standards to judge these applications believing these people will come and stay in canada
7703715 you know what would be a great early birthday present
7703716 even the most violent games and tv shows can help children conquer fears and develop a bold sense of self

7703720 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7703721 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7703722 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream

7703734 the good old days of liberal stripper gate will be a thing of the past
7703735 what were trying to do here is protect vulnerable foreign workers ones that could easily be exposed to sexual exploitation harassment and abuse
7703736 keeping foreign exotic dancers out of canada will not address the issue of exploitation if the conservative government is truly concerned about exploitation of exotic dancers then they should focus on ensuring health and safety standards exist at strip clubs
7703737 rather unemotional does not like attention more interested in intellectual pursuits

7703739 they do not believe in or follow rules and regulations as this would prohibit their ability to do their own thing
7703740 get a good routine going where you go to bed around the same time at night and get up around the same time if you have poor sleeping habits it interferes with your sleep patterns and this can cause bad dreams
7703741 if you want to avoid dreaming sleep in a really uncomfortable or painful position
7703742 dreams are sometimes a way of dealing with issues you may be avoiding when you are awake if you confront and deal with your waking life problems the bad dreams will go otherwise get drunk i rarely remember my dreams when i get drunk
7703743 if you dont dream than you will have a mental breakdown in a few weeks
7703744 the only way to rid yourself of dreams is to drink till you pass out each night
7703745 prayer about my dreams before bed works for me i specifically pray for a peaceful nights rest without frightening scary sad etc dreams prayer works for all things
7703746 by no means watch tv after dinner that excites the brain

7703749 the guards suspected the animal might be involved in drug smuggling once they noticed four prisoners visibly intoxicated shortly after the pigeon landed on a prison window

7703752 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect
7703753 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7703754 in the end we are certain that the governor will see firsthand that our plant is anything but a jungle and that when all the bitterness of the last few months is taken out of the equation that we are indeed on a course to being on an even higher road
7703755 hey time to fork over hundreds of dollars that my office can quickly spend on pork projects thanks for living here
7703756 our previous backlog took a while to kind of build really and it was driven primarily by large significant increases in new claims
7703757 whereas this time whats quite different is really the number of refugee claimants hasnt gone up very significantly its being driven this time sort of internally essentially through the lack of members to hear claims
7703758 hijacking irb for their own political benefit whether to appoint their friends or whether to impose their ideology
7703759 i dont know if gods will for you includes a husband i do know his plan for your life is perfect and youll be much happier living in the center of his will than following your own dreams

7703762 this is not a container load of washing machines that weve decided to reject these are human beings
7703763 theyre our responsibility and this policy is shredding the united nations refugee convention

7703765 such mythic additions to reality carry a resonance beyond that possible for mere fantasy creations the more exposure we have to a fantasy tradition the more easily it can work upon us mythic worlds not rooted in known traditions have trouble communicating their reality to the reader

7703767 what law school did you attend and where did you place in that class and the other question is
7703768 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7703769 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7703770 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7703771 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk
7703772 its not only a crime to the retirees but to the taxpayers of stamford
7703773 i hope that the contract language and the performance of the pension will deliver an increase to them
7703774 you have to do something around here stamford is growing and there is no infrastructure to support it 95 and the merritt are already overtaxed and clearly cannot have capacity added to them any little thing that can get even a few cars of the road will help light rail could help and expanding metro north and shoreline east needs to be part of the equation
7703775 stamford is a small to medium sized town city and can not handle a trolley now that the city removed all rails a few years ago trolley and freight train alike three years ago the mayor could not wait to remove the rails and now he wants them back again stamford has lost its population with the outsourcing of jobs and closing down of companies that made stamford great
7703776 that 175m upgrading of the waster treatment plant is an example it still smells on magee avenue afterwards and we were told the smells would no longer be there after the upgrading in the case of stamford and all the major upgrades wanted to bring in money only we are a small town and to do what is being voted on blindly would require eliminating the total areas around and in the downtown to re design stamford from the ground up
7703777 if we got the trolley who would clean the tracks and roads we have no public works as it used to be road clearing maintaining sidewalks repairing the roads and curbing all that has been privatized to certain companies that do shoddie jobs to say the least potholes return in three months curbs disintergrat etc no to the trolley as the to put it in would constrick the regular vehicle traffic as the roads can not be widened and made safe for the users safety comes of money
7703778 when i was growing up stamford was a great place to live the trolly was gone but the tracks were still in place on west main street anyway things were in a slower mode people walked alot and stopped to talk to one another you hardly see that any more in my opinion stamford was better then than it is now
7703779 i grew up near woodside park now scalzi and know what happened in 1995 through the with this river
7703780 the river itself has not been dredged since atleast the early 70s and has been left to rot and turn into a junkyard in general
7703781 if the zoning board goes along with this project then we know why the trump parc was allowed to be built where it is it is all about image but whos the cities or the city governments
7703782 the town growth is long out of control which is one of the many reasons i have recently moved out of state
7703783 how quickly trump got his building up while other areas seemed more suitable south end etc
7703784 notice driving down west broad st from the hospital or down high ridge rd from lord amp taylorss what does one see its a travesty
7703785 but unfortunately the voices of the minority real stamfordites go unheard
7703786 four greenwich teenagers were arrested last night after officers found flat screen televisions in two different cars both allegedly robbed from sportsplex a fitness club on brownhouse road city police said
7703787 almost all of bedford is owned by this dude named mario who lets it sit empty with high rents
7703788 the reason no one has built on the hole is that the owners want upwards of 20 million for it
7703789 regarding the idea that the lodatos should lease out their bedford st storefronts on a short term basis what sane person is going to put a penny into a business with only a short term non renewable lease
7703790 this summer i wanted to really commit to the whole eco blogging scene and wanted to set up an account that i was going to use to post news and reviews about the environemnt a space in which i could write about my monthly environemntal challenges while providing resources for my readers
7703791 many of the suggestions are now so well aired that most of us are probably growing a little weary of hearing them putting on a jumper instead of turning up the heating ranked a lowly 49 out of 50 on the list cycling more 31 and growing your own vegetables 23
7703792 my hope is that we come to see consumption as slightly naff something you do only when you have to
7703793 a priority in their resettlement policy because this is an area of tremendous need and vulnerability
7703794 we need to fast track the process to bring some iraqis here to canada
7703795 the victims of this whole war are iraqi civilians and those civilians have no refuge to escape this violence but to escape iraq
7703796 life for them in syria and jordan is unbearable it is very hard for them getting residency permits and is a strain financially
7703797 i dont think anyone has a good grasp of the breadth of the problem we are facing here
7703798 they are arriving here with the most basic of needs food and shelter
7703799 more and more are living without proper health care or proper sanitation
7703800 necessitating a reassessment of unhcrs work and its priorities throughout the region providing more help to the thousands who are fleeing every month
7703801 it can be tempting to look at the challenges in iraq and conclude our best option is to pack up and go home
7703802 that may be satisfying in the short run but i believe the consequences for american security would be devastating
7703803 it is a withdraw the troops bill not a fund the troops bill
7703804 it would also force failure of the mission in iraq and forfeit the sacrifices made by our troops
7703805 the white house said theres weapons of mass destruction the white house says we can do this with less troops the white house says mission accomplished
7703806 we are clearly concerned as to whether in addition to prioritizing secure borders the government is ensuring fair and humane treatment of legitimate asylum seekers
7703807 we are really quite disappointed and dismayed by the lack of a response
7703808 but some of their recommendations just werent practical given the enormous flood of illegal immigrants that we deal with every day
7703809 an intention to apply for asylum a fear of torture or a fear of return to his or her country
7703810 asylum seekers continue to be jailed in these prisonlike facilities for months and in some cases for years
7703811 one of the big issues that weve highlighted is the issue of the one year deadline
7703812 in the us you must make a claim within one year of arriving people claiming based on sexual orientation might not know that they are eligible for protection and if they are coming from a homophobic society it might take longer than a year to grow into an understanding of who they are
7703813 the law makes it stricter in terms of providing corroborating evidence of persecution when people are fleeing because of their sexual orientation its often not spelt out homophobia happens in the shadows in many parts of the world both the experience of being gay and the way people are persecuted is not always explicit
7703814 theres a difference in the number of brains that can hit the target and theres also discrimination against the brains that happen to belong to females
7703815 you take that word out of this story and you invalidate my history as an african american male
7703816 do i like the word no but to pretend nobody said it is wrong i wouldnt even consider doing that
7703817 context is everything and its not gratuitous its not for shock value
7703818 what is your view on abortion should it be available on demand available with restrictions or prohibited completely
7703819 so not only did these children come from you but youre also providing food and nutrients for them too so you not only build life but you also nurture and maintain it all in a days work thats wild oh and you sew and dress them too just an all around kinda gal

7703831 he agreed he was more than lucky and that he missed me
7703832 i decided to just leave it at that i didnt want to keep going back and forth forever on text just a few to see hes thinking about me is enough
7703833 my friends believe he is into me but his mind is else where
7703834 get to the scrubbing boy i didnt put effort to make you to sit around all day
7703835 i think its because im walking around so upset about what has been happening to me wanting them to go away waiting patiently for my medicine to work that its almost as if im thinking about anxiety all day rather than trying to forget it and enjoy my life
7703836 the rocks from the chicago suburb of downers grove have fielded calls from

7703843 why do they keep trying to make stamford into a mini new york
7703844 more and more stamford natives are leaving their hometown because of the urban spread which continues even after people attend meetings and are opposed to it
7703845 there are ways to keep our city from getting more and more traffic due to the high rise building sprouting up all over stamford
7703846 the only one benefitting from this mess is the real estate crews and contractors that the city always hires to mess things up

7703862 protestors trickled in down the path from tower bridge dispersing among the crowds of camera toting tourists and their toddlers high school volleyball teams on school trips students and local workers
7703863 however despite the thousands of leaflets printed advertising the action and despite the months of planning postering and stickering barely one hundred protestors gathered at city hall for the demonstration
7703864 at least two hours before the scheduled 6pm protests police officers had already established a concentrated perimeter around city hall stretching beyond the borders offered by the picturesque london and tower bridges
7703865 police medics and hundreds of police officers swarmed around city hall patrolling the area in pairs equipped with earpieces and accompanied by the fit team outfitted in blue vests as demonstrators arrived in small groups fit team officers slowed into motion tailing individuals photographing groups of would be protestors stopping and searching anyone wearing a black hooded sweatshirt
7703866 if you think this is disturbing you should know its being done to over 20 million people around the world
7703867 we realize that if advertising can sell products why not use its power to help people understand that millions of ordinary people are caught in a nightmare of persecution violence and personal tragedy
7703868 these people desperately need our help and the campaign will help to create much needed awareness about refugees
7703869 weve all seen the news reports and images of refugees around the world but the challenge in telling their stories is that their experiences are so far removed from our daily lives now imagine coming home after a long day at work to find that all your personal possessions and the home you know have been taken from you this is an experience we can all relate to and we used this as our starting point for the campaign so people could begin to understand what refugees around the world go through on a daily basis

7703872 the packages of documentary evidence in the two cases were the same the time frame the same and the issue to be determined was the same
7703873 in one case a member held an organization not to be engaged in terrorism while in the instant case on the very same evidence the member found that the organization had engaged in terrorism
7703874 the failure to explain the basis for the different conclusion undermines the integrity of immigration and refugee board decisions and gives them an aura of arbitrariness which is no doubt not intended nor is it acceptable
7703875 the notion of terrorism is fairly straightforward it is ideologically or politically motivated violence directed against civilian targets im surprised that there are disagreements among judges
7703876 there is the famous statement one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter but that is grossly leading it assesses the validity of the cause when terrorism is an act one can have a perfectly beautiful cause and yet if one commits terrorist acts it is terrorism regardless
7703877 because they were doing good work and they were helping the poor people especially for education and the people who were sick they were opening hospitals
7703878 i have reasonable grounds to believe that the mqm under the firm control of altaf hussain is not only a legitimate political party but also an armed opposition group that commits acts of violence
7703879 in my view there is sufficient specificity in the kidnappings murders and rapes and other acts of torture that took place as a result of torture chambers run by the mqm
7703880 intentionally cause death or serious bodily injury to party dissidents or political opponents in order to intimidate them thus the facts that i have reasonable grounds to believe fit the definition of terrorism
7703881 i find however that the ministers evidence is insufficient to show that the mqm a has committed terrorist acts i consider the documentary evidence is either not credible or too vague to find there are reasonable grounds to believe the mqm a has committed terrorist acts
7703882 what undermines the irbs decision in the siddiqui case is the failure to address the contradictory finding in the memon decision
7703883 the first condition if the kuffar enter a muslim land in this condition the pious predecessors those who succeeded them the ulama of the four mathhabs maliki hanafi shaffii and hanbali the muhadditheen and the tafseer commentators are agreed that in all islamic ages jihad under this condition becomes fard ayn upon the muslims of the land which the kuffar have attacked and upon the muslims close by where the children will march forth without the permission of the parents the wife without the permission of her husband and the debtor without the permission of the creditor

7703890 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7703891 she must know very well one of the premier works on the subject jesuit john connerys
7703892 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7703893 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

7703935 i do remember the desire for independence that nancy seemed to have and of course she had a completely different lifestyle than i did she hooked me on mysteries
7703936 but nancy with her daring intelligence and courage gave us another possibility to do something outside the expected role

7703939 how the makers of quicken beat microsoft and revolutionized an entire industry in ide intuit is a tale of missionaries not mercenaries
7703940 revolutionize how people manage their financial lives many companies say their most important job is satisfying the customer we dont we believe that satisfying the customer is simply the minimum requirement for staying in business therefore we dont seek merely to satisfy our customers we seek to wow them integrity without compromise never approaching what could be considered questionable behavior do right by all our customers treat each other our business partners and our shareholders with the same care and respect with which we treat our customers customers define quality intuit has triumphed in part because we actively solicit input and invent new ways to solicit that input from our customers
7703941 afterward what about results things like market share growing our revenue profits we barely mention them in our values dont we care about results we do market share is a measure of how well we are serving customers long term earnings growth creates shareholder value which also helps us attract and retain the best people do we have to sacrifice our operating values to meet financial goals by no means attention to the financial implications of our actions is simply an aspect of making these tradeoffs well simply put living and working by our operating values will create customer wow and shareholder value

7704146 but the idea that we are vital sexual creatures is still looked at in some cases with disgust or in other cases a bit of embarrassment so to really take a look at how our sexuality adds to our life and enhances our life and our health both physical and psychological is eye opening for many people
7704147 one of the reasons people say they have sex is to feel good about themselves
7704148 great sex begins with self esteem and it raises it if the sex is loving connected and what you want it raises it
7704149 oxytocin allows us to feel the urge to nurture and to bond
7704150 if we believe absurdities we shall commit atrocities let us therefore reject all superstition in order to become more human
7704151 civility is dead to begin with there is no doubt whatever about that the register of its burial was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner civility is as dead as a door nail
7704152 if i am quiet through this concert not only will i be kinder to others but i will enjoy it more myself
7704153 if we believe absurdities we shall commit atrocities let us therefore reject all superstition in order to become more human
7704154 you know education if you make the most of it you study hard you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart you can do well and if you dont you get stuck in iraq
7704155 not making the most of his education not studying hard not making an effort
7704156 if we believe absurdities we shall commit atrocities let us therefore reject all superstition in order to become more human
7704157 i believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as ive seen it in baghdad in particular and that if not stopped it is possible that iraq could move toward civil war
7704158 failure to apply coordinated regional and international pressure will further extremism
7704159 under your leadership there have been numerous errors in judgment that have led us to where we are in iraq and afghanistan
7704160 blind stupid acts that were were opposed by our best military analysts when they were proposed and those analysts fired
7704161 the secretary has lost credibility with the congress and with the people
7704162 you underestimated the nature and strength of the insurgency the sectarian violence and the spread of iranian influence
7704163 ignored the possibility of an insurgency from the newly enfreed islamacist factions and a whole shitload of foreigners who have trooped into iraq over borders unprotected by our insufficient troops
7704164 are there setbacks yes are there things that people cant anticipate yes does the enemy have a brain and continue to make adjustments on the ground requiring our forces to make adjustments you bet
7704165 is that going to continue to be the case i think so is this problem going to get solved in the near term about this long struggle against violent extremism no i dont believe it is
7704166 is that going to continue to be the case i think so is this problem going to get solved in the near term about this long struggle against violent extremism no i dont believe it is
7704167 balance between having too many troops and contributing to an insurgency by the feeling of occupation and the risk of having too few and having the security situation not be sufficient for the political progress to go forward
7704168 so in essence we dont know what the fuck to do now
7704169 i have never painted a rosy picture i have been very measured in my words
7704170 the army is holding together and the government is committed to bringing the sectarian violence under control
7704171 what i worry about is were playing a game of whack a mole
7704172 everybody knows weve got big problems in ramadi and i said where are you going to get the troops well were going to have to move them from falluja
7704173 now were going to have to move troops into baghdad from someplace else
7704174 it should not be lost on us for example that hezbollah fields greater and longer range weapons than most regional armed forces
7704175 if left unchecked it is possible to imagine chemical biological or even nuclear weapons being transferred to militias or terrorist organizations by a state actor
7704176 if we believe absurdities we shall commit atrocities let us therefore reject all superstition in order to become more human
7704177 i know what the president thinks i know what i think and were not looking for an exit strategy were looking for victory
7704178 insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results
7704179 if we believe absurdities we shall commit atrocities let us therefore reject all superstition in order to become more human
7704180 happy birthday mommy although you died and are no longer with me i feel as if i still have you in my life i think about you every day
7704181 drowning in the names of dead mothers fathers sons and daughters
7704182 the condition upon which god hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance
7704183 while the constitution protects against invasions of individual rights it is not a suicide pact
7704184 it is fundamental that the great powers of congress to conduct war and to regulate the nations foreign relations are subject to the constitutional requirements of due process
7704185 the constitution of the united states is a law for rulers and people equally in war and peace and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men at all times and under all circumstances in no other way can we transmit to posterity unimpaired the blessings of liberty consecrated by the sacrifices of the revolution
7704186 this is a good lesson about how frail our processes are its how we treat people in difficult times like these that is the true test of the democracy and civil liberties that we brag so much about throughout the world
7704187 the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias
7704188 yes thats my address but the name on the warrant isnt me
7704189 the progress of science in furnishing the government with means of espionage is not likely to stop with wire tapping ways may some day be developed by which the government without removing papers from secret drawers can reproduce them in court and by which it will be enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home can it be that the constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security
7704190 cut a great road through the law to get after the devil
7704191 id cut down every law in england to do that
7704192 and when the last law was down and the devil turned round on you where would you hide roper the laws all being flat

7704208 blocar no es su mejor condici n un buen portero lo mejor que puede hacer es quedarse el bal n y hacer callar al estadio

7704221 hoy por hoy a adi el piloto de yamaha el t tulo parece s cosa de dos aunque restan a n 150 puntos por disputarse as que los 50 que le saco a casey todav a no son decisivos

7704236 hemos superado las previsiones en un a o que se presentaba dif cil pero sobre todo hemos dejado claro el sello de futuro
7704237 nos jugamos el a o en este partido as que estar muy atento al comportamiento de mis jugadores no es para tom rselo a la ligera
7704238 hemos de estar pendientes de los movimientos del mercado pero tenemos la tranquilidad de que el entrenador puede empezar con lo que tiene
7704239 si sale alguien realmente interesante iremos a por l pero es algo que no me preocupa
7704240 el campe n de cualquier liga es un rival a respetar

7704250 estos juegos han servido para que el mundo conozca a china y china al mundo
7704251 una nueva era posol mpica ha empezado dice el rotativo la cuesti n es si la autoconfianza por la experiencia ol mpica empujar a china a establecer mayores lazos con el mundo y a reformas pol ticas do m sticas o si el xito y el silencio de occidente ante la represi n china reforzar la creencia de sus l deres de que su modelo funciona
7704252 los juegos nos han permitido mostrar con calma una situaci n de mayor apertura y autoconfianza tras 30 a os de reforma y apertura
7704253 los juegos han tra do una importante ocasi n para la promoci n de la paz y la armon a mediante la profundizaci n del di logo y el entendimiento mutuo en la comunidad internacional

7704262 hemos superado las previsiones que ten amos y se ha trazado un camino de futuro con el xito del petit peralada y de los conciertos de c mara de la iglesia que son un semillero para crear nuevo p blico
7704263 hemos pasado de los 30 000 espectadores de pago y esto es un xito teniendo en cuenta que unimos las cifras de los grandes espect culos con la oferta de peque o formato
7704264 pero esta se debe a que hay montajes de tipo medio como los de m sica cl sica y otros que requieren un espacio a su medida
7704265 seguiremos con uno o m s t tulos l ricos pero trabajando en coproducci n la pera es deficitaria la boh me cost 550 000 euros y apenas se recuperaron los 100 000 por taquilla la administraci n deber a apoyar la producci n de estos espect culos

7704267 i was just going to be up there for a couple of minutes
7704268 unless i do one of the big speeches the eyeballs watching are negligible its better for me to be shaking hands answering questions and talking to folks at the fair
7704269 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7704270 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7704271 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering

7704287 honduras tiene la suificiente independencia soberan a heredada de nuestros m rtires y nuestros pr ceres para decirle al mundo entrero que los hondure os no tienen que pedirle permiso a ning n imperialismo para suscribir el alba
7704288 deseo hacer conocer que este informe nos se ala que estuvieron presentes algunos funcionarios de la prefectura de pando y de otras instituciones
7704289 no utiliz la herramienta pol tica que fue la concertaci n
7704290 pueden formar nuevos espacios sin pedirle permiso a nadie hoy el radicalismo tiene en cobos en el senador ernesto sanz en el diputado oscar aguad y otros una alternativa de recuperaci n pol tica la ucr de corrientes estar en ese espacio
7704291 sanz aguad y el propio vicepresidente cobos son los que pueden llevar adelante una renovaci n y no hay que pedir amnist a ni permiso y yo estoy trabajando en ese sector
7704292 lo que pasa es que colombi estuvo pidiendo audiencias en la casa rosada y no tuvo respuestas

7704295 not the market or the cap size or the sector
7704296 we have come a long way from may when we were looking at a closure date of the end of june there in no closure date now
7704297 a lot of positive things have been happening but there is still a lot to do
7704298 if we want our ymca to become sustainable and viable the fee structure needs to change substantially in order to reflect the operating costs of the organization while keeping the membership fees comparable to other facilities of this nature
7704299 we cant definitively say its not listeriosis but certainly everything looks as though its not
7704300 we know they had some of the recalled product at the camp but that doesnt mean thats what caused this
7704301 what we have is this cluster of up to eight camp staff who reported being sick were in the process of following up with them to determine if they were sick are they still sick and if there are any tests we can do
7704302 if we find someone who is still sick well get some samples from them if were able to
7704303 we may or may not be able to make that conclusive diagnosis but the important thing is the appropriate steps were taken as soon as the issue occurred
7704304 it hasnt been confirmed that it was from our roast beef but precautions were taken and it was decided to shut down just to be safe
7704305 the public health department deemed that any of our staff had one symptom be quarantined

7704311 believe it or not i still play basketball i was never good at it but i can still carry the ball down the court and put it in the bucket that has helped me a lot
7704312 it has been a real challenge but i still attempt to live each day to the fullest and with the help and support of my family i have been able to do that
7704313 it felt like rigor mortis had set in on my left side something didnt seem right
7704314 we just feel that maybe we should notch this up a bit and see if there are any businesses out there first and foremost that are planning events but we would also make our services available to help those that would like to profile their business
7704315 we want to find out if there is interest in the town and during small business week we would advertise a schedule of events that would include anybody in the amherst area chamber members or not who are doing something for small business week
7704316 if the businesses could or had the opportunity what could that business do to not only profile its own business but to help others and potential entrepreneurs
7704317 if there were enough of those businesses maybe the chamber could look at getting a venue and sometime throughout that week put on a small trade show of sorts but we need to know this upfront
7704318 a lot of businesses especially smaller ones have maybe one two or five employees sometimes you can feel like youre swimming alone so this enables people to share and run ideas off each other and promote things that have worked or doesnt work and to share information on contacts
7704319 if they send us some information our committee will sit together and put our heads together to come up with what we can do to help them out and mesh everyone together to take full advantage of what the week is all about
7704320 signing niko just made me lock in and focus a little more coming into camp
7704321 i think you spur everybody on by signing people that can play
7704322 we know that niko is a good linebacker hes good on special teams nate had his best offseason program that hes had
7704323 he said it was going to be a fair battle and may the best man win clearly thats what he said and thats what hes done
7704324 that had a lot to do with it just being familiar with a position i played for the majority of my career
7704325 going back to the middle was a plus it felt like going back home
7704326 im not happy but the coaches said theyre going to play the best 11 guys on defense me and nate were battling for the spot and obviously we know who won that position
7704327 whatever they ask from me ive got to do each week youve got to prepare to be the starter anyway so thats how youve got to go with it
7704328 nate was a starter how many years here so he probably felt not disrespected but motivated thatll motivate somebody
7704329 its a day to day evaluation and hes got the nod right now we evaluate people every day every game well play the best players and you want as many good players as you can thats an example of having a lot of depth at that position
7704330 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7704331 we are all called to a better country and a better world
7704332 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7704333 so let there be the no mistake about it we are united we are united for change
7704334 ever since the 1960s washington has gulled its citizens and creditors by debasing official statistics the vital instruments with which the muscle and vitality of the american economy are measured
7704335 denial of the abuse of organ harvesting of falun gong practitioners in the face of such compelling evidence which has the official sanction of the government is no longer an option the only option which remains is ending this horrible crime

7704345 this is what youre giving me for insert special occasion
7704346 im coming to get my mothers day present and while im at it see how shes keeping your house
7704347 that may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut
7704348 the bar has been raised and you have let developers around the world know that if they invest the time money and heart into making and remaking some great games you will support that initiative
7704349 leeds were pretty hot tonight we couldnt handle them which was disappointing
7704350 at 12 10 we had got back in the game but we gifted them a try and then let in a couple of soft ones
7704351 but were not down and out it was a great lesson for us on how intense we have to be at this time of the year
7704352 we are starting to claw our way back and do some positive things
7704353 its great to see all the lads smiling and feel the joy around them
7704354 weve been through some frustrating times but were getting there were making progress every week but we still have a lot more to do yet
7704355 barack obamas been out here in areas ravaged by hurricane katrina to reach out to people and he has deep awareness of whats going on in the gulf region his deep religious faith and his background as someone whos come from nowhere you might say to a high position in the political world all of that i think bodes well for america i dont have any doubt that when we have a democrat back in the white house this january barack obama he will make sure this never happens again
7704356 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7704357 sen kennedy is in denver and plans to attend tonights tribute to him
7704358 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7704359 god willing we will perform well we will manage against all odds unless there is massive rigging any independent observer will concede we have an edge
7704360 capable of bringing change that will benefit the people regardless of race
7704361 i think its a test of who protects the malay interests the most to which party will they entrust the political future
7704362 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7704363 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7704364 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7704365 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7704366 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7704367 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7704368 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7704369 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7704370 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7704371 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7704372 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7704373 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7704374 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7704375 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7704376 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7704377 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up

7704403 having committed to obama it struck me that i might as well be vigorous in that commitment
7704404 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
7704405 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man its shameful dishonorable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church
7704406 i dont think anyone disputes that cardinal newman deeply loved ambrose st john he did say after st john died that the grief is comparable to a husband losing a wife or wife losing a husband but he did not mean that the relationship with ambrose st john was a marriage like a gay relationship it is simply wrong to read back from todays categories into the victorian periods when these very intense passionate but totally celibate relationships in oxford and among the anglocatholic community were very common
7704407 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will

7704410 portuguese players like all the glamour perfume look all nice and here people just get down and get dirty
7704411 this is bizarre but when you think about it it makes training so much more fun
7704412 the sport is also a symbolical mental liberation from the restraining yoke of being constantly within reach
7704413 its our nature to create fun happenings probably because our summers are so short
7704414 at first it was difficult to promote them as they were small local events where people did not speak any foreign language
7704415 but now they are raising the interest of foreign press and visitors probably because they are so different from anything else going in their own countries
7704416 with all due respect to the world cup and european championships and you know i love soccer you just dont understand the olympics how many countries are there at the world cup 32 the olympics has 200 and features every sport
7704417 my concern is this the badges that were issued to the psrs if i saw it around someones neck or i saw it on their belt i would assume and ive been in law enforcement for 30 years i would assume that that is a police officer
7704418 if that badge became lost and or stolen and its used im the one who issued it
7704419 do i think that theyre going to do anything inappropriate
7704420 i can understand why they might feel that way based on the genesis of the program
7704421 my decision to recall the badges have nothing to do with the psr program or the individuals who are part of this program
7704422 it has everything to do with following the law that currently exists
7704423 the only thing that i am doing is recalling the badges and we are in the process
7704424 were certainly not going to let it go on for months
7704425 theyve had backgrounds done theyve been with this organization for a long time
7704426 this person is closer to adlai stevenson than he is to bill clinton
7704427 were not seeing the human side theres nothing wrong with the big rallies and you have to do that and thats important but its equally important for us to get a sense of what hes like as a neighbor what hes like as a human being there needs to be a much more personal dimension than has been developed at this stage of the game

7704432 over the next 100 years the shape of our coastline will change and our favourite seaside destinations may not look the way they were captured in our holiday snapshots
7704433 i think we have a natural affinity with our coast and the sea but we all need to be aware that our environment is not fixed and that change is inevitable
7704434 my faithful google alert took me to your website on account of your piece on the daniel pearl award for outstanding international investigative reporting
7704435 as the media watch the world we watch the media
7704436 this is totally untrue we did not send any apology
7704437 we hope to complete negotiations this year officials have made very good progress over the past 12 months and have successfully resolved between 90 and 95 per cent of the issues before us
7704438 but as always the remaining five per cent of issues will be the most difficult to resolve with 12 countries at different stages of development negotiations are inevitably more complex and time consuming
7704439 we will take whatever time is required to try to achieve this objective
7704440 new zealands trade with the region has been growing at 24 per cent per year over the past three years
7704441 but it is not just about trade a key strategic goal for new zealand is to be an integral part of the regionalisation that is under way in the asia pacific
7704442 our internally managed business model was strengthened with the purchase of the operation and maintenance agreement for our pipelines in october 2007 effectively giving apa the resources to operate and maintain all its assets internally
7704443 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7704444 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7704445 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7704446 brendan has the support of the party room and thats the beginning of it and thats the end of it
7704447 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7704448 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7704449 i truly believe that peter has incredible economic credentials and its not for peter but its for our nation that he should be on the front bench
7704450 obviously we cant go to an election like that but were not there yet
7704451 what we have achieved over the fall and particularly over the spring i think its a remarkable record of achievement
7704452 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
7704453 weve organised five of these meet the candidates events across the shires because its harder for people to get information about local government
7704454 this meeting which attracted about 40 people was a good way to keep community informed
7704455 weve organised five of these meet the candidates events across the shires because its harder for people to get information about local government
7704456 our waterways are depleted and the towns along the corridor are suffering tremendously so we need to think of a way to create more water
7704457 desalination is not a futuristic technology it is existing technology and we have an inexhaustible supply of sea water on the coast
7704458 although the snowy hydro scheme is a user of water theyre not a consumer of water which means all the water they use to generate hydro electricity can be used by everyone down river across nsw and to adelaide
7704459 the first step to achieve is water recycling and storm water harvesting
7704460 proposals like mr lawsons would need an enormous feasibility study at significant costs to determine engineering and environmental issues
7704461 desalination plants consume large amounts of electricity and the proposal would require the water to be pumped 120km inland
7704462 theres heaps of twins about at the moment too because the conditions were so good back in february and march when they joined
7704463 id rather not see it actually i would prefer they had one healthy lamb than two or four
7704464 but shes trying to look after them with it being so dry it is hard for them to generate milk with no green feed they are only eating what i give them
7704465 on a cold morning with a bit of frost these guys do it pretty tough
7704466 merinos just have such a poor mothering instinct if you look at british breeds they take on foxes to protect their lambs but the merinos are just as happy to let them go
7704467 thats a seasonal thing it happens every year theres not a whole lot you can do about them either because their a protected species
7704468 but we do a fox baiting program before the start of every lambing season which is vital
7704469 i have been a part of the rlpb for six years and chair for two years so im very much aware of the rural sector and all the issues around the shire
7704470 more funding is needed for noxious weeds need and theres the issue of lack of maintenance for rural roads
7704471 i understand the council would prioritise road works around the main street in town but people who live out the back of jerangle would think differently
7704472 i am also aware and concerned about whats going on in town too
7704473 with multinationals such as woolworths coles and now aldi taking over there are not many shops staying around which is why we have to encourage small businesses to stay rather than imposing restrictions on them that they cant meet
7704474 we have not received very many unfortunately but there is still a bit of time and people usually bring them in later
7704475 we really lack images from the monaro and the images from this competition really help us expand our image library
7704476 last year there were a lot of entries and after initially narrowing down the entries one of the things judges looked at was where the images came from for those that we couldnt choose between
7704477 so it is helpful if we know where the photographs were taken
7704478 when i joined the raglan was only new and there was quite a bit of work involved to restore the building and get it ready for any exhibitions including working out the lay out of the room getting lighting heating and putting in a new floor
7704479 back then we held a few different events like garden days naidoc week and jazz events but over time weve established regular exhibitions like the tafe art exhibition the briscoe and lions exhibitions and the feast of poetry which help to keep the raglan going
7704480 the raglan has done an excellent job fostering connections with other art groups and the highlight for me has been meeting so many artists promoting arts in the region and gaining more confidence as a person
7704481 the raglan now holds regular exhibitions and between those we promote regional artists from the monaro south coast and canberra through solo and combined exhibitions
7704482 if this kind of devious tactic is employed for banking phishes itll make it all the more crucial that end users start to think about running anti phishing programs and browsers that have built in phish detectors because the stakes seem to have raised once again
7704483 e il coronamento di unavventura iniziata due anni fa a rimini
7704484 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7704485 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7704486 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7704487 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7704488 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7704489 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7704490 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7704491 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7704492 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7704493 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7704494 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7704495 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7704496 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7704497 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7704498 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7704499 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7704500 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7704501 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7704502 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7704503 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7704504 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7704505 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7704506 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7704507 es tarea del gobierno de los legisladores de los jueces de los empresarios de los educadores de toda la comunidad

7704509 israel afronta una amenaza muy real de ir n al igual que nosotros si ir n logra un arma nuclear le da a los iran es una tremenda ventaja en la regi n para continuar financiando a hizbol y ham s organizaciones terroristas
7704510 mi trabajo como presidente ser a tratar de asegurar que en cuanto a la diplomacia le apretamos las tuercas a ir n y que movilicemos a la comunidad internacional de forma seria contra su programa nuclear para aplicar sanciones de manera que ir n haga un c lculo distinto
7704511 lo que no es especulaci n es que tenemos que actuar con mayor firmeza y eficacia en la arena internacional para contener las capacidades nucleares de ir n
7704512 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7704513 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7704514 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7704515 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7704516 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7704517 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7704518 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7704519 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7704520 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7704521 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7704522 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7704523 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7704524 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7704525 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7704526 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7704527 where do you live what do you do names of your kids

7704531 in connection with the incident the intruder was able to get a small number of openssh packages relating only to red hat enterprise linux 4 i386 and x86 64 architectures only and red hat enterprise linux 5 x86 64 architecture only signed
7704532 as a precautionary measure we are releasing an updated version of these packages and have published a list of the tampered packages and how to detect them to reiterate our processes and efforts to date indicate that packages obtained by red hat enterprise linux subscribers via red hat network are not at risk
7704533 while there is no definitive evidence that the fedora key has been compromised because fedora packages are distributed via multiple third party mirrors and repositories we have decided to convert to new fedora signing keys

7704713 until you said that i didnt even realize it but thats right
7704714 we still continue to have a sharply divided court occasionally with some degree of sharp language

7704722 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern
7704723 there was a concern about the increased cost to carriers we accommodated that by reducing the speed zones
7704724 its disappointing that it cant be all that it could be
7704725 if we didnt lose one or two females a year
7704726 we want the speed to be slow enough so that the whales have a chance to get out of the way or the blow will be a glancing blow and they will survive
7704727 we continue to see no scientific or statistical support on the record of the rule making to show that a 10 knot speed limit for large ships around east coast ports will help protect right whales

7704732 they can adapt to one to two degrees of warming but if its more than that they cant adapt they are just filled with despair
7704733 as a live planning case i cannot comment on the merits or otherwise or on the timing of any decision
7704734 the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
7704735 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7704736 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
7704737 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it

7704746 sometime on 22nd august facebook took the unfortunate decision to restrict most users from accessing scrabulous
7704747 it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be a fair and neutral party took this step even though they were fully aware of the circumstances under which the mattel letter was sent to them
7704748 we now await the decision of the honourable high court and shall accordingly decide our future course of action with regard to scrabulous

7704777 if youre giving out two prizes theyre going to bellow and roth three then its bellow and roth and ozick
7704778 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
7704779 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
7704780 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
7704781 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs
7704782 in an even more dire situation than the active army but both have the same symptoms i just have a higher fever
7704783 i have tried to be careful never to say the risen book was irrelevant ive said it was a factor in reopening the discussion
7704784 for information about the rally or what else you can do to fight the genocide see with african union peacekeepers scheduled to leave darfur at the end of this month and the sudanese government mounting a military campaign against helpless and starving darfurians the horrific situation there may very well turn even worse for hundreds of thousands of people
7704785 i couldnt imagine somebody like osama bin laden understanding the joy of channukah

7704791 cause of death lies extremism incompetence corruption murder torture and hypocrisy stupidity and even more lies
7704792 the great red zone that voted for bush is clearly ready for war the decadent left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead and may well mount a fifth column
7704793 my daughter did this to me because i hurt the mother
7704794 i have to pray five times a day for what i have done
7704795 we hope to complete negotiations this year officials have made very good progress over the past 12 months and have successfully resolved between 90 and 95 per cent of the issues before us
7704796 but as always the remaining five per cent of issues will be the most difficult to resolve with 12 countries at different stages of development negotiations are inevitably more complex and time consuming
7704797 we will take whatever time is required to try to achieve this objective
7704798 new zealands trade with the region has been growing at 24 per cent per year over the past three years
7704799 but it is not just about trade a key strategic goal for new zealand is to be an integral part of the regionalisation that is under way in the asia pacific
7704800 eligibility for compensation should be linked to the severity of a childs condition full stop
7704801 this would end the irrational passion play we see today over whether the cerebral palsy was a clinicians fault and whether the cause was really birth related
7704802 some see cerebral palsy litigation as a sign of how hopelessly out of touch the courts are with sound science
7704803 at the moment we have a handful of families getting lump sum payouts every year which is great for them but we support a more equitable more effective no blame system
7704804 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7704805 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7704806 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7704807 brendan has the support of the party room and thats the beginning of it and thats the end of it
7704808 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7704809 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7704810 i truly believe that peter has incredible economic credentials and its not for peter but its for our nation that he should be on the front bench
7704811 obviously we cant go to an election like that but were not there yet
7704812 were only about a third of the way through the first term
7704813 the allegation is that he went around to a property there was an argument i understand there were alleged threats mr balmer said
7704814 if it had occurred they would have plucked him straight away he said
7704815 the timing and number of rrv cases in the darwin area can be very accurately predicted up to one month in advance based on rainfall minimum temperatures and mosquito numbers from our mosquito monitoring program
7704816 this is an excellent tool to more effectively control overall numbers of salt marsh and other mosquitoes as we can perform timely and more efficient spraying of mosquito breeding sites
7704817 it will give us the opportunity to educate people about where virus hotspots are at certain times of the year which will ultimately reduce the number of people who contract rrv

7704835 we know its probably joe biden all the signs are pointing to that
7704836 shores up the perceived weaknesses of the 47 year old obama who in his first senate term lacks significant foreign policy or legislative experience
7704837 first mainstream african american candidate who is articulate and bright and clean
7704838 mouth also just keeps going hes blunt and sardonic the downside to his fluency is that biden also has a long history of verbal gaffes
7704839 the true christian is the true citizen lofty of purpose resolute in endeavor ready for a heros deeds but never looking down on his task because it is cast in the day of small things
7704840 just because you go to mcdonalds doesnt make you a hamburger
7704841 whenever a new leader appears on the scene whether its a new coach a new university president or the ceo of a fortune 500 company a press conference is usually called to proclaim the leaders qualifications and potential
7704842 in the first reading from the profit isaiah we heard the mission that would belong to the messiah he will establish justice open the eyes of the blind bring out prisoners from their confinement lift up those who have fallen and heal the bruised
7704843 theres a twofold dimension to what is revealed at jesus baptism first he is revealed as gods own son and secondly his mission is revealed he will do the work of god identity and mission
7704844 so too our baptism perhaps caught in pictures or today even in video is something to be lived out each and every day
7704845 no matter what work we do whether it be a bank president or priest or teacher or student or factory worker we were anointed at our baptism with chrism sweet smelling perfume and we are called to take the fragrance of christ wherever we go
7704846 we are called to bring relief to people whose lives have been bruised to bring new sight to those who have been blinded by the false promises of the world to free people who have been imprisoned by the injustice of ignorance or prejudice to show sympathy to those who have lost a loved one to assist the sick and shut in to bring understanding where there is conflict
7704847 jesus baptism was not an end it was a beginning the beginning of his lifes work
7704848 what is our identity and what is our mission in life at his baptism jesus identity was revealed and his mission was revealed at our baptism our identity was revealed and our mission was given to us
7704849 at the pro family organization we were fortunate to have mike and karen pence as members of our board
7704850 many will say to me on that day lord lord did we not prophesy in you name
7704851 do we have real evidence of indianas 6th district congressmans faith
7704852 but look at us today security is above self respect we ask more money for less work we are weaklings who want the government to take care of us when we should be taking care of ourselves we pamper criminals and subversives when we should punish them and we condemn those among us with the traits of their forefathers as reactionaries
7704853 the agenda of the house conservatives comes first for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other a clear reference to matthew 6 24
7704854 the republican study committee is a bulwark of reagan conservatism in the house
7704855 and mike pence is one of the most distinguished conservative leaders in congress
7704856 clearly the american conservative union chose well when it selected congressman pence to deliver the keynote address at this years conservative political action conference mr pences speech was eloquent and stirring a principled declaration on the current state of the conservative movement in an era of republican hegemony in congress
7704857 acu has every confidence that under mike pences leadership the republican study committee will continue to serve as the philosophical rudder to keep the republican majority sailing a straight and true conservative course
7704858 rep mike pence cheerfully acknowledges this may make him the skunk at the garden party but he is determined to right what he and millions of americans see as terrible wrongs to eliminate the entitlement part of the prescription drug law they will introduce legislation to narrow the benefits to those truly in need the midwest lawmaker estimates that would involve about 25 of the new laws largesse many fear the prescription law passed in the wee hours after much arm twisting will make it difficult if not impossible to keep taxes low in the future
7704859 when the ship starts to veer off course or drift off course the crew ought to alert the captain that they sense that theres something wrong so that they can make corrections
7704860 if you dont believe in those things you can be my friend you can be our ally well work with you but you dont have the right to stand up and call yourself a conservative
7704861 men and women run for congress for a variety of reasons
7704862 as the unanimously elected rsc chairman pence represents a breed of republican not in favor with the big spenders of the current administration
7704863 pence won 67 percent of the vote last november in his east central indiana district up from just 51 percent in 2000
7704864 pence in many ways personifies the red state republicans whose influence will be felt both within their own party and on the national stage for decades to come
7704865 i resist the word moderate because it is a base stealing word for the benefit of gop liberals
7704866 i became active in hoosier politics in the early 1990s while writing for the indiana policy review a conservative think tank
7704867 republican party as expressed so well by president reagan but his loyalty to his party convinced him that he should follow the advice of his advisors
7704868 a christian a conservative and a republican in that order
7704869 a christian a conservative and a republican in that order
7704870 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7704871 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7704872 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7704873 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7704874 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise abkhazia and south ossetia
7704875 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7704876 the new policy would let agents open preliminary terrorism investigations after mining public records and intelligence to build a profile of traits that taken together were deemed suspicious
7704877 travel to regions of the world known for terrorist activity and access to weapons or military training along with the persons race or ethnicity
7704878 long term surveillance interviewing neighbors and work mates recruiting informants and searching commercial databases for information on people
7704879 race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
7704880 pretext interviews in which agents do not honestly represent themselves while questioning a subjects neighbors and work colleagues
7704881 obama joins senate vote to legitimize bushs domestic spying operation
7704882 although we have not traditionally worked with congress in developing attorney general guidelines and as you note in your letter we are not obligated to do so we appreciate the laudable and thoughtful suggestions we have already received
7704883 continue to train fbi employees in preparation for the october 1 2008 implementation date
7704884 undercover new york police officers infiltrated protest groups before the 2004 republican national convention california state agents eavesdropped on peace animal rights and labor activists
7704885 denver police spied on amnesty international and others before being discovered
7704886 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
7704887 the same information is gathered about foreign travelers but it is held for 75 years

7704966 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7704967 we hope that sharif will not cause us any pain nor that we will cause any pain to him
7704968 if the government is showing resolve they should be encouraged
7704969 if pakistan fails to overcome this problem the whole world will have failed
7704970 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7704971 i tried to bunt just to tie the game on the visitors side thats kind of weird
7704972 ive never seen anything like that and hopefully we never see that again especially when you lose a game when you wait this long
7704973 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7704974 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7704975 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream
7704976 we spend our time in a condominium in washington a condominium in phoenix some time over here in the state of california and then we have a place up in northern arizona
7704977 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7704978 the white house was saved by the action of one brave soldier john mccain
7704979 i know youve been asking about who i want to be my running mate
7704980 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time
7704981 barack obamas been out here in areas ravaged by hurricane katrina to reach out to people and he has deep awareness of whats going on in the gulf region his deep religious faith and his background as someone whos come from nowhere you might say to a high position in the political world all of that i think bodes well for america i dont have any doubt that when we have a democrat back in the white house this january barack obama he will make sure this never happens again
7704982 i think he could go your way with just a little urging
7704983 lets call him right now whats his cell phone number
7704984 hey ron your wife told me you might vote for me but i need to do a little work to show i have plans for small businesses
7704985 and then you have the antacid following right up there
7704986 you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7704987 america realizes that we cannot have four more years of the same ineffective approach to governing
7704988 it is the democratic party that can effect the change that america needs
7704989 will highlight barack obamas life story his commitment to change and the voices of americans calling for a new direction for this country
7704990 after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7704991 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7704992 let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads
7704993 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7704994 why is this important well i dont want to live through another republican administration i dont know about you goodness you know how many times can you yell at the tv screen
7704995 to get this far and see that as a loss i see it as a huge leap forward
7704996 if the tables were turned and hillary was the nominee it would be black people right now who would be saying im not voting for hillary i will vote for mccain or i will not vote at all its such an emotional period in our lives
7704997 the fact is we had a very hard fought primary
7704998 there are going to be some of sen clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7704999 love this country and they love the democratic party and they are going to be active parts of our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7705000 it may take a little time for some people to come around
7705001 has done absolutely everything sen obama has asked of her from day one of her endorsement
7705002 the glenn miller orchestra the greatest band of all time
7705003 we bring you the sounds of the glenn miller orchestra
7705004 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7705005 when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7705006 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
7705007 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
7705008 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
7705009 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
7705010 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
7705011 and wherever there are valuable resources there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them the logic is sound but the practicalities are complex and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability
7705012 several pilot studies have been carried out for research or pre feasibility studies in countries in europe but also in china japan and india
7705013 for example landfills in sweden dating from the 1960s have a lot of waste building material reflecting the construction boom of that era
7705014 and other landfills have very specific waste like those used by vehicle breakers which have high concentrations of aluminium copper and iron scrap
7705015 the value of these materials varies daily with global market prices and today there is considerable demand for scrap metal from china for instance
7705016 just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills it could be incredible

7705021 its not really that big of a surprise to us considering you cant throw a dildo in la without hitting a porn star
7705022 its not anywhere close to representing the voting age population and turnout of young people
7705023 young people still dont have access to the ultimate insider party apparatus
7705024 but it may be that being the candidate of young people doesnt mean more delegates
7705025 did a great job of including the young while some states like pennsylvania didnt even set a goal
7705026 were very much in concert on setting the start date later
7705027 enough to make it exciting and very disappointed if we dont get it done
7705028 i think everything will be on the table if we lose the presidency
7705029 if obama loses a view will quickly develop that the strongest candidate was not nominated
7705030 we wanted to make sure that we take advantage of all being together to try to elevate the conversation
7705031 theres an accountability system that theres a pressure system on the democratic party to adhere to its promises
7705032 it does make you wonder this blog culture that grew up outside of the traditional media are we starting to step up to the stage and be with them as equals
7705033 the dncc has been working with us as closely as well allow those are their words
7705034 it started that everyone was so excited then they got sick of each other and exhausted and finally we are ready
7705035 i was raising money in 250 000 and 500 000 increments from local businesses
7705036 i got some gasps from the other end i had to take deep breaths myself
7705037 we dont have a big fundraising base like los angeles or new york
7705038 diana has worked tirelessly with donors to assure that we have sufficient funds she is one of the hardest working people i know
7705039 we worked with speaker pelosi and house appropriations committee chairman john salazar of colorado who represents the conservative and mostly rural western slope said that he and degette dont always agree but
7705040 a great opportunity to showcase diana on the national stage
7705041 this is the crescendo as we change the landscape in this state and the west
7705042 for people on both coasts this has been flyover country but we have a story to tell about our quality of life with what we are doing on alternative energy preventive health care and transportation alternatives
7705043 we dont have the agility of gymnasts the power of a weightlifter or the endurance of a marathoner but we have more agility power and endurance than any gymnast weightlifter or marathoner we do your stuff almost as good as you you cant do our stuff at all and we do stuff neither of us does way better than you can

7705046 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7705047 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7705048 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday

7705052 federal authorities have scheduled a press conference for tuesday afternoon amid reports that a fortunate traffic stop by aurora police may have disrupted an assassination attempt against barack obama
7705053 an official speaking on the condition of anonymity says there is concern about the arrest considering the democratic national convention kicked off in denver on monday people convicted of a felony are not allowed to possess guns
7705054 federal authorities have scheduled a press conference for tuesday afternoon amid reports that a fortunate traffic stop by aurora police may have disrupted an assassination attempt against barack obama
7705055 its unclear precisely why authorities suspect the men were targeting barack obama but one of the officers who was briefed says he was told at least one of the suspects made statements to that effect
7705056 the secret service atf and the fbi are all involved in the investigation a secret service spokesman says the agency is concerned by the proximity to the convention and the items found in the mans car
7705057 law enforcement authorities have arrested two men and several law enforcement sources say the investigation is looking into whether the men intended to harm presidential candidate sen barack obama

7705067 smartphones will become a computer first and a phone second in the next several years well realise that weve gone through a second pc revolution
7705068 i believe that windows mobile 7 is going to be really amazing it takes an enormous effort for us to support that platform in all its permutations but thats our strategy
7705069 the nano is a really terrific cpu and you put nano with geforce together and everything works blu ray dx 10 games its low cost it consumes very little power its unbelievable
7705070 that were going to optimise all our software for nano and carry out compatibility testing for all nano platforms so any time you have a nano platform you can put a geforce in it and itll just work

7705083 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7705084 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7705085 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7705086 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7705087 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7705088 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7705089 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds

7705114 both obama and biden fit into the mainstream of democratic thinking on foreign policy and national security which emphasizes working with allies and using force as a final recourse
7705115 but because he is a realist he believes it is far better to take such actions with the support of our friends and allies

7705174 sorry for the lapse no problems here just nose down on work the car film looks good for the first 15 minutes still interviewing more people working on graphics and figuring out structure theme stuff wrestling with it all waking up thinking about it meanwhile the last couple of weekends have been filled with mom and family stuff went to woodland last saturday to welcome mark and tracy and samantha and ben back to ca after their cross country drive from va spent sunday moving rocks in the back yard at novato after the creek fence went up courtesy of the flood control district wishing i had more time to spend in novato but also needing to keep momentum on the film and on home stuff here as i get ready for ken to assume residency in the bedroom renting it to him while hes here working on kents remodel next door finished painting and now the edit suite is all gangbusters and also working at stanford several days and also working on groove projects for cisco and hp trying to keep head above water financially and meanwhile recognizing that i have been neglecting my friends you havent seen ernie since christmas havent seen carson in over a year i bought a franklin planner yesterday because i am so fucking tired of getting to the end of the day feeling like i havent accomplished anything i used to have a planner where i could at least look at the end of the day and see where my time went i hope it helps me because im feeling like im spinning my wheels on everything i know im not that is i know intellectually that i accomplish things and meet some goals and earn some money and occasionally draw together the tattered shreds of a social life but it doesnt feel that way it doesnt feel like i can stand back at the end of the day or week or month and point to an accomplishment or a goal achieved and nod with some small self satisfaction oy so now i have a planner the last one was accidentally left in a bart parking lot and when i went back to get it the next day it was gone

7705399 its icky to go on and on about how much you love shelfari without mentioning youre paid by them
7705400 when you look at a book on amazon yes you see a lot of people who have commented on that book but you dont really have a relationship with those people
7705401 they might be thorough opinions or reviews but a review by someone you know or associate with would carry a lot more weight with consumers thats what we are building on
7705402 all evidence points to a democratic convention that will have a take no prisoners aggressive approach all week driving home the contrast between john mccain and barack obama at every opportunity possible
7705403 this is a plebiscite on bush and republican leadership on mccain as bushs third term on everything mccain has ever said supporting bushs catastrophic presidency
7705404 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7705405 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7705406 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7705407 the outlying towns and cities of puerto rico like cayey are no longer sheltered from drug trafficking gangs and

7705410 i think its a test of who protects the malay interests the most to which party will they entrust the political future
7705411 this organisation is a terrorist organisation and has created mayhem against public life
7705412 the facts are pretty plain the deals across the border have led to a significant rise in insurgent activities here in afghanistan we know where these guys are being trained and armed to be sent to afghanistan to kill civilians and afghan and coalition troops this is obviously a political hot potato but we would be failing in our duty if we did not seek to counter this
7705413 i can only echo what president bush told the visiting pakistanis the other day that in effect information we share with them seems to end up with the bad guys

7705441 he still has reaction where once he goes for a little bit he has to watch it because it gets sore on him
7705442 hes never had a good offseason hes never had the strength hes never had the complete commitment to the offseason like hes had
7705443 theres a way that tennessee does things and a way theyve been successful they win a lot of football
7705444 im trying to just listen a lot and absorb as much as i can
7705445 i think as a head coach theres got to be a chain of command and people have to know where they fit in that
7705446 i think i have a greater appreciation of that now that ive had the experience of being a head coach for nine years
7705447 for westbrook to be the first back to rush for a thousand and catch a thousand passing at villanova was pretty darn impressive
7705448 hell have a little bit more luxury here than maybe hes had anywhere else hes been in that theres several guys that have that potential
7705449 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you and i cant tell you today wholl take the field first
7705450 i can tell you ill be comfortable with whoever that is
7705451 i would not be surprised if all three quarterbacks played at certain times
7705452 whatever the coach thinks is best we trust coach miles completely in our preparation
7705453 however hes going to handle it im sure will be best for the team and on an individual basis im just focusing on my job and working hard each day
7705454 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7705455 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7705456 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7705457 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7705458 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7705459 were trying to stay a little bit underneath the radar whatever you want to call it about not trying to talk too big and hopefully let our play do whatever talking needs to be said
7705460 i dont know weve got a really good team an average team or what i dont know yet
7705461 time can only tell if were a different team than in the past three years ive been here
7705462 those losses maybe got us some new coaches and maybe are going to get us over the hump thats the way im looking at it
7705463 we dont want what happened to us last year to happen again
7705464 weve got a lot of good players now that we might not have had before
7705465 we come in this year knowing that we can beat anybody i cant wait for the season to get under way
7705466 and if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7705467 yeah i sure do ive been playing a lot of football so whether you play or dont play in the preseason id be ready no matter what its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week
7705468 i was wishing i could play last week and it didnt happen and itll be the same thing this week im hoping im out there and if im not im not im trying to get better as fast as i can in the ways i know how its been making improvement theres no doubt about it
7705469 we were in there from about six to eight oclock with all phases going through evaluating special teams rating all the special teams so it was probably a couple of hours
7705470 every day we tell our players you get an opportunity to get better or get worse
7705471 theyve had a good three weeks of practice certainly well have a lot to learn in understanding the speed of the game and how fast its going to go weve got good leadership up front on both sides of the ball and were going to have to rely on them to lead the way for us
7705472 when we signed them we told everybody from signing day on to prepare mentally and physically
7705473 to prepare like you are going to play next fall after 10 14 days of practice well decide if you are physically and mentally ready to play and if we have the need in that case well play you and if not well redshirt you
7705474 ive done thousands of these is people humans infants particularly thats where this condition of cleft lip and cleft palate occur this was the first kitten
7705475 i have actually never seen a cat with this particular defect in my career and ive done almost 15 000 surgeries
7705476 what we wanted to do today is get after the cat had grown up to adult size is actually get full closure get the fistular that opening between the mouth and up into the sinuses closed
7705477 we had connections with a nurse who has worked with me for 18 years and her sister who owns the cat
7705478 theyre outside our door all day every day we never know whos going to show up
7705479 the great thing about this kind of run is that its relatively easy and inexpensive to build
7705480 people can start very small like we did and then let your cats dictate where to take it from there
7705481 he likes being close to us but he doesnt like us being close to each other
7705482 you can see the pressure building in his psyche until hes ready to explode
7705483 at times he cant not do it he goes berserk
7705484 the three sows after due process of law were condemned to death
7705485 hastened to the scene of the murder and by their cries and aggressive actions showed that they approved of the assault
7705486 i get asked all the time what is it with this humanization do we suddenly love our pets a whole lot more
7705487 says david lummis who analyzes the pet industry for the market research firm packaged facts
7705488 my theory is that its always been there but its been sanctioned now its not just the crazy cat lady its marketers and all of this consumer advertising that have made it o k to spend tons of money on your pet
7705489 as people are seeing more complex and sophisticated drugs for themselves they want that same quality for their pets
7705490 owners want their pets to be more like little well behaved children
7705491 since we cannot get inside the animals mind and since the animal cannot report whats going on not in a language we can readily understand all we have left are guesses and speculation fatally tainted by anthropomorphism
7705492 answer me mechanist has nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel
7705493 we have seen that the senses and intuitions the various emotions and faculties of which man boasts may be found in an incipient or even sometimes in a well developed condition in the lower animals
7705494 the difference in mind between man and the higher animals great as it is certainly is one of degree and not of kind
7705495 well give him an antianxiety drug and see what happens
7705496 ironically this paved the way for our school our behavior program and novel pharmacological treatments for animal behavior problems
7705497 so here we have zoey whos a yellow black mouthed cur 5 years old and you got her at 7 months
7705498 im already picking up that shes fearful and anxious and that usually stems from a disturbed childhood
7705499 zoey had her on the couch shes screaming at the top of her lungs and zoey just kept going at her hands
7705500 a serious bite is a risk factor for euthanasia for the dog which is why another component of the program might be some medicine if we were to ask zoey look if you slip up in the future and you bite someone like that again the chances are youre not going to come out of it alive but we can make you feel better if we give you some medicine like for example prozac would you like to have the medicine that might save your life and she might go grrr rrr rrrup yeah yeah ill take the medicine its a lifesaving thing
7705501 you superimpose my portfolio on top of his and its the same thing
7705502 by engaging in and winning aggressive encounters dominant animals drive up serotonin levels and gain in composure
7705503 hes just warm soft and fuzzy and he purrs and hes cuddly
7705504 as the dump loving wolves reproduced with each other their tameness would probably become more and more pronounced
7705505 has never had another problem since we put him on reconcile
7705506 we brought on this anxiety with him being so attached to us
7705507 now we have to break that bond without breaking it to the point where he wont know that we still love him
7705508 behavior modification by itself works theres not any question about that but if you use behavior modification in conjunction with reconcile it works quicker and it works better
7705509 a dog that lived on a farm and ran around chasing rabbits all day would be more prone to being stable than a dog living in an apartment in manhattan
7705510 a lot of the behavior problems we see are actually normal behaviors for the animal
7705511 if a dog goes to the bathroom on a bush outside you dont mind as long as its not your bush
7705512 but when he comes back to the house and lifts his leg on your chair its like is the dog mentally sick
7705513 were talking silence of the lambs here being in the pit so that you rip off your own fingernails and break your teeth because of the degree of panic attacks youre having do we really think that the problem here is a dry mouth from reconcile
7705514 i have never in my life had to resort to using drugs to resolve a behavior problem
7705515 we lead an unhealthy lifestyle and then rely on drugs to correct it
7705516 he would have been the ideal candidate for a drug treatment but to me that was unnecessary if you know some of the simplest things about dog training
7705517 the dog is creating endorphins of his own his own natural drug therapy while enjoying a totally acceptable activity
7705518 were confusing behavior problems which are observable and quantifiable with terms like anxiety which describe the dogs internal mental state for which we have absolutely zero proof
7705519 separation anxiety is a clinical condition in your dogs brain
7705520 what do we expect dogs to do when we go to work watch the telly do the crosswords or read the paper
7705521 in the wild the dogs major activity is looking for food
7705522 what most owners do is they feed the dog in the bowl and within two minutes youve stolen his raison d tre so now the dog is looking for activity which we label trouble and diagnose as all sorts of things like compulsion and separation anxiety
7705523 rather than the very general deadening of an anxiolytic or tranquilizing drug what i want is a very specific education effect to teach the dog how he should act
7705524 what people want is a pet that is on par with a tivo that its activity play and affection are on demand
7705525 then when theyre done they want to turn it off
7705526 training is basically about forming a relationship but for some people that interactive process is now giving the dog a pill
7705527 you can just tell shes waiting for something to happen
7705528 i cant live with this dog any more how she is
7705529 i am as big an animal lover as anybody ive ever met i can go on and on about how sweet and smart and emotional my pet rat is but we have to be careful about saying that when my rat appears anxious or obsessive that she is experiencing the identical set of neurological conditions that a human would
7705530 people have a physiological response to the thing they fear
7705531 they get tremulous their heart rate goes up they perspire their respiration will go up dogs do the exact same thing
7705532 humans respond to particular anxiolytic and antidepressant medications and we find similar responses in dogs to the same drugs
7705533 if it looks waddles and quacks like a duck then maybe it is a duck
7705534 we need to change dixies emotional response to the noise
7705535 there are fantastic genealogical resources that can connect dogs within a century for dozens of generations
7705536 all of the animals i see that have o c d are anxious individuals whove been in a rock and a hard place conflict situation in their lives which precipitates their condition
7705537 he went back to being a human being he was watching out for real dangers he was trying to go to real places he was concerned about his next meal he was thinking about where he was going to sleep and he wasnt concerned about the stupid beard pulling because now he had a real life when did the problem start again the minute he sat back in front of a flickering computer screen
7705538 all of the behavioral issues that we have created in ourselves we are now creating in our pets because they live in the same unhealthy environments that we do

7705541 last night it had thickened considerably and by this morning it had curdled completely the due date wasnt until aug 29 so im going to have to retract my good review of it
7705542 we feel that selling the edited register is an unsatisfactory way for local authorities to treat personal information
7705543 thats how bad it is it makes that noise even when its turned off
7705544 i was completely joking when i told a reporter that i planned to drop acid and what i said was ridiculous

7705558 the two founders of bon app tit come on site at least once a week
7705559 other representatives from bon app tit headquarters are on site every day as visitors its a very sticky situation the kitchen staff isnt being told anything when dinner is cut how many jobs will be cut too the thing that really gets me is that the googlers have no clue and will be asking us questions when dinner and other programs stop they wont know the truth either
7705560 agree with what i think otherwise i will fail you because i can

7705562 all men are instinctually trained to physically batter their female partners for sexual pleasure what do you have to say about

7705564 of course we cant legally advise you on this process as we have to remain neutral but unoffically speaking if you give me that letter ill give you a hand
7705565 did you want to know your grade for my class last semester

7705568 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years
7705569 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
7705570 what it will mean is that theres a recognition of each countrys regulatory framework in so far as securities trading is concerned he told abc radio from washington
7705571 practically that will mean that australian brokers and the asx australian stock exchange can direct trade on securities in the us and visa versa
7705572 so it cuts out whats known as a chaperoning arrangement it cuts out red tape compliance and reduces cost for australians and reduces costs for us investors
7705573 i just got clarification on that yes you can he said
7705574 if a brokerage firm or the asx have operations online you can do it through that format
7705575 i think there might be interest in both countries because it does reduce compliance costs and red tape and there are savings involved for operating through the mutual agreement he said
7705576 very importantly this is the first time that the united states has recognised any other countrys jurisdiction in the world we are the first
7705577 they have recognised that australia does have a reliable regulatory framework in securities trading such that the us will recognise australias robustness and regulatory oversight
7705578 therell be more liquidity therell be more flow i think broadly will be the improvement and therell be a reduce compliance and red tape cost in investment and thats got to be a good thing he said
7705579 were certainly interested in as many mutual arrangements as we can obtain senator sherry said when asked if china was next on his hit list

7705583 it was not quite the bodys rejection of the defibrillator
7705584 but its a means for a body to cleanse itself of something foreign to it
7705585 the lead in was the us market and the repetition of the bad news about the credit problems he said
7705586 this is looking like a consolidation pattern for our market he said
7705587 normalised earnings had dropped 24 per cent air new zealand fell one cent to 1 00
7705588 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which has said it may not work
7705589 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7705590 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both
7705591 the kids who are engaging in community sport a lot of them want to have the hope in their eyes that they can rise to elite representational levels as well
7705592 the government is funding a large slab of investment in community level sport school sports indigenous sports but also were not going to be back tracking when it comes to funding for olympic level sports either
7705593 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio program exposing tensions between aq al qaeda leadership and supporters
7705594 and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7705595 we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7705596 la ciudad que nunca duerme y que nunca deja de so ar
7705597 id be interested to hear from this school what prompted them to take this action because school communities by and large try to meet the standards that parents have in that community
7705598 sadly i think this is probably linked with the current society where litigation is rife and i feel that schools are probably trying to avoid a child being hurt and an irresponsible mother then trying to sue them for it
7705599 the issue around the gymnastics is around the safety of the kids and it was not motivated by any concept of litigation
7705600 so you fall on your head well thats a given and you get up and do it again
7705601 oddly working class values and the so called csi effect can co exist in courtrooms
7705602 and if that is proved satisfactorily then the government will have a look to see if other sites are suitable to be developed
7705603 ive just got to make sure i am fit and healthy for the next few games
7705604 well discuss how long im going to play against coventry but obafemi martins has now got an injury so well wait and see
7705605 i had a bad illness over the summer but i could have been really unlucky and had it during the season
7705606 ive been to maybe a dozen funerals in my life and i was always struck by how thered be all the people mourning the death at the gravesite and twenty yards away thered be two guys on a tractor checking their watch that was always really upsetting to me it also showed how different two people can be as far as where they are in their minds so that was one of the seeds for the idea of the movie
7705607 almost everyone had passed on it they all said make it a three act structure movie if i submitted it to a screenwriting class i would have failed
7705608 one thing that freaked them out for example was introducing a character that doesnt come back
7705609 garden state coasts on this considerable charm until it hits a brick wall in its final segments
7705610 this is not a perfect movie it meanders and ambles and makes puzzling detours but its smart and unconventional with a good eye for the perfect detail
7705611 garden state literally made my skin crawl i hated it as much as ive hated anything all year and only an unexpected adam sandler film festival will keep it off my worst of the year list rather than tell a story or develop interesting characters the filmmaker throws together dozens of scenes that make no sense within the context of the film largely because they were conceived by a young prick who collected random thoughts in a dog eared notebook over several years in the hope that one day his bloated smattering of paper would find a buyer
7705612 garden state is far from perfect but the things that do work exceed any excesses in braffs tendency to overreach in trying to inject heavy handed pathos into his silly comedy a little less angst would go a long way but for viewers who tend to attribute meaning though mood over substance you will probably come away thinking this to be a deeper experience than is warranted still it is original and perversely clever at times and in the world of romantic comedies if you can call this one that alone puts it head and shoulders above almost all of them
7705613 the real standout in the film is sarsgaard who seems to get better with every role he plays a character who is both likable and despicable at the same time and thus the audience hangs on his every move as we attempt to decide how we feel about him
7705614 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7705615 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7705616 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7705617 today we do not have ideal diagnostic tools for quickly and accurately identifying children facing tuberculosis which is a very serious illness in its own right and particularly so in the context of hiv infection
7705618 it is imperative that we help the medical field identify best practice so that clinicians can implement them to save lives
7705619 this project caught the attention of the selection committee because of the international reputation of the partners their focus on one of the worlds poorest and often forgotten countries and the importance of this work for millions of children at risk around the world
7705620 he wants the giallorossi because they are a prestigious side and because he thinks he would fit in well in coach luciano spallettis formation
7705621 decisions must be made according to sporting and not financial matters
7705622 you have to think about where you would feel better where you could gain more confidence the betis offer is very important for nery because he will be an important player there it will be useful for him to gain confidence and find his best form ahead of the world cup
7705623 i have brought you t master it took quite a lot of searching on your galaxys non holographic communications network but no man is beyond the reach of a sith
7705624 what it will mean is that theres a recognition of each countrys regulatory framework in so far as securities trading is concerned he told abc radio from washington
7705625 practically that will mean that australian brokers and the asx australian stock exchange can direct trade on securities in the us and visa versa
7705626 so it cuts out whats known as a chaperoning arrangement it cuts out red tape compliance and reduces cost for australians and reduces costs for us investors
7705627 i just got clarification on that yes you can he said
7705628 if a brokerage firm or the asx have operations online you can do it through that format
7705629 i think there might be interest in both countries because it does reduce compliance costs and red tape and there are savings involved for operating through the mutual agreement he said
7705630 very importantly this is the first time that the united states has recognised any other countrys jurisdiction in the world we are the first
7705631 they have recognised that australia does have a reliable regulatory framework in securities trading such that the us will recognise australias robustness and regulatory oversight
7705632 therell be more liquidity therell be more flow i think broadly will be the improvement and therell be a reduce compliance and red tape cost in investment and thats got to be a good thing he said
7705633 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio program exposing tensions between aq al qaeda leadership and supporters
7705634 and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7705635 we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7705636 the lead in was the us market and the repetition of the bad news about the credit problems he said
7705637 this is looking like a consolidation pattern for our market he said
7705638 normalised earnings had dropped 24 per cent air new zealand fell one cent to 1 00
7705639 these intense rains may produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides
7705640 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which has said it may not work
7705641 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7705642 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both
7705643 the kids who are engaging in community sport a lot of them want to have the hope in their eyes that they can rise to elite representational levels as well

7705661 primary continues to possess a strong long term outlook based on the opportunities presented by a favourable industry backdrop and the material synergies set to be realised from the integration of the symbion operations the company said
7705662 primary anticipates a strong performance in full year 2009 and is forecasting an ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation result of approximately 350 million compared to full year 2008 ebitda of approximately 175 million
7705663 the combined group is on track to realise an identified 95 105 million of synergies by the end of full year 2010 primary said
7705664 solid ebitda growth of 15 per cent excluding any contribution from symbion
7705665 it is anticipated that there will be nine new large scale centres by the end of calendar year 2009 giving a total of 50 large scale centres primary said
7705666 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile chief executive david kirk said in a statement
7705667 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7705668 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions he said
7705669 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7705670 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year

7705676 this is a sign that hes for all intents and purposes broken off communication with the prime minister
7705677 those three factors are really what impacted our result chief executive john mulcahy said
7705678 but we would expect the volatility of the markets to stabilise mr mulcahy said
7705679 we wouldnt expect credit spreads for instance to widen significantly from here
7705680 we would think over time they would contract to some extent
7705681 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately mr mulcahy said
7705682 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities mr skilton said of the exposures
7705683 its not to say were not watching them very closely
7705684 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment mr mulcahy said
7705685 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly
7705686 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations acting chief executive ian johnston said today
7705687 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth mr johnston said
7705688 we have not been immune from industry wide pressures including an economic slow down in key markets and higher grape prices
7705689 we are making good progress with our wine review but wont be commenting on our analysis or conclusions until the review is completed
7705690 vb remains australias favourite beer with the healthy growth of vb gold returning the brand to overall growth
7705691 we expect the beer market to remain resilient with brand innovation driving value growth
7705692 some very deliberate pricing decisions have slowed beer volume growth but strong value growth continues mr johnston said
7705693 ive been around long enough to know that you dont look at seven weeks and say its all over and things are back to normal mr luscombe said
7705694 the numbers that are available to us see us as the biggest player actually growing ahead of the market place
7705695 the numbers ive been looking at show our competitor growing less than the market
7705696 the mathematics of that means that the gap must be opening
7705697 were not in discussions with jb hi fi he said
7705698 we have conversations with literally dozens of firms every year and theyre done on the basis of confidentiality and im not ever going to betray that confidentiality
7705699 nato russian relations will need to take fully into account the implications of russian military actions in georgia
7705700 however we believe it would be a mistake to suspend all nato russia contacts when they are so much needed
7705701 we are ready to accept any decision up to halting relations altogether
7705702 we regret that this vote will only add tension in the region
7705703 we call on russia to live up to its commitments and refrain from acts which may further raise already very high levels of tension
7705704 this move can only raise suspicions about russias motives and aims coming after news of continued russian military activity in senaki and poti

7705711 ive heard this rumour and i want to spread it about without taking any responsibility for it
7705712 i realise this is a spin tactic and am going to endorse it without critique
7705713 the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london
7705714 listen i taught the first year med students at otago for eight years you think im scared of death death is nothing those terrible lectures in engl 124 on monday afternoons those were the test for me i remember that nightmarish first year i came so close to bolting from castle 2 one time the valium prescription had run out on me about halfway through the lecture and i saw in full intensity the serried ranks of those mean med student faces sneering lazily down at me from the nearly vertical rows of seats people at otago dont know how strange the atmosphere there really is by comparison with most real universities i had been teaching at university of california berkeley where students of 18 are grown ups and pleasant witty trusting grown ups at that to be faced by eight or nine hundred vicious provincial adolescents staring down at you on a sleety monday evening you think that after surviving that im going to be scared in moscow death is easy the med students are scary those were the most vile evil worthless excuses for human beings ive encountered in a long and checkered life its a pity they cant all be put to work shovelling the water out of the leith with colanders
7705715 to be honest im getting to the point where im ready to say fuck em they can vote for the goddamn nats if they want to and they can suffer the consequences
7705716 hey this is getting a bit boring how bout we spice it up a bit and turn this whole thing round make a hell of a good story on the day after the election helen pulls it off despite all of our shitty polling
7705717 boart longyears 2008 first half results reflect continued strong growth from both our drilling services and products divisions due to ongoing high demand particularly in mineral exploration the companys chief executive designate president and chief operating officer craig kipp said
7705718 boart longyear has seen little impact on demand despite uncertainties in global financial markets
7705719 we have managed the increasing cost pressures from steel oil and labour effectively mr kip said
7705720 we expect demand to continue to be strong in the second half and we are well positioned to meet market requirements
7705721 while we see some regional differences in total around the globe we are not seeing any downturn in demand for our products or services in the minerals industry
7705722 no we will not accept bainimaramas invite and we have stated that we will not participate
7705723 it is illegal and that has been our stand from the beginning and it would remain till the end
7705724 but when i really think back i can also see how the person she is today was formed in the experiences we shared growing up working hard studying hard having parents who wanted more for us than what they had and always being reminded that in this country of all countries those things were possible
7705725 we lost my father in 1991 and i know hes looking down on us tonight so proud of his daughter not because of who she married though he was a big fan of barack but because of the hard working brilliant woman she is what shes accomplished in her own right the mother shes become and the values shes instilled in her daughters
7705726 she has continued to follow that passion she gave up a job in a big law firm to work in her community with a group called public allies she trained a new generation of community leaders she developed the university of chicagos community service center connecting the university to the neighborhood that was blocks away but often worlds away from its gates
7705727 my sister had grown up hearing my father and me talk about how to judge a persons character by what type of sportsman they are so she asked me to take barack to play basketball

7705735 foreign stocks are an unnecessary luxury for most u s investors with the growth of globalization financial markets throughout the world have become increasingly correlated particularly in times of market adversity the higher correlations of foreign markets with the u s market in recent years and the convergence in national economic growth rates reduce the diversification effect of foreign equity investment any remaining cross border diversification effect is probably largely due to currency fluctuations unless your net worth exceeds say 5 million it usually makes sense to ignore foreign securities markets
7705736 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is

7705745 i think carolyn is correct santa doesnt make any scientific sense i think santa is what adults call a myth santa isnt real
7705746 because i have a loose tooth and i dont think that theres a tooth fairy i think that adults put money under your pillow
7705747 well that could be how could you find out if you are right
7705748 i could make sure this loose tooth i have in my mouth comes out here at school then i could go home and not tell my parents then i could put the tooth under my pillow and they wont know its there if there is no money that means there is no tooth fairy
7705749 mrs b i think my dad found out i think he could see something in my eyes that told him i had lost a tooth i still dont believe in the tooth fairy
7705750 the lead in was the us market and the repetition of the bad news about the credit problems he said

7705753 despite turbulent markets our investment and development divisions were able to produce stable income streams demonstrating the quality of the investment portfolio and the strong demand for our leading residential products outgoing chief executive greg paramor said
7705754 while we are in a constrained residential market across australia investors and homebuyers are continuing to support quality residential developments as evidenced by our record sales achievements in queensland and western australia
7705755 our results and recent announcements to the market show that mirvac is a robust organisation that is able to adapt to changed market conditions
7705756 residential developments have been exposed to the continuing poor sentiment affordability and mortgage related stress which adversely impacted some development values mirvac said
7705757 ah ben je vous avais dit quil fallait prendre une entr e et il ny a que cette formule
7705758 dont waste time our stay on this earth is quite short
7705759 these numbers verify the sense that governments are responding very late to vancouvers housing crisis
7705760 i think that this is going to be a highlight going into the civic election and the provincial election if critical parties and governments dont move quickly they will pay a price at the polls in november
7705761 and its not as if vancouver didnt know about it weve been raising this since about 2001 early on in the bid process we were painfully aware of the mass evictions that happened prior to expo 86
7705762 the legacy is going to be that vancouver will be horribly humiliated in the eyes of the world for being one of the richest cities in canada and having this ghastly homeless problem
7705763 we have built the economy of this province on one product which is endless housing and its simply not affordable for most people its a gentrified city what they so proudly call a world class city that basically consists of a bunch of rich people and a whole bag of poor people and not much in between
7705764 as a parent i wouldnt go out drinking every night and party with my buddies you would take my kids away and you would be right to
7705765 how can you honestly as a society look at 3 000 homeless people and think a partys more important its criminal and as appallingly irresponsible as anything i can imagine
7705766 for me the survey shows that theres widespread support for increased rental protection across the city across all parts of the city its a significant finding
7705767 im just trying to figure out if the government will be embarrassed enough by the people in stanley park or english bay
7705768 i dont think dixies been accused of running it up on anyone in the last 25 years
7705769 theres been years that we barely scored 49 points in a season it was a close game until midway in the third quarter once we got a good lead we tried a couple of plays we normally might not use but it sure wasnt running it up i just hope we can keep putting some points on the board
7705770 one thing about america if somethings good we overdo it
7705771 if it starts popping up all over america where we have 15 events on labor day i suspect that wouldnt necessarily be good
7705772 it started with the idea of maybe just having a few games and its obviously grown in the past few years
7705773 were not looking to make money out of this were just looking to pay bills so we can bring in great coaches and great teams to this state
7705774 i think four or five states that would be about it
7705775 were trying to get them pepped up for it it aint taking too much to get it done but were excited about the opportunity
7705776 no not really i think it enhances the high school experience
7705777 in fact espn is going to be spending more and more time on the grassroots of america with high school football and other high school sports
7705778 were not trying to take advantage of like lebron james were just putting an event on were trying to give these kids a great experience
7705779 monsters do exist in us and among us they walk in our shadow they can prey on us more as we fear them less we should know we created them
7705780 kirk called it an unreal performance and said it must be the new wide receivers coach from columbus thats making a difference in the passing game

7705803 bill clinton is a unique figure in our politics this is the only person the only democrat who has been reelected since fdr and is somebody who is equally adept at talking about domestic issues and foreign policy issues
7705804 now wednesday night most of the focus is going to be on foreign policy but bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and helping middle class families and it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why need fundamental economic change in this country

7705810 mccabe said madison has changed greatly since he first began working there in 1981 he said the way politics is done in 2008 would be unrecognizable compared to 1981 politics the culprit said mccabe is the large amount of money in politics especially the large amount of dollars going to political action committees pals organizations that take donations without having to disclose their sources while political candidates are required to disclose all of their donations and the law restricts how much individuals can give to each candidate mccabe repeatedly used wisconsin manufacturers amp commerce wmc as an example
7705811 in later comments state sen bob jauch said more democrats are needed in madison to bring about needed reform jauch was asked if the democratically controlled u s legislature senate and house had created any significant campaign reform after gaining control in 2006 jauch was unable to mention any federal reform he did direct some angry comments at wmc which has placed issue ads against jauch he said the wmc acted like the ku klux klan in bullying candidates take the hoods off jauch said of the wmc
7705812 there was a bloodcurdling scream i was just reading my book and all of a sudden i heard it

7705815 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer and yet im told that each of you acted swiftly calmly and bravely
7705816 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
7705817 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
7705818 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
7705819 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
7705820 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
7705821 we will do whatever is required to help them and that includes counseling

7705840 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7705841 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7705842 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp we have 27 confirmed dead including five women and two children
7705843 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7705844 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7705845 our people are inside kalma we are taking a leading role in coordinating organising a convoy of the wounded negotiating with the government and working to ensure a positive outcome to this crisis
7705846 we are in contact with all the parties to find a lasting solution

7705848 okay we just have to do our money laundering by check now and contribute to republicans
7705849 each time i play a grand slam i always think that oh this could be my last time playing here
7705850 ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future kind of holds and what will happen and i dont make decisions for the future any more from this day that im living in
7705851 but im so excited to be back here i didnt think i would be back playing you never know how many more chances youll get to be playing here
7705852 its obviously been a battle this year and a battle that its been hard to fight
7705853 i really dont have any performance goals because i dont know really what will happen my biggest thing is i feel like if i can stay healthy i give myself a chance to do well
7705854 i dont know what well kind of means any more but im just shooting to play well and today was a good step
7705855 just to be on this journey with my son has been quite exciting and memorable and i have a good time with that
7705856 i think a lot of things go into having the ability to win a slam
7705857 talent gets you to a certain level and then the hard work starts to kick in and if youre not putting in the hard work youre not going to get the opportunities to win a grand slam
7705858 ive really stepped up my work load off the court and started travelling with a fitness trainer i think thats the big difference in my game and the reason why i have the potential to come through and win a slam
7705859 i think even though federer was still the favorite for wimbledon there were still guys that had a chance of doing some damage there
7705860 i think its really exciting for tennis theres obviously quite a few guys that have the potential to win it
7705861 id still say federer is one of the favourites but in terms of being unbeatable i think thats a mindset that isnt great if youre going on the court believing that you cant win against someone
7705862 i think its taken a few of the top guys to see federer lose to lower ranked players to start believing they can win against him
7705863 he fletcher is great at making those runs into the penalty box
7705864 he has got fantastic energy and im really delighted hes getting the credit he deserves

7705867 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7705868 its really very hard not to think about the olympic games yesterday i was trying to go to sleep but i couldnt because my mind is still there
7705869 it is now obvious that we cant achieve significant growth internally so we must continue to find suitable acquisitions to add revenue and profitability
7705870 whilst the board of directors and management still have faith that zintel group can grow we have not yet achieved that goal
7705871 we have stepped up acquisition activity and broadened the scope of potential targets

7705968 i chose to get involved this year because i admire baracks involvement in his community
7705969 his experience in uniting people no matter what party and identifying a common problem and solving it is what we need to happen in the areas of health care the economy education of our children and ending the war in iraq

7705981 in fact we must take several more developmental steps to complete the system as it now stands

7705991 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7705992 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7705993 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7705994 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7705995 itll have definite benefits on the drought stricken areas but its not going to end the drought
7705996 and there is a potential of hitting the gulf coast
7705997 if it does go across the area of the drought it could be beneficial
7705998 if it goes back to florida it could cause more flooding
7705999 certainly going to go a long way to making an improvement that we havent seen in quite some time
7706000 we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7706001 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7706002 together we have known success and seen setbacks but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world
7706003 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the senate
7706004 i am here tonight to pay tribute to two men who have changed my life and the life of this country barack obama and edward m kennedy
7706005 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7706006 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7706007 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7706008 during our national convention we will demonstrate to all americans why we need barack obama and joe biden in the white house

7706011 show the desperate level al qaida has reached with members of one family driving each other to death
7706012 we would like to play a bridging role between developing countries and developed countries
7706013 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7706014 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7706015 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7706016 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7706017 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7706018 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7706019 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7706020 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could

7706107 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7706108 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7706109 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not because that would be speculation

7706111 i will tell you having visited israel a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon

7706137 the number of shares to be offered is based on the total current value of the mis project interests calculated at 438 1 million at a share issue price of 1 10
7706138 if the company is successful in acquiring all project interests for which offers are made a total of 398 3 million shares will be issued at this issue price representing approximately 55 per cent of the issued capital of the restructured company

7706140 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile chief executive david kirk said in a statement
7706141 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7706142 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions he said
7706143 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7706144 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year

7706151 shes the one that then suggested i might try 14 days prior to my desired flight time
7706152 its because of the money crunch theyd rather lose customers than money and as far as im concerned they have
7706153 the consumer is being abused its a shame its a dreadful shame
7706154 this reflects the strong performance of each of babcock amp brown infrastructures existing assets and the full year contributions of those assets acquired in the 2008 financial year
7706155 bbi euroports have increased ebitda by 94 9 million compared to the prior period reflecting additional ebitda contribution from the ports acquired during the reporting period
7706156 the australian et amp d assets have contributed ebitda of 83 3 million in the current period
7706157 these australian et amp d businesses have mostly performed in line with the scheme book forecasts for the ten months since acquisition by bbi after taking into account some one off transition and integration costs and the effects of warmer weather experienced
7706158 we have had a strong level of interest from interested parties in that asset
7706159 the true value of the assets is not reflected in any way in the current security price

7706181 he really was the publics senator and he has been all these years
7706182 he wanted to refer them to the best assistance available
7706183 here i was with one of the most powerful people on earth and hes telling me how to help this couple
7706184 wait till you have seen the garden it stretches far beyond that to the parsons field but i have never ventured to such a distance are you all out
7706185 it will not break but just look at all the others are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw they are the image of their father who is so unkind he never comes to see
7706186 i have no doubt it is a turkeys egg i was persuaded to hatch some once and after all my care and trouble with the young ones they were afraid of the water i quacked and clucked but all to no purpose i could not get them to venture in let me look at the egg yes that is a turkeys egg take my advice leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim
7706187 i think i will sit on it a little while longer
7706188 as i have sat so long already a few days will be nothing
7706189 it is very large and not at all like the others i wonder if it really is a turkey we shall soon find it out however when we go to the water it must go in if i have to push it myself
7706190 that is not a turkey how well he uses his legs and how upright he holds himself he is my own child and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly quack quack come with me now i will take you into grand society and introduce you to the farmyard but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon and above all beware of the cat
7706191 come now use your legs and let me see how well you can behave
7706192 look here comes another brood as if there were not enough of us already and what a queer looking object one of them is we dont want him here
7706193 all but that one i wish his mother could improve him a little
7706194 he is not pretty but he has a very good disposition and swims as well or even better than the others
7706195 it is a drake and therefore not of so much consequence i think he will grow up strong and able to take care of himself
7706196 now make yourself at home and if you can find an eels head you can bring it to me
7706197 ah you ugly creature i wish the cat would get you
7706198 but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family
7706199 you are so ugly that we like you very well will you go with us and become a bird of passage not far from here is another moor in which there are some pretty wild geese all unmarried it is a chance for you to get a wife you may be lucky ugly as you are
7706200 how thankful i am for being so ugly even a dog will not bite me
7706201 i hope it is not a drake for then i shall have some ducks eggs i must wait and see
7706202 can you raise your back or purr or throw out sparks
7706203 then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking
7706204 you have nothing else to do therefore you have foolish fancies if you could purr or lay eggs they would pass away
7706205 but it is so delightful to swim about on the water
7706206 and so refreshing to feel it close over your head while you dive down to the bottom
7706207 why you must be crazy ask the cat he is the cleverest animal i know ask him how he would like to swim about on the water or to dive under it for i will not speak of my own opinion ask our mistress the old woman there is no one in the world more clever than she is do you think she would like to swim or to let the water close over her head
7706208 we dont understand you who can understand you i wonder do you consider yourself more clever than the cat or the old woman i will say nothing of myself dont imagine such nonsense child and thank your good fortune that you have been received here are you not in a warm room and in society from which you may learn something but you are a chatterer and your company is not very agreeable believe me i speak only for your own good i may tell you unpleasant truths but that is a proof of my friendship i advise you therefore to lay eggs and learn to purr as quickly as possible
7706209 i believe i must go out into the world again
7706210 and they will kill me because i am so ugly and dare to approach them but it does not matter better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks beaten by the hens pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry or starved with hunger in the winter
7706211 there is another swan come a new one has arrived

7706222 i was at a party in palo alto on saturday night two doors down from steve jobss house and in the morning i was coming out with my bike and walked right in this is a content summary only visit my website for full links other content and more
7706223 approached by another young man who briefly exchanged words with hurtado
7706224 i had gone to the nfl for seven years and when i came back i thought the biggest change in college football was how much teams were training in the summer and in the offseason
7706225 more and more kids are going to summer school and working out on their own to get started early
7706226 coach lubick always made character a big part of his recruiting and this is a group of really hardworking kids
7706227 and theyre hungry too because the school had a lot of success in the past but these kids havent had that success
7706228 i can see where we are and i know where we can get to
7706229 im confident the plan is in place and confident we have the right staff in place as far as a timetable i dont know
7706230 but at this place were capable of doing what we did in the 90s weve done it here before and i think we can do it again
7706231 its special in that i went to school here and my wife nancy is from this area and if you get a chance to come back to where you played theres some passion and fire in that regard
7706232 and im kind of like a recruit too and this is a nice place to live
7706233 it just felt right am i the right fit i think i am some administrators that i knew before are still here and i was familiar with a lot of fans and the community and the university itself
7706234 there were a couple of road games that werent on tv so i sat in the car and listened on the radio i blamed myself and felt i was responsible if i hadnt gotten hurt i would have been able to help out
7706235 i knew he played quarterback here and coached here before but i really didnt know anything else about him
7706236 but after he got the job he called a few guys and let us know right away what was happening i was impressed by that it let us know he was in control right away
7706237 if youre a new quarterback you might not really be used to any system but i know if youre breaking in a new quarterback it could be peyton manning and he can have growing pains
7706238 we have to surround him with good people and get him comfortable
7706239 there may be an easier way to get going but this is a great game for both schools
7706240 from when i was here before i remember standing in the middle of the field and having 35 000 cheering for colorado state and 35 000 for cu its a good thing for the whole state
7706241 its frustrating because i want to be here and help the team but for me not being 100 to go out there its not just hurting the team its me not being 100
7706242 i was told nothing could make it worse which is why i wanted to pitch through it it just hasnt gone away
7706243 but the bottom line is we cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race which means that guys are going to have to step up
7706244 well watch him play watch him perform watch the level the team is playing at with him performing and see where we are
7706245 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7706246 these companies have gotten used to making money by cutting corners
7706247 unfortunately whats at stake is the lives of their passengers wed like to see more inquiries of this nature
7706248 and when the people hurting from the financial mismanagement of this country called for accountability for the crimes that have been committed against the people here against the global community against nature itself the democratic leadership took impeachment off the table
7706249 we felt that there should have been more inquiries into whatever biases and prejudices the grand jurors had before they heard the case
7706250 we wanted a fair and unbiased grand jury we wanted it returned so we could obtain one and the judge disagreed
7706251 it goes without saying that in many critical ways the grand jury is not like a trial jury and lacks numerous features that would safeguard the rights of a defendant
7706252 clearly addressed the possibility of prior knowledge of the case
7706253 the manner of his doing so did not deprive the defendant of a substantial procedural right
7706254 this is still in process and its not over until its over
7706255 its been a difficult case in todays parlance its been very challenging
7706256 probably not please dont mention it to mr kind i could get into big trouble
7706257 ive seen his polling and one day it shows him ahead by five to nine points and the next day theyre even
7706258 and i keep asking about all of those young people that i see out and around this state hundreds of them have been working on the campaign i dont think theyre getting polled because theyre walking around with cell phones
7706259 i dont think its a good thing to have both your president and vice president between them have 11 homes at a time when were in a housing crisis
7706260 we had to practise for a play and she did one on the grass
7706261 two teachers took her upstairs and she had to sit down for the rest of the day and not do anything
7706262 i said to the principal what if she keeps doing a handstand and he said shed get into trouble
7706263 i asked what would happen if she was a repeat handstand offender and he said that would be defiance and it could lead to her being suspended
7706264 mommy im pretending im poor excuse me is this the poor store
7706265 well i need some money i only have one money so i need some more
7706266 joe biden is huge he could be the difference in places like pennsylvania ohio even indiana
7706267 he can talk to the labor folk in their language you go in there you dont wear a suit or tie and you connect thats what hes good at
7706268 hillary was my first choice but biden was my second choice
7706269 he was one of the best in the debates and hell be a good debater
7706270 looking out from this podium tonight i see this diverse assembly of democrats as a testament to the strength and unity of our party and the fruition of our 50 state strategy
7706271 i wish he could raise more money that would help us but i have to say his 50 state strategy turned out to be just what we needed
7706272 the problem was not his concept the concept has been vindicated
7706273 it doesnt make sense to pick 30 states and say this is where were going to spend our money you dont know whats going to happen
7706274 i can tell you there are a whole number of congressional seats that are competitive today cause howard took a national strategy
7706275 virginia certainly has benefited from his strategy i think he deserves a lot of credit frankly
7706276 in appreciation of this most generous gift to the university and the
7706277 i want to thank my dear longtime friend who made the anonymous gift to make this possible
7706278 when he and jimmy talked to me about this i want you to know i turned into a lump of silly putty you touched me jimmy you and our friend that day
7706279 bud leonard is a well respected alumnus and retiree of lamar university
7706280 bud has a great love for football and for lamar as a young man bud played his heart out for lamar throughout his career and beyond he has been devoted to this institution its students student athletes and alumni i cannot think of a more fitting honor than to name this field for him
7706281 let me tell you what lamar has done for me
7706282 my life lamar gave me my life i couldnt have even thought about a college education without that scholarship i got an education that led to a chance to go to officer candidate school a chance to become a naval aviator a career in the advertising business a career at lamar and here i found my bride
7706283 bud was the organizing president of the hall of honor
7706284 the first meetings were held in his home we have a hall of honor really because of buds vision
7706285 i had grown up in austin in the shadow of the university of texas all i ever heard was how tough college was going to be and i was the first in my family to go i knew how to play football but i was scared to death
7706286 because of that year of transition i still had a year of eligibility left when i graduated coach woodard lamars new head football coach didnt seem too interested when i mentioned it
7706287 i thought he wanted me to serve on another committee
7706288 but he wanted me to come to work for lamar
7706289 finally it is my hope that coaches stan lamber j b higgins and my
7706290 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7706291 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7706292 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7706293 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7706294 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7706295 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7706296 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7706297 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7706298 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7706299 limited evidence supports acupuncture use in treating pregnancy related pelvic and back pain

7706303 we see opportunities in the sme space and have ambitions to grow market opportunities for partners were looking to develop deeper relationships with existing partners
7706304 we have good coverage in nsw and victoria but there are opportunities to build out our coverage in wa and queensland where we cant bring existing partners to those opportunities well look for new partners as well
7706305 we do not believe that the semiconductor industry can remain completely immune to the macroeconomic environment

7706347 thinks salesforce may be pushing customers to sign more multi year subscription contracts by lower prices which could be hitting deferred revenue
7706348 by the early 1980s datapoint was a fortune 500 company under immense pressure to increase sales figures its sales representatives encouraged customers to place large orders at the end of the fiscal year permitting the company to count the orders as revenue even though the money had not been received and in some instances the sold equipment had not yet even been produced when some of the customers went broke before paying their bills datapoint had to reverse sales or record substantial bad debts which caused the company to lose 800 million of its market capitalization in a matter of a few months in early 1982 the u s securities and exchange commission sec ordered datapoint to stop this practice

7706365 o our god will you not judge them for we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us we do not know what to do but our eyes are upon you

7706375 ante la furia que expuso el mono pweke los empleados temieron que el mono avance y comprometiera a los visitantes con lo cual como ocurre en todos los paseos zool gicos del mundo se resolvi interrumpir el horario de visita y cerrar el predio antes de hora

7706399 gimme shelter please people give my books a home a place in your bookstores and on your list and let me be a writer with a place where i can write in peace finish my books before i die without any more harassment or crushing of my freedom of expression
7706400 do what you wish i will write this book and publish it
7706401 i got no money but ill give you my loving for free
7706402 if i am going to have to waste so much energy trying to sell a novel that is far superior to their average book then it is worth turning my experience into a book all this writing and pain cannot have been in vain this story must not be hidden because others in my position will benefit from knowing what happened and what can be done about it these issues need to be discussed
7706403 what a noble spiritual woman and how transcendent our union
7706404 i was very shocked to find out the number of deficiencies across the board
7706405 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them

7706407 right at the time oil prices are skyrocketing were struggling with the economy were concerned about global warming and national security threats remain intense we wake up and weve got this abundance of natural gas around us
7706408 no matter how manly and adult like the younger man acts the conclusion is that he is still like a child
7706409 around 25th september they will release a song with a new style that is predicted to overwhelm the success of so hot
7706410 the way i do it shears are easier and it ends up the same
7706411 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7706412 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
7706413 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
7706414 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7706415 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
7706416 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
7706417 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7706418 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
7706419 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7706420 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7706421 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7706422 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7706423 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7706424 im not going to let it happen i just want to be heard and if something do happen they know im going to be looking for them i dont want nothing to happen then the school be like oh we should of did it this way why not nip it in the bud now
7706425 oh no i hope he goes to a better place i cant believe it
7706426 voters want to see a sense of urgency and outrage in their president outrage over our dependence on foreign oil outrage over our increased cost of living health care and education outrage over declining incomes outrage over an endless war and an idiotic foreign policy and outrage over our countrys loss of prestige over the last 7 years
7706427 you cant simply seek change for changes sake t his is an election with two choices the change seeking good guys or the status quo clinging bad guys obamas campaign needs to brand every negative attack by the republicans as just another desperate attempt of the status quo clinging to power
7706428 i dont think we ought to be honoring the mayor
7706429 i think if were honoring anybody it ought to start with the survivors of the storm and then the first responders then the neighborhood and faith based leaders not the government not the government
7706430 i am not disassociating myself from honoring survivors not from katrina ceremonies not from celebrating the third anniversary of the storm and not from bernardo i am definitely disassociating myself from honoring the mayor
7706431 i dont know at this point im annoyed so i dont know what im doing
7706432 i think the mayor has done a lot of great things i think hes made some mistakes but i believe he is very sincere i dont try to second guess things that happen once decisions have been made i come from a military family you support your mayor i think thats far better than to try to second guess
7706433 mr minyard was instrumental in the establishment and leadership of the city of new orleans emergency operations center working very closely with fema and the department of homeland security based upon his demonstrated leadership skills proven in new orleans immediately following hurricane katrina our expectations are that under his guidance responseforce1 will grow to be a premier provider of disaster mitigation preparedness response and recovery services
7706434 i believe my extensive experience and knowledge in the areas of emergency preparedness and response coupled with my demonstrated leadership skills and the responseforce1 teams unique abilities will be a powerful combination to drive responseforce1s future success
7706435 i flip a coin to decide on which building to destroy but in the end i destroy them both

7706437 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament
7706438 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7706439 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
7706440 who threaten the stability not only in pakistran but also afghanistan
7706441 the ppp also violated the latest agreement reached earlier this month that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf

7706444 we have requested saeed uz zaman siddiqui to accept our offer to become presidential candidate
7706445 he is a good pakistani who is a non partisan person
7706446 despite the break up of the coalition both parties should continue to work for the stability of the country
7706447 we will play the role of constructive opposition and will not create hurdles for the ppp government
7706448 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government

7706673 the agreement announced monday is the longest espn has ever signed and matches the length of the powerhouse leagues deal with cbs earlier in august
7706674 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country said sec commissioner mike slive
7706675 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past ap said slive added
7706676 were thrilled with the historic nature of this deal espn executive vice president john skipper said adding that college sports have been
7706677 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7706678 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure saban said
7706679 youre dying soon so we had better do this now
7706680 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
7706681 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
7706682 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7706683 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7706684 that was pretty simple but it became a huge challenge when the camera moved which meant we had to somehow move the entire generated beam with the camera while keeping the emitter point on the light
7706685 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future and to elect barack obama to the president of the united states

7706715 celebrate saratoga wasnt really serving the purpose that a chamber is supposed to serve which is to support and help the businesses grow and prosper
7706716 in years previous celebrate saratoga was the marquee event for saratoga residents had always given us great support for it
7706717 however it has to change it has to be a better event not just for residents but for the greater community
7706718 the youth of this city even my children are night crawlers they only come out after dark
7706719 one of the biggest reasons for the changes was to change the energy of the event and make it more of a pleasant event that appeals more toward the generation with more disposable income
7706720 what were trying to accomplish is to create a better business environment for our members and businesses of saratoga
7706721 so if thats what youre trying to accomplish then having a street dance in the middle of the night is not bringing that client to the city its bringing something else
7706722 the street dance has been a real fundraiser for the chamber because the chamber would not be able to exist without it were taking a big chance here
7706723 i just think this is really exciting to a see a work plan and a scope

7706726 some of these kids were so scared they just about wet their pants
7706727 i think its pure wrong that the students and parents were not informed of this
7706728 after a while of being called fierce and everything being a diva comes with the territory
7706729 the sound of silence the unprecedented decline in music education in california public schools
7706730 marys biography is similar to my own in some rather frightening ways
7706731 it sounds pretentious i know but the fact is that a composers duty is not to any particular listener or any particular imagined audience a composers duty is to the work itself
7706732 in college years ago i had big fights with young composers over this issue write me music i can love
7706733 i hope you werent stupid enough to be offended by what i said
7706734 i love the 19th century and the 13th century for that matter
7706735 the thing that i regret is that civil dialogue and civil discourse did not happen
7706736 thats fundamental to a university campus why it didnt happen is what were trying to sort out
7706737 but as the young man moved towards the camera into the aisle and took steps towards senator kerry he represented a potential threat against the senator
7706738 when this brave young man questioned this ruling elitist pig about the skull and bones he got jumped
7706739 the student andrew was about as loud as i get in public
7706740 and i believe he didnt because he wanted to see this poor kid punished for talking about verboten things
7706741 the police department said the situation could have been handled differently but the city attorney still is pressing charges a state investigation found that officer james flygare acted properly in arresting perry after trying to get her to cooperate
7706742 yes speechmaking that thing protected by the first amendment kerry violated the rules of the forum it is a question and answer session
7706743 hells bells even violent men trying to attack me i invite onstage one guy wanted to tell me he wanted to kill vietnamese i agreed and told him killing could be sporting good fun i even offered to have a toe to toe fist fight and would let him throw the first blow this being legal for me to then knock him good he laughed shook my hand and then happily sat on the stage for the rest of my speech
7706744 and so what if the young man hogged the mike
7706745 hells bells even violent men trying to attack me i invite onstage
7706746 i personally think its high time the citizenry rises up against the fascist state
7706747 once he gave them a forum and asked them what their issues were why they thought the way they did it turned out they had nothing intelligent to say for themselves beyond talking points and slogans
7706748 i wouldnt take a plug nickel from you at a salvation army kettle
7706749 i intend to go to my office on the first day of classes and if my way is barred to engage in civil disobedience

7706754 in the opinion of those opposing tenure your unprofessional personal attacks divert the conversation away from consideration of ideas and polarize and simplify conversations that deserve layered and subtle consideration
7706755 my reaction is that this was a vindictive intolerant and destructive act ironically by an organization and leader whose mission fundamental mission is to promote tolerance
7706756 even if the wall followed strictly the line of the pre 1967 border it would still not be justified the two peoples needed cooperation rather than walls because they must be neighbors
7706757 rubinsteins participation in this weekends zionist federation conference in london has been cancelled by mutual agreement
7706758 the zf regularly holds meetings where a wide variety of views are expressed and while there is no question that rubinstein has every right to express his views about israel it was mutually agreed that his participation in the zionist federation conference became untenable
7706759 the holocaust is used by zionists seeking to imitate hitler

7706764 met the publishing standards and the teaching standards required for tenure
7706765 was unwelcome and inappropriate and had no impact on either the process or the outcome of this case
7706766 some will consider this decision in the context of academic freedom in fact academic freedom is alive and well at depaul
7706767 blacklisting i will be barred from ever entering a college classroom again
7706768 but then i got really angry and said the hell with this and since then i just say what has to be said
7706769 why i hate jews excuse me i really mean zionists
7706770 in my view britain is not about race or culture

7706796 i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spent those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out

7706807 i want to make the choice between myself and john mccain as clear as possible i dont want people to be confused
7706808 i also hope that the convention conveys who i am
7706809 it is a great way to kick off the convention with the star of the obama family michelle obama as well as malia and sasha obama i think theyre just going to be terrific
7706810 and hopefully michelle will be able to talk a little about our family and what this campaign has meant and why weve made this commitment
7706811 i said mr president you can say whatever youd like
7706812 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and helping middle class families and so wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we needs fundamental economic change in this country
7706813 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
7706814 but more importantly my role is different now at the time i was a member of a supporting cast trying to make the case for john kerry and so i could structure a speech that was all about inspiration and broad themes you know this speech is different
7706815 i think people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago thats not the question on voters minds i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
7706816 i said mr president you can say whatever youd like

7706840 i dont call that the track record of a good corporate citizen
7706841 if we let murphy expand and increase global warming pollution and mercury were threatening the sources of thousands of jobs in wisconsin
7706842 better to do it in wisconsin where environmental standards are high
7706843 even if you have to pick a refinery with the track record of murphy this one might not be the best choice from an environmental standpoint
7706844 were right on the shores of lake superior it seems like a horrible place to have a refinery in the first place let alone a refinery expansion if we invested the same amount in clean renewable energy wisconsin could be a leader in providing good paying non polluting jobs

7706854 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7706855 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7706856 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7706857 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7706858 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7706859 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7706868 the angel of the lord appeared to him and said

7706870 god where are you get us out of this mess
7706871 lord you focus on the threats were going to stay focused on speaking your word
7706872 ive been told all about what you have done for your mother in law since the death of your husband how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before may the lord repay you for what you have done may you be richly rewarded by the lord the god of israel under whose wings you have come to take refuge

7706878 sure where what time and how long do you want me to talk
7706879 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7706880 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7706881 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7706882 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7706883 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7706884 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7706885 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7706886 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7706887 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7706888 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7706889 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7706890 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7706891 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7706892 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7706893 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7706894 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7706895 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7706896 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7706897 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7706898 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7706899 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7706900 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7706901 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7706902 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7706903 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7706904 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7706905 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7706906 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7706907 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7706908 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7706909 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7706910 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7706911 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7706912 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7706913 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7706914 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7706915 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7706916 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7706917 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7706918 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7706919 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7706920 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7706921 what about congress bothers me the way that kate bothers me
7706922 it could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native american criminal class except congress
7706923 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7706924 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7706925 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7706926 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7706927 if you think those guys have chemistry i think we have chemistry
7706928 it makes you feel good its just got a nasty groove to it
7706929 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7706930 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7706931 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7706932 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7706933 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7706934 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7706935 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7706936 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7706937 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7706938 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7706939 oh my goodness i could sneak up that corridor and be right on the floor beneath the stage
7706940 hey i dont remember who you are but i know youre important could i take a picture
7706941 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7706942 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7706943 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7706944 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7706945 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7706946 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7706947 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7706948 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7706949 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7706950 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7706951 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7706952 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7706953 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7706954 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7706955 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7706956 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7706957 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7706958 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7706959 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7706960 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7706961 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7706962 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7706963 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7706964 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7706965 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7706966 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7706967 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7706968 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7706969 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7706970 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7706971 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7706972 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7706973 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7706974 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7706975 no one works for someone we all just work together
7706976 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7706977 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
7706978 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
7706979 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
7706980 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
7706981 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
7706982 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
7706983 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
7706984 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
7706985 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7706986 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7706987 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7706988 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7706989 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7706990 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7706991 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7706992 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7706993 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7706994 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7706995 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7706996 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7706997 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7706998 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7706999 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7707000 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7707001 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7707002 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7707003 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7707004 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7707005 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7707006 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7707007 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7707008 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7707009 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7707010 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7707011 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7707012 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7707013 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7707014 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7707015 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7707016 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7707017 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7707018 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7707019 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7707020 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7707021 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7707022 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7707023 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7707024 this is a planning took where all things are going
7707025 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7707026 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7707027 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7707028 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7707029 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7707030 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7707031 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7707032 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7707033 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7707034 we were forced to sign statements that were only written in chinese translated only in synopsis in english
7707035 freedom house is calling on the ioc and the international community as a whole to review the entire process by which governments are awarded the games
7707036 the current criteria are technical and material and environmental but why not add respect for free expression
7707037 texas has an obligation to enforce environmental laws that protect the health and safety of its residents
7707038 industrial growth must be balanced with environmental stewardship in order to ensure a bright future for our state
7707039 were a responsible company we want to do the right thing
7707040 the sale of our dtv business is a key step in amds transformation helping to strengthen our balance sheet lower our break even point and hone our focus in order to take full advantage of our position as a leader in both microprocessors and graphics technology
7707041 broadcom will be a great fit for our talented dtv employees
7707042 we are trying to drive some value clothes in simple terms look good longer
7707043 texas case law recognizes few restrictions on the lawful use of property
7707044 is going to kill all the arguments about filing a lawsuit because you dont like the way a turbine looks
7707045 thats something you can objectively fight about in court but the issue of whats pretty and whats ugly we cant argue about that
7707046 hard to avoid the conclusion that sales have bottomed out
7707047 inventories are very high relative to sales rates and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices
7707048 there is still a considerable distance to travel before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market
7707049 its outrageous that our tax dollars are inflating executive paychecks
7707050 surely in these troubled economic times we can find better ways to spend our nations wealth
7707051 it was not quite the bodys rejection of the defibrillator
7707052 but its a means for a body to cleanse itself of something foreign to it
7707053 it was a naked reverse against the giants in the sixth game
7707054 he was close to the sidelines when rosey grier dick nolan and another guy all pounced on him he landed on one of those steel yard markers
7707055 thank god for mr rooney he visited lowell daily and assured him he would always have a job in the steelers organization mrs rooney would visit also she baked pies and cakes it was unbelievable art rooney will be with me forever i cant even think about that man without getting emotional
7707056 they wanted my husband to join the parade but the black players werent allowed they were also registered at a different hotel mr rooney was incensed he flew down the next day and told the team that never again would the pittsburgh steelers be subject to discrimination
7707057 he put me up in the dorm and let me eat with the players in the cafeteria his sons dan and artie were just as nice the warmth of the rooney family is something i will never forget
7707058 i remember mr rooney introducing me to joe greene he was bigger than life when we shook hands his fingers ran halfway up my forearm i decided right then and there i was going to play basketball in college
7707059 theres no doubt in my mind that art rooney had a profound affect on my fathers life far beyond football
7707060 mr rooney died in the house he lived most of his life in the neighborhood completely changed color through the years but art rooney never noticed
7707061 art rooney did things for the neighbors that they never knew like buy food and supplies and anything else that was needed my husband was also a kind and caring individual whose outlook on life was definitely shaped by the rooney family and i can see it now in all three of our children
7707062 meu deus dai ao brasil a portugal a toda a igreja muitas voca es como esta
7707063 the convention exemplifies the true rot of our democracy the presidential race gets almost all of the attention and every other level of government gets none because we have come to believe democracy is just a quadrennial vote for president
7707064 a voting system used in 34 states contains a critical programming error that can cause votes to be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards to a central tallying point the manufacturer acknowledges
7707065 russia did not want this crisis the russian leadership is in a strong enough position domestically it did not need a little victorious war russia was dragged into the fray by the recklessness of the georgian president mikheil saakashvili
7707066 more reliable in keeping americans safe during the twenty first century if the party succeeds in doing this it will also lay to rest the enduring myth that strong and wrong is preferable to smart and right
7707067 the key question who finally triggered full conflict remains in dispute the georgians said they staged their offensive only after russian troops began streaming into south ossetia and the russians saying they advanced only after the georgians began attacking south ossetias capital tskhinvali
7707068 even assuming that airlines improve fuel efficiency by about 50 percent in such a scenario the united states could go from having nearly 400 primary airports down to 50 or so
7707069 failures are only seen in a small percentage of all the chips
7707070 our competition has built a nice product but the nice things that people write about their product is that its well priced
7707071 its pretty discernible certainly desktop standalone graphics theyve seen improvement there
7707072 small incremental gains by ati more like onesy twosy were not talking about 10 point share shifts
7707073 the amd mobile processor business was not as strong as it probably could have been if amd mobile cpus dont sell neither do the nvidia mobile chipsets
7707074 at previous conventions the parties and candidates would hope that the video would be shown to the television audience and if you were at home watching you might see it
7707075 but if you didnt catch the video about john kerry in 2004 your ability to see that video was pretty much lost
7707076 the restructuring is all part of the company reorg to focus more on sales and distribution
7707077 robbie is pretty much ruled out for this weeks game
7707078 we dont think he will be part of our game plan it will be a week to week kind of situation to see how his condition progresses
7707079 we are pretty confident it is not going to be a significant amount of time
7707080 by significant i mean three or four weeks we are optimistic it will be sooner than that
7707081 we may change our sets and what we feature may change
7707082 whatever our best 11 are for every given situation we have a lot of flexibility
7707083 god willing we will perform well we will manage against all odds unless there is massive rigging any independent observer will concede we have an edge
7707084 capable of bringing change that will benefit the people regardless of race
7707085 i think its a test of who protects the malay interests the most to which party will they entrust the political future
7707086 being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is a gift from god and we mustnt hide it nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalised in ecclesiastical life this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7707087 es sin lugar a dudas uno de los talentos m s serios de la dramaturgia hisp nica
7707088 la gran cantidad de representaciones que consigue la obra alrededor del continente y el globo es en virtud del admirable talento del escritor capaz de representar el contraste entre la opulencia y miseria con una condenaci n explicita a la situaci n humana y mundial
7707089 yo vengo de una poca en que el teatro tenia una estructura identificable un s mil con la realidad el teatro era veros mil
7707090 desde muy ni o y en distintas circunstancias de mi vida me ha producido una suerte de encantamiento el descubrir el fascinante desdoblamiento de la personalidad que somos capaces de desarrollar los seres humanos cada vez que debemos enfrentar nuestra alma privada con el ojo p blico
7707091 general petraeus said in a letter to his troops my sense is we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our enemies in a number of areas of iraq we are in short a long way from the goal line but we do have the ball we are driving down the field is that what you expect him to say tomorrow
7707092 what law school did you attend and where did you place in that class and the other question is
7707093 i think most people understand that but at the same time if we work our way off carbon based fuels in the meantime this is not going to happen overnight
7707094 the two founders of bon app tit come on site at least once a week
7707095 other representatives from bon app tit headquarters are on site every day as visitors its a very sticky situation the kitchen staff isnt being told anything when dinner is cut how many jobs will be cut too the thing that really gets me is that the googlers have no clue and will be asking us questions when dinner and other programs stop they wont know the truth either
7707096 russia intends to inform various wto partners of its withdrawal from accords that contradict its interests
7707097 placing this hand around someones throat feeling his pulse accelerate as it raises him into the air and then he crumbles it leaves the victim wondering is he alive or dead

7707137 mccain is doing much better in several areas than a lot of people expected and thats obviously good for us
7707138 there seems to be a reluctance on the part of a lot of voters to back obama and thats benefiting mccain and our legislative candidates as well
7707139 i think most new york democrats are concerned about obamas slippage
7707140 i feel mccain is going to be very difficult to beat

7707163 use your male parts to carry a child to term
7707164 funny that hes being really careful and politically correct and mincing words and yet you know exactly what he means
7707165 while this seems at best insensitive and at worst a command to
7707166 so the joke is that hes big from eating applesauce
7707167 we felt like with the young guys that we do have theyre really coming along
7707168 we really wanted to be able to take a better look at them thursday at dallas it gives derrick a chance maybe in this final week to catch on with another team and maybe get some playing time with another team we felt like with the young guys we have were going to get the answers that we need in the backup roles
7707169 the evaluation process against dallas is not typical just roll them out and get through this game
7707170 there are some key spots up for availability for our football team both at linebacker and at safety critical spots and were taking a look to see if another defensive end or defensive tackle might step up as well its a big week for a lot of guys on our defense
7707171 guys are looking at it as a job to provide for their families so of course its an important week
7707172 we get more opportunities another day to go out and showcase your talents and see what you can do the way you perform and everything
7707173 its hard for a undrafted free agent to make your ballclub
7707174 hes fighting for a roster spot this next ballgame without question will determine whether he gets that roster spot or not but hes really performed at a high level for a guy who comes in as a free agent
7707175 we felt like he had some ability it was just a matter of how he would assimilate into the professional level hes done well it has not been too big for him
7707176 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate

7707179 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7707180 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7707181 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream
7707182 we spend our time in a condominium in washington a condominium in phoenix some time over here in the state of california and then we have a place up in northern arizona
7707183 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7707184 the white house was saved by the action of one brave soldier john mccain
7707185 i know youve been asking about who i want to be my running mate
7707186 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time
7707187 poc did work on cdma networks but we optimized the latest poc release to take full advantage of revision a
7707188 im in labor thats okay though this is my third i have twelve hours to wait so i might as well shop
7707189 if you be good well go get an ice cream
7707190 youve got a public that on some level has a complex mix of views on this subject admiring of women admiring of traits that they associate with leadership but not yet admiring of women in top leadership roles
7707191 if women are not distinguished from men in their view of men and women in politics then there is no hope for change
7707192 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7707193 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7707194 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7707195 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no
7707196 there are still a chunk of union voters who are undecided and there are some who are nervous about him
7707197 we feel that race is an issue its not the only issue its complicated by other issues such as unfamiliarity and inexperience but it is an issue
7707198 what the barack obama campaign needs to do is tell his story
7707199 barack obama has got to meet more with workers and go out into the schools and the factories and show them he is concerned about the situation theyre in
7707200 its all those other blue collared workers who are not members of unions that hes going to have problems with
7707201 but if he can convince us itll make it easier to convince the rest of them
7707202 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7707203 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7707204 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border

7707210 ordering samples online is becoming more common to make up for gaps in supply voucher use by doctors and consumers is much less common than internet ordering because it is not really getting at the problem of unsteady sample supply
7707211 we will see sample vouchers and coupons playing a bigger role but it is not based today on physician or consumer demand
7707212 a powerful inducement for physicians and patients to rely on medications that are expensive but not more effective
7707213 doctors will make decisions based on the patients prescription filling record and individual health record tracking past behavior through time on a patient by patient basis we will see a lot of money going into behavioral research medical students will be taught to recognize signs of compliance and non compliance and how to pro actively address these
7707214 this concept aligns well tactically with the shift of pharmaceutical dtc spending to support internet strategies patients feel more comfortable using and exchanging personal information on the secure limited access site you are building a web audience of the most important type a group that has opted to be marketed to

7707275 what do you do and how good are you at it
7707276 to me the whole point of engaging with music that has been buried by time is to eventually create something new
7707277 often particularly with very old music there is so little knowledge left that there are vast spaces to be filled by the imagination
7707278 as a teenager i spent several years living in middle earth it is what gave me the idea to learn harp in the first place when i turned up for my first harp lesson i was severely disappointed that huge heavy mechanized monster had very little to do with the mental image i had formed from reading and re reading lord of the rings then i discovered the vast variety of harps that existed during the middle ages renaissance and baroque periods and the fascinating palette of sounds they produce now this is what i imagined the peoples of middle earth would have played i was hooked
7707279 one lead to discovering what the music of middle earth might have sounded like are the music of those peoples on whose languages tolkien modelled his invented languages of middle earth gaelic and welsh were major influences and so was finnish estonias language and culture is closely related to that of finland the estonian folk tunes i chose also have a very personal signifi cance i found them in a book on estonian folk dance which has come down to me on my mothers side of the family they mix well with some german dance tunes from j s bachs time like childhood memories they represent my own personal shire
7707280 one thing we do know people played harp an awful lot in middle earth
7707281 tolkiens fictional universe is created through music it comes into being through the song of the ainur the angel like beings that take the place of gods in tolkiens world among the musical instruments that are mentioned in tolkiens writings the harp takes pride of place but what did the music sound like that thorins dwarves played in bilbos cave right at the beginning of the hobbit or the lament that lady galadriel sang as the fellowship was leaving lothlorien or the festive music performed by the harpers of gondor at arwens and king elessars wedding

7707312 senator barack obama says that he is a reformer an agent of positive change and looking at his record though in chicago springfield and washington i found that he is absolutely theres nothing in his record to bear out that claim
7707313 move with him from baseline to net without chafing or bunching up
7707314 balances his casual off court personality with the technical precision and passion he brings to the game
7707315 i am excited about evolving my on court apparel with nike to a polo and shorter length short
7707316 for the u s open however we collectively decided i would continue wearing the apparel ive been competing in all year its a decision we made based on the limited time ive had to practice in the new apparel between the olympics and the u s open
7707317 this is a week to really showcase what we do best
7707318 as an american what is worth dying for and whats worth committing american lives for
7707319 we cant right every wrong but we can do what america has done throughout our history and that is be a beacon of hope and liberty and freedom for everyone in the world as ronald reagan used to quote a shining city on a hill and so there are conflicts that we cant settle the most precious asset we have is american blood and throughout our history americans have gone to all four corners of the world and shed that blood in defense of someone elses freedom no other nation on earth has ever done that but weve also succeeded in other ways we won the cold war as i mentioned earlier without firing a shot because of our ideology and that communism was wrong and evil
7707320 people think im old im not that old yet so hopefully those healing cells are still in there
7707321 if youre not impressed with the white out youre probably one of those people who think the moon landing was faked in a tv studio
7707322 i would like to hear how anyone gets louder than the 21 620 that we have ill hold that to the idea that they didnt want to give us everything
7707323 hey lum i heard the made a brady clone you should get him

7707327 i left magazines to come back to newspapers and do the type of journalism that makes more of an impact locally
7707328 and now im being told that that type of journalism isnt what people want when theres big news breaking people pick up the paper because they want to know about serious issues i dont know how you can fill a newspaper with whatever it is sam zell thinks that people want
7707329 there is one aspect of the conventional codex that i regret in the case of history books it gives the impression that we have got history under control under wraps packaged safely between covers fixed in print
7707330 i would argue that every age was an age of information each in its own way and that communication systems have always shaped events
7707331 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7707332 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state

7707362 mccabe said madison has changed greatly since he first began working there in 1981 he said the way politics is done in 2008 would be unrecognizable compared to 1981 politics the culprit said mccabe is the large amount of money in politics especially the large amount of dollars going to political action committees pals organizations that take donations without having to disclose their sources while political candidates are required to disclose all of their donations and the law restricts how much individuals can give to each candidate mccabe repeatedly used wisconsin manufacturers amp commerce wmc as an example

7707448 it was very frustrating they came on to collect the passports at 5 30am all they had to do was stamp them but they took forever to process them some people couldnt even get off the boat because the authorities wouldnt give their passports back they were just stuck on the boat then they insisted on checking them all again the captain was furious
7707449 la gente tratar de evadir las cotizaciones porque haciendo cuentas notar que est cotizando dos veces una para su pensi n y la otra para pagar las pensiones del r gimen de transici n
7707450 no es cierto que eso se pueda ajustar en el largo plazo como dicen las autoridades econ micas
7707451 los recursos de ahorro se dirigen a alimentar el crecimiento del sistema financiero cerca del 20 por ciento est en papeles extranjeros solo un porcentaje peque o financia activos del sector por eso las esperanzas de un mayor crecimiento econ mico y de m s empleo no se concretan
7707452 porque ninguno de los dos sistemas prima media y cotizaci n individual ha dado resultados
7707453 porque 60 y 65 a os son muy bajas especialmente para las mujeres

7707458 hay momentos dif ciles momentos de crisis en los cuales uno quiere dejarlo todo pues la guerra que vive el pa s tambi n nos ha afectado pero nosotros venimos con un s lo prop sito trabajar a veces el sonido de las balas interrumpe las labores pero despu s meditamos y decidimos aguantar los malos tiempos pues por delante est n nuestras familias que esperan el fruto de nuestro trabajo
7707459 para nosotros este proyecto resulta un reto donde debe quedar en alto el nombre de la ingenier a colombiana por eso estamos corriendo riesgos no somos inmunes al miedo lo sentimos como todo ser humano y dentro de todo este proceso hemos tenido experiencias nada agradables como la sucedida el 14 de agosto cuando nos encontr bamos en una reuni n de socializaci n en el punto denominado el viso sector de los iguaes de pronto nos vimos sorprendidos por r fagas de arma de largo alcance duraron m s de veinte minutos ech ndonos bala
7707460 nosotros esperamos una importante inversi n social de isag n para amortiguar un poco las condiciones precarias de las comunidades rurales en el rea de influencia de los centros productivos de esta empresa
7707461 es por eso que se cre asohermosas una organizaci n comunitaria que opera en el rea de influencia de la central y cuyos miembros son campesinos de las diferentes veredas del ca n de las hermosas
7707462 los campesinos son los encargados de la formulaci n de proyectos participativos la idea es que ellos sean los gestores de su propio desarrollo
7707463 aunque la obra es muy importante y no se puede desconocer su incidencia en el desarrollo municipal la seguridad que el estado le ha prestado al proyecto ha tra do desestabilizaci n en la zona se ha alterado la convivencia y hay un ambiente de zozobra pues arrecian por momentos los combates los bombardeos y las minas as que nosotros somos como v ctimas del desarrollo aunque suene ir nico
7707464 el servicio permanente es muy importante para el desarrollo y progreso del municipio

7707468 ha tenido desde su creaci n escasas cinco reuniones en las cuales no se han conocido de manera completa los resultados de los estudios realizados tanto por la cntv como por el ministerio de comunicaciones o contratados por estos y por tanto no se han hecho los an lisis correspondientes que permitan a los integrantes del consejo contar con los elementos de juicio para formular una recomendaci n
7707469 resulta entonces improcedente que la cntv se encuentre decidiendo el est ndar de tv digital sin tener en cuenta la recomendaci n del consejo asesor creado para tal fin por la misma entidad
7707470 cada vez es menor la participaci n en activos de renta fija dentro del portafolio de los fondos de pensiones obligatorias del 92 por ciento en el 2003 al 68 por ciento en el 2008

7707480 el primer punto tratado en la reuni n fue la toma de control de la empresa tal y como establece la ley lo estamos haciendo pero queremos realizarlo de com n acuerdo con la empresa
7707481 queremos una negociaci n en un clima de armon a pero si tenemos que ir a otras instancias tambi n iremos eso tiene que quedar claro

7707486 proponemos informar a los socios sobre la necesidad de salir de algunos acuerdos que actualmente contradicen los intereses de rusia
7707487 al mismo tiempo nuestra econom a y algunos de sus sectores entre ellos la agricultura tienen una carga bastante pesada
7707488 esto hace que no veamos y no sintamos ninguna ventaja en pertenecer a la omc suponiendo que la haya y nos implica una carga
7707489 esto no significa que debamos renunciar a nuestra aspiraci n estrat gica en la omc pero hay que aclarar la cuesti n

7707507 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7707508 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running

7707510 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7707511 let us pray for her and the baby boy she dreamed of with her in eternity in her good care
7707512 when her fellow traffic agents came back from a stressful day on the job they could always count on donnette to lighten their mood with a joke or a funny comment
7707513 she grew up on an island know for its beauty and serenity and she carried that with her even as she walked the streets of new york city
7707514 barack obama may be one of the first people to inspire others the way john f kennedy did and robert f kennedy did

7707521 they threatened our lives threatened the lives of people we know of our family members and they told us that they could get us even outside of china
7707522 we were interrogated for periods of six to 10 hours a day in holding pens
7707523 two days into the detention we were shown a piece of paper written in chinese which none of us could read and told that we had a sentence of 10 days given to us for a violation of chinese law vague as it was that was all we were told
7707524 the markets going to struggle until we get a clear indication that we know what the bottom is in the financials and that may be a while
7707525 our biggest concern for 2009 earnings estimates is that a combination of global growth slowdown declining operating leverage a stronger u s dollar less share count reduction and a long tail to dysfunctional credit markets will create powerful headwinds for what appear to be very optimistic consensus expectations
7707526 they are all chinks in the armor when you put them together you can definitely start to see some of the stress on the hospitals
7707527 were just seeing a host of other issues particularly since last fall the investment markets have been really weak and a lot of the nonprofit hospitals have heavy reliance on investment income as part of their budgets
7707528 hospitals in new york never do as well financially as hospitals nationally
7707529 this is the toughest state perhaps in the country to operate a hospital
7707530 by the same token hospitals are more dependent on payments from the state government
7707531 the typical hospital in new york is under great strain
7707532 theres less of a cushion in new york for hospitals to have an unexpected blip
7707533 the attention of senior management is consumed by dealing with the operating cost pressures as opposed to pushing for innovation
7707534 tonight claire mccaskill will address the very liberal delegates of the democrat national convention she will no doubt fail at achieving the impossible convincing missourians and americans that the obama biden ticket understands their needs and the challenges our country faces
7707535 it is no wonder claire asserted thatthe low performance of the vacationing democrat controlled congress it is not as bad as it seems shes more worried about taking her kids to see kanye west 1 than addressing issues that impact americans lives claire and kanye have a great deal in common kanye claimed that george bush doesnt care about black people and claire thinks george bush let people die on rooftops in new orleans because they were poor and because they were black disappointing ridiculous and hurtful rhetoric that divides rather than brings people together
7707536 we worked closely with the films director kenny ortega hes so passionate about the cause and a lot of the kids were excited about it when we got there a lot of them were champing at the bit
7707537 you wont see vanessa hudgens and ashley tisdale because they were dancing on the set and filming the movie the whole time

7707546 overall median prices paid for single family homes and condominiums have remained relatively constant despite the decline in units sold last month
7707547 single family home sales in september were the lowest since february 2006 when there were just 248 sales sales of 414 condominium units were the least since earlier this year also in february with sales of 402 units we are seeing a slight increase in inventory in some neighborhoods so it is actually a good time for buyers to go out shopping
7707548 the housing market on oahu appears to be in a general slowdown similar to the mainland markets although weve not experienced the price declines
7707549 our market is most likely not suffering from a lack of consumer demand but rather a shift of buyers to the new properties that are available on oahu which are not included in our statistics this shift however is a short term event that will end after the new projects have sold
7707550 a typical upscale kitchen remodeling includes granite counters honed granite preferably stainless appliances a hardwood or porcelain tile floor and cherry or maple cabinets
7707551 if a countertop isnt honed granite its probably soapstone another soft material that so far has met with high approval by the person that does the cooking and cleaning
7707552 after being on the market for a couple of years warming drawers are more beloved than ever
7707553 in the middle of last year there was a slowdown
7707554 everyone started panicking but by the end of the year things started turning around
7707555 we just feel that the economy is strong enough and with the constraints on new supply for office space that were going to see a significant runup in rental rates
7707556 even though this is our first investment in hawaii we probably looked at four or five of the last office opportunities in honolulu

7707581 the shuttles were inverted with the black orbiter the classified mission on top and the white orbiter on the bottom it was an inside joke by the all military crew about the true nature of their mission

7707602 holy shit im a grownup professional im being taken so seriously and it seems like just yesterday the bike cops were chasing me out of west market square
7707603 i think a lot of things go into having the ability to win a slam
7707604 talent gets you to a certain level and then the hard work starts to kick in and if youre not putting in the hard work youre not going to get the opportunities to win a grand slam
7707605 ive really stepped up my work load off the court and started travelling with a fitness trainer i think thats the big difference in my game and the reason why i have the potential to come through and win a slam
7707606 i think even though federer was still the favorite for wimbledon there were still guys that had a chance of doing some damage there
7707607 i think its really exciting for tennis theres obviously quite a few guys that have the potential to win it
7707608 id still say federer is one of the favourites but in terms of being unbeatable i think thats a mindset that isnt great if youre going on the court believing that you cant win against someone
7707609 i think its taken a few of the top guys to see federer lose to lower ranked players to start believing they can win against him
7707610 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7707611 based on a specific time deadline for the withdrawal of foreign forces so that the time period shall not remain open
7707612 until we have a final agreement an agreement that has been approved we dont have an agreement
7707613 unless they change it will be difficult to have the agreement approved

7707620 the pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around him when they had come from jerusalem 2 and had seen that some of his disciples were eating their bread with impure hands that is unwashed
7707621 why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders but eat their bread with impure hands
7707622 rightly did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far away from me
7707623 neglecting the commandment of god you hold to the tradition of men
7707624 you are experts at setting aside the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition
7707625 for moses said honor your father and your mother and he who speaks evil of father or mother is to be put to death 11 but you say if a man says to his father or his mother whatever i have that would help you is corban that is to say given to god 12 you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother 13 thus invalidating the word of god by your tradition which you have handed down and you do many things such as that
7707626 listen to me all of you and understand 15 there is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man
7707627 are you so lacking in understanding also do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him 19 because it does not go into his heart but into his stomach and is eliminated
7707628 that which proceeds out of the man that is what defiles the man
7707629 for from within out of the heart of men proceed the evil thoughts fornications thefts murders adulteries 22 deeds of coveting and wickedness as well as deceit sensuality envy slander pride and foolishness
7707630 all these evil things proceed from within and defile the man

7707648 resort operator jennifer speaking how may i direct your call
7707649 hi jen this is mr klein can you please put me through to naam
7707650 we love the underdog the brits but when you drill down deep into the psyche of the individual we want to be winners
7707651 i dont think we could have contributed in any other way to exciting the nation about us becoming the next hosts of the olympic games in 2012
7707652 the whole country has woken up to the fact its us next and it is going to be a hell of a show in london in 2012
7707653 all of us will be back in training in a months time back to the real world and the hard graft
7707654 but it is only going to help to spur the rest of the team on to keep training through the next four years up until the london olympics
7707655 it is so timely we were able to get this result now and do so well and get the nation really behind the games
7707656 in my experience that will make the difference between london being a great games or not how the british public will react to it
7707657 you saw in sydney how the australians got behind the 2000 games and you saw a fantastic home performance by their team and again in china it is great to get home to such a reception and now the next four years hard work start now
7707658 from what ive seen there is so much money and facilities and great coaching and support staff coming into britain and helping us out i dont see how it can get worse
7707659 nosotros decidimos retomar esta norma que alguna vez fue derogada ya que cada d a somos testigos de una mayor agresividad y mayor maltrato hacia la polic a y no hab a una norma que los protegiera

7707662 vegie burgers are nothing new but they have gone mainstream and in the process for the most part theyve become worse
7707663 vegetables legumes and nuts dont have the connective tissue that helps hold meat patties together so they require a little binder to create a cohesive mass that can be shaped and handled the idea is to use ingredients that bridge the gap between liquids and solids by capturing the moisture
7707664 there are three secrets to a vegie burger with a crisp outer crust and a tender interior be sure there is enough hot fat in the pan before cooking let the patties cook on one side until they are nicely browned and dont overcook you want them hot but not dry
7707665 we are concerned by indiscriminate weapons fire by sudanese government forces on the kalma internally displaced persons camp in south darfur sudan
7707666 attacks on vulnerable populations in sudan are deplorable and violate international law
7707667 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
7707668 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7707669 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7707670 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7707671 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp we have 27 confirmed dead including five women and two children
7707672 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7707673 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7707674 our people are inside kalma we are taking a leading role in coordinating organising a convoy of the wounded negotiating with the government and working to ensure a positive outcome to this crisis
7707675 we are in contact with all the parties to find a lasting solution
7707676 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7707677 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7707678 i just dont know what else to do do you have another solution
7707679 im so sorry we tried she is just too much of a liability
7707680 the americans with disabilities act ada prohibits discrimination on the basis of a disability for many private businesses including daycare centers with the exception of church operated programs this means that child care programs including family daycare homes must make reasonable accommodations to give children with disabilities equal access to program participation reasonable accomodations may include revision of policies and procedures removal of physical barriers provision of adaptive equipment curriculum adaptations changes in staffing patterns and additional staff training
7707681 youll see folks in no uncertain terms lay down exactly the differences between barack obama and john mccain
7707682 make sure the know who barack obama is and where hes going to take this country and let people know the crystal clear choice between obama who wants to fundamentally change business as usual in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same
7707683 he either forgot how many houses he has misplaced the keys to those houses or he just wasnt being truthful with those reporters
7707684 weve got members who are losing their homes and he cant even keep track
7707685 in the weeks ahead lets be optimists not just opponents lets build unity in the american family not angry division lets honor this nations diversity lets respect one another
7707686 the courts reasoning is like saying that you can get away with murder if you pay the hit man with a check
7707687 it means every crime ronnie earle indicted tom delay for was not a crime
7707688 what lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us
7707689 enthusiasm is that secret and harmonious spirit which hovers over the production of genius
7707690 a man can succeed at almost anything for which he has unlimited enthusiasm
7707691 a mediocre idea that generates enthusiasm will go farther than a great idea that inspires no one
7707692 most great men and women are not perfectly rounded in their personalities but are instead people whose one driving enthusiasm is so great it makes their faults seem insignificant
7707693 flaming enthusiasm backed by horse sense and persistence is the quality that most frequently makes for success
7707694 in the end the size of a persons accomplishment can best be measured by the size of their heart
7707695 no person who is enthusiastic about his work has anything to fear from life
7707696 there is real magic in enthusiasm it spells the difference between mediocrity and accomplishment
7707697 enthusiasm is the greatest asset in the world it beats money power and influence

7707701 we felt that there should have been more inquiries into whatever biases and prejudices the grand jurors had before they heard the case
7707702 we wanted a fair and unbiased grand jury we wanted it returned so we could obtain one and the judge disagreed
7707703 it goes without saying that in many critical ways the grand jury is not like a trial jury and lacks numerous features that would safeguard the rights of a defendant
7707704 boart longyears 2008 first half results reflect continued strong growth from both our drilling services and products divisions due to ongoing high demand particularly in mineral exploration chief executive designate president and chief operating officer craig kipp said
7707705 boart longyear has seen little impact on demand despite uncertainties in global financial markets
7707706 our products business has the strongest backlog we have seen and on our mineral exploration side which is the 1200 rigs that we have around the world we continue to see very high utilisation mr kipp said
7707707 we dont have any rigs sitting idle were very vigilant and looking for more work
7707708 we hear that demand is going down in china but so far for the first half of the year we remain very busy
7707709 we expect demand to continue to be strong in the second half
7707710 while we see some regional differences around the globe we are not seeing any downturn in demand for our products or services in the minerals industry
7707711 i say a little bit broadly that were looking all over the world mr brunner said
7707712 were trying to improve our footprint our market position in established and long term markets
7707713 we continue to look in australia for opportunities and if we find one that is both accretive to us has a genuine value to the business and genuinely wants to be part of boart longyear then well pursue it
7707714 were talking to a large number of people and are going to grow through acquisition
7707715 we see this as a good market for acquisitions we have the cashflow to do it and we see markets in the world that we want to get into
7707716 we know that more and more professionals are open to the idea of meeting interesting people while theyre on business trips provided that the setting is discreet and tasteful
7707717 dear sirs last year when i filed my taxes i deliberately misrepresented my income now i cannot sleep enclosed is a check for 150 00 if i still cant sleep i will gladly send you the rest
7707718 live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day he visits us
7707719 bloodthirsty men hate a man of integrity and seek to kill the upright
7707720 the crucible for silver and the furnace for gold but man is tested by the praise he receives
7707721 when it actually became available i thought this is just absolutely perfect i love the nature of the business
7707722 i look at the dating industry as an hr strategy as well because when someones happy in their home life theyre definitely more productive in the business
7707723 the dating industry is definitely in a growth pattern right now
7707724 people come to us because of confidentiality for starters and they want to know that the people that they meet are in fact who they say they are their photos are not online their profiles are not online they know that weve met everyone face to face
7707725 people are really busy these days people travel for business theyre working from 7 in the morning to 8 oclock at night they dont have time often to meet people
7707726 we will help and they were eager to help but a year had gone by
7707727 a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop but the one who plants generously will get a generous crop
7707728 forge your tongue on the anvil of truth and what flies up though it be but a spark will have light
7707729 i wanted that vase for my collection and you have ruined it by your carelessness
7707730 sir there are other ruined things more precious than a vase which can never be restored you can never give back to that young man who just left us the reverence for sacred things which his parents have tried to teach him for years you have un done their labor in less than half an hour
7707731 oh well my life here is safe and the food is good
7707732 you are worried and upset about many things but only one thing is needed
7707733 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7707734 buffalo theyre spending more time shoveling out than going out
7707735 oh thats too bad that will be a big deduction
7707736 it was a pagan city with idolatry and immorality dominating its religious social life the uncovered archaeological ruins of ancient ephesus are amazing to behold one of the first things to strike the tourist is the size of the city this was no small village but a major metropolitan area with perhaps as many as 500 000 inhabitants the roman amphitheater seats 25 000 people with an acoustical design that eliminates the need for microphones one can imagine it crowded with people shouting great is artemis diana of the ephesians as acts 19 records much of the city remains underground waiting for archaeologists to uncover it
7707737 the democratic party has woken up to this emerging and critical opportunity
7707738 what i do see with obama is that from his background minority black blah blah blah everything i can relate to that
7707739 because im not rich and im a woman and im a latina and my mom forced me to learn english even though i didnt want to so i could have a better life
7707740 just like electing somebody whos poor like me or had to clean restrooms like me
7707741 i think politicians tend to use us latinos as a card for them to kind of stick out there

7707837 had it been from other than allah then they would find therein many contradictions
7707838 the strange thing is that the asharis differed in many of the attributes like the foot eternalness the face the two hands the two eyes and the speech
7707839 the companions of al ashari differed concerning the attributes of the foot and eternalness are they from the attributes of negation or from the attributes of his essence
7707840 he deserves this attribute of his essence and this is the opinon of alkhaleel bin ahmad and we say the same
7707841 indeed allah is present and everything that is present can be seen

7707852 men think that they achieve their end by the use of the will but the will is not a very great asset unless and until it is fired by feeling feelings of anger indignation curiosity compassion and the like lead men to do things which they would never do merely by the exertion of the will
7707853 you would find it the greatest tonic for the mind and thus for the body the greatest specific against nervous breakdown if you would resolutely keep even a quarter of an hour a day during which you pushed back the tumultuous demands of the things you have to do went into the silence where god can more easily be realised and held in the mind for a moment the thought of the presence of christ and the thought of that quality of his which you need most
7707854 so whatever quality you feel you lack take hold of with both hands by faith and in quietness
7707855 but someone will say i cannot diagnose my own need clearly enough for that i cannot name one thing i supremely need my answer is in that case you must think of jesus jesus very thought of thee with sweetness fills my breast sweetness is a feeling a feeling which will be to the will what steam is to an engine thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee says the old saint and to stay the mind on god means to have so many links with god that the mind can hardly touch any idea without that idea leading to thoughts of god and liberating kindling feelings of love gratitude and adoration

7707874 its not about vocal acrobatics its about being unique and doing things that are identifiable to you
7707875 what makes an artist is when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is
7707876 i didnt work on the first full throttle beyond training gordon baker the special effects animator on full throttle how to use dpaint animator but the biggest difference in the development environment between when i worked on ft2 payback and now is that we had a lot more time for preproduction than we did now seems like publishers really want the developers to hit the road pretty quick which can be a good thing sometimes if youre given too much time sometimes it gives you too much time to second guess your initial decisions which may actually have been correct nowadays you have to make decisions fast so that is where having a lot of experience in game development really pays off plus you are forced to get right into production which is more fun than waiting around
7707877 when we first starting working on the sequel we got a lot of positive feedback from other people inside the company especially the marketing department because we used their conference room a lot to do brain storming and we left the sketches we had done on the marker board for the next day so the marketing people would come in and give us positive feedback of the ideas we left up the day before its always a good idea to get marketing on your side early and this was sort of a serendipitous way of doing just that
7707878 one bummer thing that happened was that one of the big mucky mucks in management was reviewing the game design and said they didnt like it
7707879 the story line we wanted to be similar in them to ft1 so it revolved around a large corporation and the territorial governor concocting a plot to replace all paved highways with hover pads to help make the hover mini vans and family hover cars safer and faster of course this plan didnt sit well with the bikers and truckers who were going to unit to fight this plot at a rally the evil governor had secretly hired the rotwheelers to assassinate father torque the leader of this new alliance at the rally ben is in hiding after being hounded by the media incessantly after he was acquitted of ripburgers murder a charge trumped up by the governor because ripburger was part of their plot so the first half the game ben tries to stop the assassination and the second half he teams up with a persistent undercover female reporter to bring the governor down and uncover his nefarious secret the story would include a bunch of new locations in that area a abandoned power plant a ruin freeway under construction a dam a train a gated community the territorial capital the capitol building a refinery a police station a new motel bar the cave fish colony and grave yard and even a hippie commune i thought it was going to capture the feel of the first game yet expand upon the milieu
7707880 i started work on ft payback in the spring of 2000 and was off the project by november we got as far as detailing out about 25 of the levels and doing about 40 of the preproduction art and we had just started on the 3d character models when it was cancelled
7707881 my opinion is that there existed some major difference of opinion between the team and a particularly influential person who didnt like the direction we were going
7707882 full throttle is one of lucasarts greatest and most beloved original games we cant think of a better brand or character to lead lucasarts charge into a new era of original game development ben so perfectly symbolizes our legacy and yet has just the right mix of attitude and edge to appeal to a new generation of game players
7707883 to be honest i was surprised sean wanted to do ft2 because while working on the dig he didnt seem all that impressed with ft1 a friend of mine always had that impression of his opinion of ft1 so i dont think it was just to me that he expressed his pessimistic view so you can see why i was surprised when he took the job
7707884 we do not want to disappoint the many fans of full throttle and hope everyone can understand how committed we are to delivering the best quality gaming experience that we possibly can
7707885 i dont think any of it was used to be honest i think the new team had a completely different idea and direction they wanted to go in so i dont think any of what we did was in ft hell on wheels i talked to some people who worked on that game but i never got a lot of story details but i didnt really ask i had kind of gotten the whole thing out of my system so i wasnt too interested in the game design details i was more interested how the game went so far down the road to being finished when the plug was pulled i hate wasted time art and effort so i was pretty shocked by that usually publishers release games even if they arent happy with them to try and recoup some of the money they spent on it so i was surprised lucas hadnt done the same
7707886 through the festival we worked intimately with several special record labels production companies artists and fashion designers many on the same business and ideological path as us now that the festival is over we have decided to continue to work with several of these brands further the worm is turning in our business and there are plenty of businesses and artists poised to exploit the new and emerging business model to the fullest we want to be in business with these people we want to be in the fresh daily business
7707887 im excited to be working with a brooklyn based company like brooklyn bodega that has a strong reputation for working with quality hip hop this is the beginning of a new era in hip hop im proud to helm this era alongside a strong team
7707888 this is a new type of deal for a new era in business we are working with fresh daily the brand not just fresh daily the artist artists can no longer base their income on the sale of recorded music same with verizon or apple todays artist has to diversify and expand their revenue streams recorded music touring publishing merchandising licensing these are the ways todays artist will survive record deals are no longer the end game they are an interchangeable part of a larger plan fresh daily gets it and we are about to change the rules to this thing of ours
7707889 i think its something we need to be concerned about
7707890 it would really be rough in early spring and be this dry and not have water knowing that you got the hot growing season ahead of you so it does make a difference being late in the season like this

7708043 they seem each year to start out so young and them by the end of the year we think theyve come so far its fun to watch that happen
7708044 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7708045 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7708046 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7708047 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7708048 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7708049 i said mr president you can say whatever you like bill clinton is a unique figure in our politics
7708050 there may be a few of us who go for mccain but most of us understand we need to kick republicans out of the white house
7708051 want a leader whose judgment and experience they can trust
7708052 the community needs to be the eyes and ears the community needs to observe the community needs to look at suspicious activity the community needs to write down license plates they need to be an integral part of this effort we need them very very desperately we cannot do this alone
7708053 their safety is paramount that its vital its important its job one the residents of oakland deserve better than to be victimized by acts of violence and robbery that tear at the very fabric of our community
7708054 people should be able to move throughout the day going about their lives with a sense of peace and security
7708055 so we cannot and will not allow fear to overtake our community
7708056 we do take these crimes very very seriously we have been working on them around the clock for a number of weeks
7708057 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes

7708065 this is a far reaching program designed to comprehensively restructure and reposition the business for years to come
7708066 we wanted to make a major change today across the company in order to accelerate our building of a strong and dynamic integrated media business
7708067 however the content creation and selection will remain under the control of their editors
7708068 as a result of this program a number of positions will likely be declared redundant
7708069 there will also be a wide range of initiatives to significantly reduce costs in all departments across the business including deferral of wage reviews for senior management
7708070 there will be criticism from some inside and outside the company that these changes particularly in editorial will compromise quality and critical mass in the metro mastheads and their mission we reject that
7708071 this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our newspapers will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality and excellence
7708072 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7708073 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago

7708090 coupled with an earlier tournament we had we have close to 125 000 toward a 140 000 vehicle
7708091 a lot of people play in a lot of tournaments because theyre generous
7708092 and people were able to meet people they ordinarily wouldnt meet
7708093 i was able to spend some time with influential people at both schools in a relaxed atmosphere
7708094 were also working with ud for a way to do something with coaches vs cancer maybe a tip off breakfast or something
7708095 morris furniture supports both programs and i want to be a part of what this benefits

7708098 youre not just going to a swim meet the olympics are a cultural event and so much more
7708099 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7708100 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7708101 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7708102 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you youre always losing in the final its so great that you finally win something big
7708103 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games

7708109 we are all very excited about signing to sensory records
7708110 the high caliber musicians on this label have inspired our band to become what it is and we are now proud to be a part of their family
7708111 the first thing is for sparc to do a review for government on how the actual targeting of the high performance and most likely medal winning sports actually went and then have a look at whats a realistic budget
7708112 i dont have a feeling for how much more but what i know is that to do well at the olympics you cant just be the gifted amateur
7708113 you do need that total focus you do need all the support that we can wrap around our athletes
7708114 we can never be totally happy the world is moving on in terms of performance and if we stay still we will get further behind so what that means is that in our review which will take place when we get back we have to look for another edge
7708115 absolutely of course people are hurting because of change in the economy but i think this is an appropriate spend
7708116 its not just about medals its about encouraging participation that leads to better health and tackling obesity
7708117 its an emotionally stressful job but its important we keep working with people like this
7708118 she didnt qualify for access to a safe house because the abuser was not in nelson because she was not from here she didnt understand the incredible difficulty in getting affordable rental accommodation
7708119 she was about to give birth it was a very high stress situation
7708120 its a good way to touch someones life it doesnt take a lot of effort
7708121 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7708122 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7708123 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not because that would be speculation
7708124 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
7708125 i will tell you having visited israel a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7708126 they recognise that there are no good military options but they also recognize that it is from their perspective it is unacceptable for iran to have a nuclear weapon
7708127 we can no longer ignore the effect television has over our childrens food choices
7708128 no one suffered any significant injuries in this accident but this accident could have been much more serious
7708129 its nice to come here where ive got some good memories and where i grew up
7708130 now ive just got to find a way to help the team
7708131 youd be lying if you say you dont ever look back at the different decisions youve made but at each point in my life i made the decision that i thought was right and that i was comfortable with
7708132 ive had a great run and ive had a fun time
7708133 he might play well have to see how much he can pick up in the next couple days
7708134 were going to simplify the plays for him if nothing else hes going to have to be ready in case something happens to dan
7708135 we like his instincts and his ability to run a team he also puts a lot of pressure on the ball
7708136 signing niko just made me lock in and focus a little more coming into camp
7708137 i think you spur everybody on by signing people that can play
7708138 we know that niko is a good linebacker hes good on special teams nate had his best offseason program that hes had
7708139 he said it was going to be a fair battle and may the best man win clearly thats what he said and thats what hes done
7708140 im not happy but the coaches said theyre going to play the best 11 guys on defense
7708141 whatever they ask from me ive got to do each week youve got to prepare to be the starter anyway so thats how youve got to go with it
7708142 nate was a starter how many years here so he probably felt not disrespected but motivated thatll motivate somebody
7708143 this was the first u s open it was a very good time for something positive to happen in the sports world
7708144 i still get a thrill to be around rod laver and champions of the past and billie jean i idolised them when i was growing up
7708145 this one is very special and also a special year to win in 68
7708146 it was nice to finally make it legal so we could go play
7708147 youd play seven months of the year and go home and youd made 5 000
7708148 i would think that both of them have gotten to the point where we feel confident we can win with both of them
7708149 ive got four tailbacks there we may start two at one time
7708150 i know its important who takes the first snap to a lot of people but for us its more important to play the guys we feel we can win with
7708151 this is all new now but i feel a lot more comfortable now than i did last year
7708152 weve been putting the offense in and i cant wait to finally put it on the field and see what we can do
7708153 theres five or six on offense weve got eight nine maybe 10 true freshmen that will play for the first time this weekend thats why im a little nervous but im also excited for them
7708154 we feel well be ready for an up tempo pace
7708155 theyre solid theres really no weak spots and theyre a veteran team
7708156 its not like were opening up against somebody we can mess around and play awful and win

7708234 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
7708235 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk

7708238 i know there are always reports out there in the press and im not sure i saw exactly what prime minister maliki said but clearly from our perspective weve been working with the iraqi government for a long time on this agreement were discussing goals as you know youve heard us speak about different kinds of timelines or aspirational goals that may be acceptable i dont have anything to announce on that an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad wed like to let them continue and to continue to show progress what were focused on is getting a good agreement not getting an agreement by a particular date so well continue those discussions
7708239 out of the more than 151 000 families who had fled their houses in baghdad just 7 112 had returned to them by mid july according to the iraqi ministry of migration

7708370 personal agendas are subordinate to whatever your candidate wants you to do
7708371 even if we are not as enthusiastic as others are about obama we are not voting for john mccain
7708372 who do you want to answer the phone at 3 a m
7708373 as long as clinton was a viable candidate in the democratic nomination process many of our members felt a passionate need to return the loyalty she has earned over decades of support
7708374 i saw on the website about jason castro and his family i was a really big fan of him while he was on the show and often read the message boards one day i logged into idf and noticed that i had a pm from one of the other posters on the jason castro forum

7708380 ja meneer de aanvraag ligt nog bij t mobile daar is het wachten op
7708381 people are realizing that economic independence is probably more important than political independence
7708382 nobody was realizing that before india can choke us anytime no matter what the situation is tomorrow the first they will do is stop the supply into kashmir
7708383 trade between srinagar and muzaffarabad is part of confidence building measures between india and pakistan that has time and again been talked about by mainstream political parties
7708384 unfortunately new delhi has not responded as a result the separatists have jumped on the same bandwagon that is when the fruit growers and everybody else said hang on if the rest of indias market is closed to us then we will start heading the other way
7708385 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7708386 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7708387 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7708388 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7708389 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7708390 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7708391 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7708392 were always looking for competition at positions and that group has had as much competition as the quarterbacks if not more so
7708393 theres a lot of quality depth there which is important for us particularly early in the season
7708394 this offense gets you in open space a lot and thats where i like to be it puts you in position to show your athleticism and ability
7708395 theyre definitely a way to prepare for what well see in the big 12
7708396 when you know youve got guys like bradley and cyrus behind you theyre both home run hitters
7708397 you travel in numbers it usually means youll get caught easier
7708398 were still requesting the eyes and ears of the community
7708399 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7708400 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7708401 i cant comment on went wrong at this time if anything went wrong at all
7708402 the escapees are more of a threat right now than how they did it or how they got up to the roof
7708403 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7708404 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7708405 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7708406 together we have known success and seen setbacks but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world
7708407 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the senate
7708408 i am here tonight to pay tribute to two men who have changed my life and the life of this country barack obama and edward m kennedy
7708409 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7708410 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7708411 are you tired of that subprime leadership in the white house
7708412 you practice it in front of them so they get a sense of it
7708413 unlike the senator from arizona my family doesnt have a private jet
7708414 by the time we got to washington we had an ethics reform plan in place
7708415 barack obama has already started and hell finish the job as president of the united states

7708417 presenting an exciting mix of contemporary and new plays in historic downtown lowell
7708418 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7708419 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7708420 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7708421 the internet has become an increasingly significant source of political news for consumers especially during this latest battle for the white house
7708422 just as cnn com is where people go to find out whats happening in their world their communities and their lives cnnpolitics com is where people go online to find out whats happening in politics
7708423 the ratings success cnn is enjoying on television this election cycle is bolstered by the incredible traffic generated through cnnpolitics com
7708424 were proud to be the news organization people turn to for the latest political news whether its on television laptops or mobile phones
7708425 were cautiously confident about the fact that we have been able to make a step that is lifting the bans and thats not an easy thing for us to do
7708426 getting that number of bans in place was a huge logistical exercise and therefore it means a lot to actually lift them however weve had enough of an indication that government is serious about negotiating with us
7708427 it really depends on what the total package is at the end of the day before we take anything back to our members
7708428 if the negotiations break down i dont think wed have any choice but to return to industrial action and i dont think were talking about work bans
7708429 i think wed look at something more serious but i hasten to add im reasonably confident that we wont get to that point and we will get an outcome that is satisfactory to members
7708430 there is a limited stock of people with the knowledge and expertise
7708431 you also have to factor in that people do take leave from time to time and the nature of our work is that you dont know when you will be getting work in
7708432 we had two to three planing schemes to deal with the past year and the hearings for those can be quite complicated and decisions can take a long time
7708433 sometimes they take longer than we like and we seek extensions from time to time we also try to accommodate lawyers and planners for the councils with our hearing dates
7708434 the decision by mr knowles a well known greens activist to appeal the meander valley councils approval of the pipeline would seem to be based on ideology rather than science and the facts
7708435 the greens and their allies need to accept that they were wrong in their campaign to oppose the meander dam and they are wrong to support an attempt to delay pipelines from the meander dam that could significantly benefit the agricultural production in the area
7708436 there has been a significant delay to the project it was originally hoped tenders would be lodged by september 1
7708437 this is an increase of 12 6 well above the rate of both general and health inflation and ensures tasmanians with mental health needs will have access to essential clinical support
7708438 funding has been provided to ensure the sustainability of current services with almost 2 2 million added to the funding base and a further 3 6 million in full salary indexation
7708439 in addition more than 1 6 million has been provided as part year funding for four new clinical directors and a major new training program
7708440 there will be one new clinical director in each region as well as a statewide position to continue the reform process together with an increased emphasis on quality and safety through a new clinical governance model
7708441 a new director of training and a revitalised training program will ensure all staff maintain the high level of skill and knowledge needed to provide contemporary professional mental health services
7708442 the budget also will need to stretch to cover increasing usage of existing services such as the wilfred lopes centre for which we an additional 1 5 million has been provided
7708443 this is a very positive move and i agree with the stakeholders that this is the next move
7708444 if such an authority is set up it would decide what inquiries and studies are necessary

7708447 they agreed to embark on a political partnership with two staggering goals revolutionize the democratic party and at the same time capture the presidency for bill
7708448 a majority of americans expected hillary to stay within the boundaries of the traditional role of first lady and not meddle in the official business of the country that would not be possible
7708449 i dont give any excuse for the tni to be back to the political stage in indonesia
7708450 no vamos a hacer desfilar a las monjas en traje de ba o
7708451 pero ser fea no es un requisito para convertirse en monja la belleza externa es un regalo de dios y no debemos ocultarlo
7708452 las monjas est n un poco excluidas est n un poco marginadas en la vida eclesi stica
7708453 esta ser una ocasi n para hacer que su contribuci n sea m s visible
7708454 votar por la monja a la que consideren una modelo
7708455 es una iniciativa que resta importancia al papel de las monjas quienes se han entregado a dios
7708456 the neck medallion zipper pull can detach posing a choking hazard to young children
7708457 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7708458 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7708459 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7708460 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7708461 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7708462 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7708463 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7708464 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7708465 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7708466 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7708467 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7708468 miramax is the only studio thats ever told us to add
7708469 can i ask what sort of advice and help you are providing
7708470 ambassador khalilzad had planned to meet socially with zardari during his personal vacation
7708471 but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed the meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari himself
7708472 why do i have to learn about this from asif after its all set up
7708473 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the details we are merely keeping in touch with the parties can i say that honestly if youre providing advice and help please advise and help me so that i understand whats going on here
7708474 finally finally russia has acknowledged that we exist and that we have suffered
7708475 i think after russia we will be recognized by for example belgrade for example china and maybe syria and also belarus
7708476 everything saakashvili does is organized by your country and every child here knows this

7708485 our competition has built a nice product but the nice things that people write about their product is that its well priced
7708486 its pretty discernible certainly desktop standalone graphics theyve seen improvement there

7708493 lynn richardson real estate manager for meijer said the company is the midst of changing to the newest design so about half of the eight new stores opening this year are the larger footprint and half will be smaller all of the stores starting construction in 2009 will be the smaller size including plainfield
7708494 i think theyre all pretty bad i think fox is the best probably because they have an idea of what theyre doing because they have an editorial perspective theyre able to focus it more so its more cohesive it makes more sense
7708495 the 41 year old female grocery shopper in your household
7708496 even when i am old and gray do not forsake me o god till i declare your power to the next generation your might to all who are to come
7708497 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate when we begin the great fight
7708498 will have no stronger partner in the united states senate
7708499 est claramente demostrado que cuando se trata de apoyar a barack obama se al las celebridades que lo respaldan no entienden de l mites en cuanto a campa as difamatorias o ataques
7708500 ive tried to not have long discussion about short lists long lists
7708501 but ive said publicly before and i will repeat again that sen clinton would have been on anybodys short list and i took her very seriously
7708502 i answered a brief question thats all youre going to get
7708503 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell
7708504 i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
7708505 you know im very proud of cindys father he was a guy that barely got out of high school fought in w w ii in the army air corps came home and made a business and made the american dream
7708506 and so somehow youve had cindy on this show and the fact is that shes extremely generous
7708507 she goes around the world doing humanitarian stuff shes in now in georgia as we speak looking at the humanitarian aspects of the results of this russian invasion so im proud of my life and my record and we spend our time in a condominium in washington in a condominium in phoenix sometime over here in the state of california and we have a place up in northern arizona and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to with houses what it has to do with putting americans in houses and keeping in their homes and thats what im gong to do
7708508 overall it will feel very even it will have an easier approach not so much glare
7708509 nowadays you catch a lot of glare we break it down and have good glare control
7708510 to give you an idea we can reduce energy consumption at each street lamp by about 25 to 30 percent immediately thats just one to one comparison
7708511 we also have the energy savings because of the control systems you can turn it on turn it off dim it down as the ambient lighting increases or decreases
7708512 if you ask the city theyre probably changing out some light somewhere every day that will go away
7708513 so now you have labor savings and the cost of fuel driving around finding all these broken lights that is a significant saving and i believe that is if not larger than the energy savings its equal to it
7708514 the same thing weve been hearing from hillary clinton for the past couple of months which is that she supports senator obama as we all do
7708515 we are going to move forward united to change the team thats in the white house
7708516 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7708517 john mccain has a compelling biography he served america with bravery and distinction and he deserves a respect for that but his policies dont deserve respect
7708518 his ideas dont deserve respect because theyre the same old ideas that weve seen out of george bush for the last eight years
7708519 weve sort of made a decision not to buy any cold meats for the time being
7708520 canadian consumers should be assured that canadas meat supply is recognized amongst the safest in the world
7708521 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7708522 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7708523 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7708524 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7708525 for if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth there no
7708526 tonight claire mccaskill will address the very liberal delegates of the democrat national convention she will no doubt fail at achieving the impossible convincing missourians and americans that the obama biden ticket understands their needs and the challenges our country faces it is no wonder claire asserted that the low performance of the vacationing democrat controlled congress it is not as bad as it seems shes more worried about taking her kids to see kanye west 1 than addressing issues that impact americans lives claire and kanye have a great deal in common kanye claimed that george bush doesnt care about black people and claire thinks george bush let people die on rooftops in new orleans because they were poor and because they were black disappointing ridiculous and hurtful rhetoric that divides rather than brings people together
7708527 i saw people putting leftover parts on coal fired stoves to melt down the waste to get to the gold
7708528 itd produce a reddish smoke that was so strong i couldnt stand there for more than a couple minutes before my eyes would just burn
7708529 we are faced with the ugly truth that the basel convention has been unable to accomplish even the prerequisite steps of addressing the inequities and exploitation made possible by globalization
7708530 a lot of people may think electronic manufacturing is a clean industry but its not
7708531 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
7708532 una vez se ha nominado por el partido y luego del proceso de primaria la candidatura le pertenece al candidato el partido es impotente a sacarlo a no ser de que tenga una base en el reglamento para expulsarlo y no veo una base para llegar a esos extremos
7708533 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7708534 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7708535 new from the bbc a magnificent new magazine to inform and inspire
7708536 i like your card rich russians dont get the metal one just a plastic centurion
7708537 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7708538 the woman who had dominated discussions for so long could no longer lead debates or keep up with the thread of a drinks party conversation
7708539 on bad days she could hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7708540 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7708541 losing dad was truly awful for mum not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7708542 that was plenty of fuel to get us all the way to california right down to the water
7708543 we did this to demonstrate that biodiesel is a viable fuel thats easy to use and it works and its reliable
7708544 there were probably about 50 in coolest things we saw
7708545 if you had told me two months ago that wed be dead even heading into the democratic national convention i would have told you were crazy
7708546 senator mccain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign
7708547 i will bring a lifetime of experience and sen obama will bring a speech he gave in 2002
7708548 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7708549 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7708550 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its okay really
7708551 one of his most famous songs i know youre very familiar with gasolina
7708552 the center of gustav will be moving near or over haiti on tuesday gustav could become a hurricane prior to moving over the land
7708553 no i dont when obama came to detroit the mayor didnt go to the rally because he thought he would be a distraction the same applies here this event is all about obama
7708554 thats not something that divides us it brings us together
7708555 out of that class period our goal is to get them in 30 minutes of non stop cardio aerobic activity and while theyre doing that by the means of these bikes treadmills and ellipticals were going to be teaching mini lessons so that they understand the whys of what theyre doing and how theyre doing it and how important it is and how they can take this information home to their families and the communities as well
7708556 some kids are in very good shape and some kids just rather play video games and watch tv
7708557 the kids that are in the magnet program are going to actually fitness test their siblings and their family members and together theyre going to set a goal and write goals that they want to achieve and were going to monitor that and hold them accountable to that
7708558 the new rule will obviously improve the long term investment environment it will stop listed companies from raising funds insatiably from the market while not properly rewarding shareholders
7708559 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7708560 there was a national survey done that showed that over 40 percent of students felt comfortable bending the rules to get ahead in business and we know thats just not appropriate at all
7708561 we talk about shoplifting we talk about employees losing their jobs for doing things that are not right well go through cases and explain heres where people made mistakes
7708562 it made me realize that there may be times when the benefits from a career may oppose the beliefs that i follow but it is my responsibility to work for a company and do the type of work that matches my principles
7708563 students really do listen if not everybody if some students get the point across they can make a huge difference
7708564 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7708565 until people get sick they dont usually know its there
7708566 we think its the most underdiagnosed disease in the country
7708567 about 150 000 can expect to get sick some very much so
7708568 most people maintain just the right amount of iron in their bodies
7708569 it takes a while for even an astute physician to detect
7708570 its interesting how different the presentation is from patient to patient its such a jumble and thats what puts a burden on the general practitioner
7708571 were tying to get an iron test put in there so we can get at iron loading
7708572 ninety percent of the iron absorbed will go to the liver
7708573 if a person comes in and cant open their fist thats referred to as iron fist
7708574 heres a person who was able to tuck away the iron without it causing destruction of the organs
7708575 and yet there are other people who cant handle it
7708576 when you take blood out of the body iron stored in body tissue is used to make new blood
7708577 most people only are allowed to give blood once every seven weeks
7708578 i ask each and every one of you to work has hard for barack and joe biden as you did for me
7708579 the intense atmosphere of sad loneliness caused by his schuberts delicate state of health and his sentimental and professional disappointments
7708580 it is an interior journey that the celebrated austrian composer wrote in 1827 just one year before his premature death at the age of 31
7708581 when schubert brings a poetic text into his universe of sound he performs it through a melodic link that penetrates the soul with sweetness bringing the listener to feel his same nostalgic consummation the same call of that truth of the heart that goes beyond all rationality in this way a picture is born that speaks of genuine everyday life of nostalgia of introspection and of the future
7708582 the spontaneous and exuberant young schubert was successful in communicating to us here tonight as well what he lived and experienced he is worthy therefore of the universal acclaim that is given to this illustrious genius of music who honors european civilization and the great culture and spirituality of christian and catholic austria
7708583 ik heb een aantal jaren moeten lever zonder tafel zonder stoel
7708584 de muziekwereld niet echt meer heeft gevolgd sinds zijn vliegtuig onderschept werd in 1968
7708585 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7708586 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7708587 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7708588 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7708589 if the auto industry is doing bad everyone is doing bad its like everythings on hold
7708590 at first it was supposed to start last april then it was supposed to start in august now its supposed to be starting in october they keep on pushing it back so until i see it
7708591 we have a strong feeling that he suffered from endogenous depression which is quite common among men in the 40 50 age group that he was the only surviving male in the family whose other male members had met unnatural deaths weighed heavily on his mind
7708592 he worked with us for one and a half months before quitting on friday last along with him five others also quit and they too had to join bmc they pressurised me for the relieving letter but manjunath never spoke of it anyway there were no hurdles in relieving him
7708593 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

7708616 while californias residents are fortunate to have state laws that provide some protection against hate crimes and school bullying this pattern of violence against gay lesbian bisexual and transgender students is repeated too often in schools and communities across america each day this tragedy illustrates the need to pass a federal hate crimes law to ensure everyone is protected against violent bias motivated crimes wherever they reside
7708617 coming out young is okay but expressing your sexuality can be hazardous to your health
7708618 i went and told a teacher and he said well maybe if you didnt act like one he wouldnt call you one that was the first time it hit me you just wouldnt expect that to come from a teacher
7708619 i think ive dealt with it so much my whole life that it really doesnt bother me anymore not as it used to if you have a birthmark on your leg for so long you dont even notice it i tell my friends all the time im like what makes them think talking about me is going to make me change who i am they can talk about me they can do anything but im still saro
7708620 the school does not tolerate bullying for any reason its more than having a policy and enforcing it its establishing an environment of tolerance of everyone being gay here doesnt set you apart youre just another kid with something about you that is unique
7708621 you know what we are all equal now they cant bring me down anymore
7708622 gay it too loaded homosexual is too modern so you have to speak in terms of their relationship to one another
7708623 europeans have claimed the non african creation of egypt in order to downgrade the position of african people in world history they have laid the foundation of what they call western civilization on a structure that the western mind did not create
7708624 the artists adapted the visual language relevant to emotional and perhaps sometimes sexual intimacy to express an extremely rare fraternal circumstance
7708625 its great to review the pearl knowledge constantly and catch up the new technology to indentify shecy pearl quality factor these make me more confident in my area than before
7708626 base on the pearl grade system we upgraded our process control which can let shecypearl reach a higher level of quality control and let shecy running more effectively at the same time
7708627 we are working hard people and would not stop going forward
7708628 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7708629 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7708630 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7708631 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7708632 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7708633 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7708634 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7708635 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7708636 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7708637 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7708638 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7708639 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7708640 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads

7708653 it has been just over a year since a citizens group participated in an intensive public collaboration effort related to specificlements of the colville forest plan revision
7708654 now that we are further along in the wilderness evaluation process im looking forward to having more detailed public discussion this will help further inform my decision on whether to recommend additional wilderness or not in the revised forest plan
7708655 the collaborative workshops will be open to all members of the public not just to those individuals who participated in the previous effort to honor past collaborative public discussions on wilderness well be incorporating information gained from the 2007 collaborative round up in this process
7708656 each community workshop will evaluate a specific set of iras within each geographic area we encourage people within and outside of these communities to participate in this collaborative process
7708657 computers like cats can operate crossdimensionally the trick is in getting them to do what you want
7708658 greece does not have folk music and it does not have folklore
7708659 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
7708660 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
7708661 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7708662 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7708668 the nonsense screeds you compose and post to usenet lack any kind of coherent and rational meaning whatsoever and are composed of random bits and pieces stolen from mythology science fiction religion comic books etc placed into a blender and the switch turned to the highest setting about every other screed has droppings of death threats racial bigotry laughably false prophesies of gloom and doom and inane attempts to extort money these bland meaningless pulpy messes are then trowled into usenet identical or nearly identical screeds are repeated ad nauseum

7708680 you are the god damned ignorant liar here now that is not me taking the lords name in vain
7708681 laws count the us constitution count more and we need to have judges on the bench who are going to carry out those laws not make law or interpret law

7708696 the trip gives us an opportunity to move forward both here in the u s government and also with our counterparts in europe who want to support georgias economic and military reconstruction
7708697 developments lately in georgia have increased the importance of this visit
7708698 to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7708699 cheney certainly has had a tougher view on russia than some others in the administration
7708700 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
7708701 russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7708702 someone who made 4 2 million last year and lives in a mansion that a mobster helped pay for should not be throwing stones when mr obamas flesh and blood lives in squalor raising the standard of living of his opponents extended family is probably not a smart idea
7708703 ill take it out and put it in the field when i take out the trash

7708719 whats the point of a revolution if you cant shoot anyone
7708720 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7708721 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7708722 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not because that would be speculation
7708723 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
7708724 i will tell you having visited israel a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7708725 they recognise that there are no good military options but they also recognize that it is from their perspective it is unacceptable for iran to have a nuclear weapon
7708726 these intense rains may produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides
7708727 we are all called to a newer country and a better world

7708729 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7708730 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7708731 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7708732 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7708733 the elite camp was great there were a lot of great players there and alumni the coaches were great and they taught me a lot when i was down there the decision was basically i loved indiana so much that i didnt think i needed to see anything else
7708734 my dad was always a fan of bobby knight and so was i when he was at indiana ive continued to stay a fan of indiana since then
7708735 i had been there when i was in 4th grade my brother and i got in there and were just shooting buckets we thought it was the coolest thing at that age just to go shoot at assembly hall one of the players actually let us because they were about to practice so he let us in there and we just got up a few shots it was in the dark but it was still cool to go look up at the banners its just an amazing place
7708736 i had known coach crean when he was at marquette i met him last summer and he just treated me and my family really well when we were down there when he got the job at indiana i was really excited because i had been a fan of indiana hes such a determined coach and i really like that about him i think he has a great ability to get players to the next level
7708737 your pain doesnt define who you are his word defines you
7708738 it was really cold that day in the mountains and i got frosbite on my balls
7708739 lick my thumb and wipe the smudge of something of ones face
7708740 jakarta 6 comes through default of naming the file it took me six times before i got what i wanted the video still needs some editing the running time for the video is just over 39 minutes
7708741 hussain is well educated after completing his bsc he studied at the indian institute of mass communication in delhi he was editor of simis magazine islamic movement
7708742 thats the area we really felt led to go to
7708743 its a very dramatic move but i believe god is in it
7708744 were not just a bunch of uneducated yahoos looking for something to do were counting the cost
7708745 thats the strange thing about it nobody was forced one by one they committed themselves to going to california
7708746 hes a very sound young man its not like hes being led in the wrong direction he knows how to persevere
7708747 when youre rooted and grounded in gods word god will provide and take care of their needs
7708748 right now theyre acting on faith i understand that part of them my prayers go with them
7708749 i have bittersweet feelings about it but its something were deeply committed to
7708750 they seem to want to hear what we have to say theyve been very open
7708751 we played hard and the kids hung in there together it hasnt changed a darn thing though and hopefully the kids will buy into that attitude last week doesnt matter were going to go into every week expecting to win
7708752 were looking at film were going to work on things like staying on blocks penalties and trying to eliminate those were doing a better job on pass drops on defense
7708753 more importantly they won with the right attitude and effort if we can increase that then were headed in the right direction
7708754 i see us headed in the right direction i see the attitude and that were getting better but that can change in a heartbeat we keep reinforcing things that we coach all along weve got to be on the kids constantly and make sure they do what theyre coached to do we stay on them and keep making them work we want to make sure theyre focused on the task at hand
7708755 our guys have to stay on assignments and then they have to tackle
7708756 were more than capable and hopefully the kids are up to the challenge
7708757 but weve got to improve on that we need to make sure pass drops are better we did well against the run but weve got to improve against the passing game

7708761 not enough young people actually get out to vote because they dont think their voice is heard
7708762 not only for the presidents race but our local races that will be a lot tighter and less people voting in those races so i mean every vote counts
7708763 im busy with school right now i just havent made that a priority
7708764 we will have our work cut out for us but i think we can do it
7708765 probably games and fun things to do for younger kids to come out and get registered to vote and also have a drink with their friends and sit down and eat with their friends
7708766 he should be willing to join me in a series of public debates and focus on these very difficult issues we face as a country
7708767 we were disappointed that senator roberts didnt believe he could work that in
7708768 my job is to show up and do the very best job i can to get an energy bill passed
7708769 if were in session i have to be back working for the people of kansas
7708770 the people of kansas worry more about passing an energy bill than they do listening to a debate
7708771 over four years of working together eating sandwiches and listening to speeches on the senate floor i learned why barack is such a fierce advocate for women and their children in his own life he saw women struggle and sacrifice to support his family
7708772 smart tough women sacrificed to make barack the man he is today and hes never forgotten it
7708773 i lacked the most important one of all i wasnt barack obama
7708774 you see barack obama doesnt want us to rise above politics he simply knows that with the right kind of politics we can all rise up
7708775 now hes going to be the next president of the united states of america
7708776 his story is our story your story my story its the american story
7708777 when obama came to the state senate i was the senate minority leader and he said to me you know i like to work hard
7708778 some people say i was doing him a favor those people did not understand that ethics reform means getting officials to limit gifts to themselves

7708782 when the government gives a woman the opportunity to make her own decision about abortion she generally does a good job of figuring out if she is in a position to raise the baby well
7708783 it is tempting to think so just as it is tempting to think that a truckload of childrens books will make a child smarter
7708784 the risks that scare people and the risks that kill people are very different
7708785 most innovations in the field of child safety are affiliated with shock of shocks a new product to be marketed
7708786 to the number of lives saved by far noisier crusades child resistant packaging and estimated fifty lives a year flame retardant pajamas ten lives keeping children away from airbags in cars fewer than five young children a year have been killed by airbags since their introduction and safely drawstrings on childrens clothing two lives
7708787 what does it matter if parents are manipulated by experts and marketers if it makes even one child safer
7708788 conventional wisdom is often shoddily formed and devilishly difficult to to see through but it can be done
7708789 the answers may seem odd but after the fact also rather obvious
7708790 it means that the u s can do to anyone what they did to maher
7708791 they can do it to anyone to any foreign citizen and use the immigration process as a guise basically to send someone to be tortured
7708792 whether omar khadr killed anyone under what circumstances and for what purpose are precisely the issues to be determined in a court of law
7708793 the eyewitnesss testimony needs to be presented in court with an opportunity for the defence to cross examine and to present other evidence
7708794 i am keenly aware of my own ignorance of the facts of the case which is why i would like to see omar khadr tried in a legitimate canadian court
7708795 nor does it matter who or what khadrs father was he is beyond the reach of any court and it doesnt matter what his mother sister or brother think

7709011 barack obama will announce hes running for the state senate seat occupied by alice palmer whos running for reynolds u
7709012 an early organizing meeting for your state senate campaign was held at his ayers house and your campaign has said you are
7709013 sam ackerman a chicago political activist and neighbour of ayers said the whole thing is preposterous
7709014 sol stern a contributing editor of chicagos city journal has observed that while ayers today is widely regarded as a member in good standing of the citys civic establishment not an unrepentant domestic terrorist the impression of ayerss good citizenship is incorrect
7709015 there are a lot of reasons that americans are angry about washington politics and one more example is the way senator obamas opponents are playing guilt by association tarring him because he happens to know bill ayers i also know bill ayers he worked with me in shaping our now nationally renowned school reform program he is a nationally recognized distinguished professor of education at the university of illinois chicago and a valued member of the chicago community i dont condone what he did 40 years ago but i remember that period well it was a difficult time but those days are long over i believe we have too many challenges in chicago and our country to keep re fighting 40 year old battles
7709016 confession time i too have eaten dinner at bill ayerss house more than once and have served with him on a committee and he was one of those who recruited my wife and me at a reception when we were considering positions at the university of illinois chicago moreover i have had bill and his wife bernardine dohrn to my apartment was a guest lecturer in a course he taught and joined in a successful effort to persuade him to stay at uic and say no to an offer from harvard of course im not running for anything but i do write for the new york times and who knows this association with former fugitive members of the weathermen might be enough in the eyes of some to get me canned did i conspire with bill ayers did i help him build bombs did i aid and abet his evasion for a time of justice not likely given that at the time of the events that brought ayers and dohrn to public attention i was a supporter of the vietnam war i havent asked him to absolve me of that sin of which i have since repented and he hasnt asked me to forgive him for his if he has any indeed in all the time i spent with ayers and dohrn politics present or past never came up
7709017 its kind of laughable for people who have worked with bernadine and bill in the most boring and mundane settings and recognize that theyre absolutely upstanding establishment citizens today said lawrence c

7709060 t he use of arable and meadowlands was under the supervision and direction of the community
7709061 just as the share of each member in so much of the mark as was distributed was of equal size so was his share also in the use of the common mark the nature of this use was determined by the members of the community as a whole

7709063 w hat existed in fact was not a tragedy of the commons but rather a triumph that for hundreds of years and perhaps thousands although written records do not exist to prove the longer era land was managed successfully by communities
7709064 it is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons as a rational being each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain
7709065 we must admit that our legal system of private property plus inheritance is unjust but we put up with it because we are not convinced at the moment that anyone has invented a better system the alternative of the commons is too horrifying to contemplate injustice is preferable to total ruin

7709138 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7709139 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat

7709156 the government played no role in this litigation until filing an amicus brief ordered by the court
7709157 because we conclude that the united states is not a party to this action for the purposes of fed r app p 4 a 1 a and b we further conclude that eisensteins notice of appeal was untimely
7709158 in our view the united states is not a party for these purposes to a qui tam action when the government fails to intervene or to raise or resist any legal claim
7709159 the word party refers to the person participating in the proceedings with control over the litigation

7709170 it wouldnt help us to bring in somebody with a big debtor practice because were not going to have such a practice

7709174 theres less of a stigma about medications less community reaction

7709176 you just want to know what theyre taking if theyre taking high blood pressure medication and theyre going to get to a high stress level in the trial you want to know

7709178 she wasnt interacting with other jurors in the hallway she had a flat affect
7709179 to tell you the truth im going through menopause and taking antidepressants
7709180 im concerned if someone is taking antipsychotic medication if theyre taking high blood pressure thats none of my business
7709181 i think lawyers have a right to know anything that could conceivably affect their clients cases
7709182 im comfortable with a juror saying in general im on medication
7709183 sunwolf a santa clara calif jury consultant who lectures and has written books on jury selection advises lawyers to ask all jurors on questionnaires whether they are taking any medications
7709184 what is a jurors job it is to pay attention and be able to retain information and follow jury deliberations peoples competency is impaired by the drug theyre taking lawyers can demonstrate a challenge for cause as a result
7709185 were inundated with the commercialization of drugs without knowing the side effects
7709186 as a trial lawyer i would love to have the information the reality is there are people walking around on very serious medicine it might interfere with their perception and judgment and ability to stay awake but how far do you want to go down that road
7709187 ive never had a judge allow me to randomly ask about taking medications unless it directly relates to attention deficit
7709188 usually if you ask such a question the other side objects you piss off the judge and it makes you look horrible
7709189 no ones going to raise their hand and admit what drugs they are taking
7709190 the risk is to make someone not feel that they are on the spot
7709191 this court harbors no ill will towards nor any desire to aid any party to this action
7709192 anthony didnt do anything that he was not instructed to do by his superiors whatever he did he did with their full knowledge and consent dipping into company accounts was a common practice among attorneys there is the galasso firm going to say they never went to a concert or a sporting event using this money i think thats something that should be addressed
7709193 replete with tales of alleged ethical violations and questionable practices
7709194 nowhere directly states let alone provides supporting detail that any other person participated in the actual theft of any client funds which formed a principal part of the criminal case liotti was defending at the time he made his statements to the press
7709195 accordingly anthonys affidavits to the extent they are offered to support what mr liotti said about plaintiffs complicity in the theft of client funds is contradicted by his own sworn testimony before judge peck and thus is insufficient to change the result of the prior motions
7709196 i simply raised a question which is did anthony act alone or did he have help
7709197 this is the job of a criminal defense attorney to raise reasonable doubt
7709198 i n the instant case the plaintiffs were not public figures and there is little more than unfounded speculation as opposed to evidence that the plaintiffs affirmatively sought out media attention for themselves such as that they might be considered limited purpose public figures
7709199 at the time i made the allegedly defamatory statement i believed it to be true based on my conversations with anthony and my independent case investigation
7709200 additionally anthony still steadfastly maintains that the firm and its partners engaged in illegal and unsavory practices
7709201 the only proof advanced in support of defendants claim that he did not know that what he was saying was false are anthonys affidavits in which anthony avers that he did tell liotti as his attorney that the plaintiffs were involved
7709202 already been sullied by media accounts other than the defendants statement is submitted
7709203 i got conned by someone who i thought was a client

7709206 its a reputable company but i suspect there is no connection between tah tong and the people who are involved in the scam
7709207 since he was the one who instructed us what to do i can only assume he was part of the scam

7709290 works of saint augustine a translation for the 21st century
7709291 this volume contains three of augustines works that show him responding to a large variety of questions posed by different persons the miscellany of eighty three questions was compiled over the course of several years and deals with philosophical theological and exegetical matters that had been raised in the religious community that augustine founded and headed some of these matters are handled very briefly some at great length augustines exegesis is particularly interesting the miscellany of questions in response to simplician was written at the request of the saintly bishop of milan who followed ambrose in that role this work in the form of two books is crucially important for understanding augustines theology of grace and how he arrived at his position on this issue which is certainly his most important contribution to western theology but the questions are not limited to a discussion of grace finally the eight questions of dulcitius includes responses to questions in which uniquely augustine quotes himself at length

7709351 all that the leader of the opposition has done is undertake the kentucky fried chicken kfc marketing overhaul of queensland politics
7709352 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7709353 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal and national party any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys
7709354 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7709355 it should be wound back and if corporate australia doesnt think that then maybe we should apply it to corporate australia as well

7709376 what most americans worry about profoundly is corporations or individuals with huge checks seeking the undue influence on lawmakers that such largesse is intended to purchase

7709379 he will ensure that the war against terrorists is fought intelligently with patience and resolve using all instruments of national power

7709393 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7709394 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7709395 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not because that would be speculation
7709396 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
7709397 i will tell you having visited israel a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7709398 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions

7709430 besides i have developed a new molecule this is the first time a polymer molecule is being used as spermicide
7709431 the drug has no major side effects however during trials we found that after taking the injection about 65 of the subjects developed temporary scrotal enlargements but things were normalised within two weeks we have researched on the method of injection that will check such minor effects
7709432 so far the drug failed in the case of five out of 250 subjects during the trial and that too because of sudden body movements while the injection was being administered as a result the people were double punctured but if doctors are trained accordingly then 100 percent success of the drug is guaranteed

7709546 only vessels built in the united states are eligible to operate in united states coastwise trade the present action involves the interpretation of federal law aimed at protecting the american shipbuilding trade the ultimate issue presented here is whether the coast guard erred in ruling that using equipment modules manufactured abroad but attached to vessels in shipyards in the united states does not disqualify those vessels from being considered american built under the jones act although at first blush this dispute may appear to demand diving into the specialized world of naval architecture ultimately the rigorous grammar lessons of an english teacher provide the ballast for the courts decision
7709547 the coast guards interpretation of the regulation at issue is reasonable in terms of the text history and purpose of the jones act accordingly the court finds that the interpretation at issue is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent and thus must be upheld

7709639 hips are already bringing benefits to consumers by providing important information to help families cut their fuel bills and carbon emissions and have reduced the price of property searches by increasing transparency in the home buying and selling process

7709645 offer her help for the case and say that this is a good chance
7709646 in the 35 meetings and conversations that the defendant and urip had between dec 5 2007 and feb 29 2008 as recorded by the kpk there is not a single one talking about a loan
7709647 just tell the truth because none of the defendants statements made sense
7709648 no i just have higher standards than you when it comes to television
7709649 but thats ok because as long as there are people like you walking around the world will never end
7709650 its simple as long as we have crazy people theres no reason to believe the world is going to end because its a crazy thought it wont happen the only time ill worry about it is when the majority starts to think the end is nigh but by that time well all be up to our necks in an apocalyptic shit storm and it wont matter
7709651 well i really do think the world is coming to an end
7709652 well thats great actually you comfort me my pathetic little dissenter

7709654 who says im crazy youre crazy anyone who believes honour responsibility and empathy to be detriments to humanity is most likely a complete loon themselves
7709655 so what most of the great thinkers of any period were unkempt and smelly people probably considered them crazy too
7709656 its simple really if you hold one opinion contrary to the generally accepted opinion of any population youre a bit odd but if almost every opinion you hold stands in opposition to the prevailing group wisdom of any given mass of humanity then you sir are a crazy person
7709657 thats a load of shit and you know it the freedom to hold and express dissenting opinions is one of the chief tenets of a democratic society
7709658 fair enough but it doesnt make you any less crazy and wheres your precious democracy when youre walking down the street all on your lonesome coming home from the bar or a movie maybe youre stumbling along talking to yourself about god knows what talking a bit too loudly for social convention talking about things the average responsible conformist wouldnt even dream of thinking let alone talk about there is no democracy on that level democracy is just another empty term like post traumatic stress disorder its just another abstraction of a couple of sentences in a textbook someone read aloud in history class in grade 10 it means nothing especially when some mean bastard smashes your head in against a curb for offending their firmly held beliefs on the sanctity of life and the glory of jesus h christ
7709659 the police dont give a rats ass about people like you youre crazy its their job to protect everyone else from you not the other way around youre fucked

7709704 it is an astonishingly extreme list not just by our inevitably liberalistic standards today but by the standards of the inter war era too
7709705 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect
7709706 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7709707 in the end we are certain that the governor will see firsthand that our plant is anything but a jungle and that when all the bitterness of the last few months is taken out of the equation that we are indeed on a course to being on an even higher road
7709708 all iowans not just those who work within his administration have a right to know the level of the governors concerns and the fact that their government is acting responsibly in response to the disturbing reports
7709709 i will tell you having visited israel just a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a
7709710 my job as president would be to try to make sure we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that we mobilize the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way we have to do it before israel feels its back is against the wall
7709711 consensus is something no one objects to but which no one believes in
7709712 true we were poorly served by a small minded president and his bungling administration but did liberals demand the right things of him or did we get trapped by the inclinations of our worldview
7709713 or did we get trapped by the inclinations of our worldview
7709714 the rubble is more beautiful than the original buildings were
7709715 i am seeing a modern day version of the fall of rome here
7709716 the current challenges facing airlines are immense but the board is confident that air new zealand is in a good position to create and seize opportunities in both the domestic and international businesses
7709717 based on the existing hedging policy and network plan in the current market conditions air new zealand expects to operate profitably if the average price of jet fuel is below 140 us dollars a barrel for the 2009 financial year
7709718 humanity in every age and even today looks to works of art to shed light upon its path and its destiny
7709719 were pleased with the progress of the venture however fund i will not to expand any further at this time maa will continue to acquire properties for its own account and anticipates putting in place a new acquisition fund we dont expect this decision to necessitate any change in our current ffo guidance for 2008
7709720 gonna get a little higher and see if i can hotwire reality
7709721 the slow response of most carmakers shows that the eu needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long term co2 targets
7709722 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7709723 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7709724 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream
7709725 we spend our time in a condominium in washington a condominium in phoenix some time over here in the state of california and then we have a place up in northern arizona
7709726 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7709727 the white house was saved by the action of one brave soldier john mccain

7709729 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time
7709730 in conclusion l salivarius cect5713 and l gasseri cect5714 appear to be an efficient alternative for the treatment of lactational infectious mastitis during lactation
7709731 we report that oral inoculation with a y pseudotuberculosis strain selected for its very low virulence induces an efficient immunity against bubonic plague without causing adverse reactions
7709732 this demonstrates that a live attenuated y pseudotuberculosis can be a promising vaccine against bubonic plague
7709733 try not to think about things ok im gonna get you home and after you get better ill answer anything you ask but for now just rest
7709734 brooke and i are thrilled shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us
7709735 de kerk is uit de tijd pastor echt uit de tijd
7709736 met diep leedwezen en met instemming van de parochie deelt r van rijn pastor hier ter plaatse u mee dat de fransiscuskerk dood is ieder die deze kerk de laatste eer wil bewijzen wordt verwacht in de dienst van a s zondag 11 00 uur
7709737 jullie hebben mij verteld dat jullie van mening zijn dat de kerk dood is jullie hebben zelfs geen hoop op een wederopstanding daarom vraag ik jullie om n voor n langs deze kist te lopen en afscheid te nemen van de dode als jullie de dode hebben gezien verlaat dan de kerk via de oostelijke deur als iedereen gepasseerd is zal ik de dienst besluiten mocht iemand toch nog geloven dat een herleving mogelijk is dan verzoek ik die persoon om via de noord deur weer binnen te komen
7709738 there is no question that unless he and congress change their views on open borders mass immigration exporting jobs and importing willing workers our soldiers may soon be fighting a war on a third continent north america
7709739 mr bush and the republican party deserve most of the blame for our national crisis
7709740 for four years this republican administration in control of the white house the house of representatives and the senate is responsible for holding the borders open exposing americans to terrorism uncontrolled immigration increased crime and third world diseases
7709741 he is intent on creating a borderless hemispheric free trade zone from the tip of south america to the north pole he is trying to emulate the european model but unlike europe where most of the member nations are all first world economies the americas model has the richest and most advanced nation living next door to a banana republic complete with corrupt politicians and oppressed impoverished and illiterate people
7709742 but to accomplish his dream he is required to hold our borders open knowing that he is putting us at greater risk of terrorist attack he knows that our health and welfare systems will buckle and collapse under the strain of massive overpopulation bush knows that our environment will suffer he knows that thousands of americans will die of third world disease for which we have no immunity this president knows that our social fabric our language culture and heritage will be torn to shreds
7709743 the american people who are unemployed and underemployed those who feel their taxes are subsidizing illegal aliens health and welfare instead of funding social security amp medicare those who are running out of money and those who have suffered at the hands of illegal aliens will take matters into their own hands
7709744 it is not at all surprising that this group has already been branded by president bush as
7709745 i am sorry to say i believe it is quite likely that blood will be spilled in american streets this year because of president bushs indifference to the american people
7709746 having been dazzled by a clever campaign strategy that focused voters attention away from americas real pressing problems to emotional
7709747 unemployment numbers are up the stock market is headed down the dollar is collapsing worldwide even as he is calling for open borders and guest worker programs the president is announcing the end of social security health care is no longer affordable to the average american but is available at our expense to illegal aliens
7709748 the weakest link in our homeland security our borders remain wide open to the extent that illegal migration today is as high as it ever was prior to 9 11
7709749 this outrage continues despite the fact that we now have hard evidence that terrorists are using mexico as a staging area to stockpile their weapons and their troops our governments response to these facts has been astounding cut backs in border personnel hiring freezes at homeland security delays in deploying improved surveillance equipment at border checkpoints harbors and airports etc
7709750 unfortunately the possibility exists that president bush and his utopian fantasies of a world without borders have powerful allies on the other side of the aisle
7709751 most of washingtons elite from both parties are members of the trilateral commission an organization whose stated goals are reflected in president bushs current border and immigration policies and his support for hemispheric treaties
7709752 the symptom is when those we elect begin to feel that they are superior to the people they represent
7709753 how soon we forget history government is not reason government is not eloquence it is force and like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
7709754 hopefully this government will wake up and recognize that as a servant of the people it should obey our constitution
7709755 the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion
7709756 new laws prohibit financial aid from one term to be applied to another term yadda yadda blah
7709757 pray tell me good madam what the fuck difference it makes if i pay you with a post dated check when the intent here is that im still paying with the money refunded from my financial aid doesnt that seem a little underhanded and totally counter intuitive its just another hoop isnt it
7709758 fine but you havent seen the last of me im going to get you a check ill ride home and ride my bike back again in a giant waste of your time and mine and ill stand in this line for a half hour again so you can have you post dated check this whole thing while i understand it is your job is a big fucking pain in the ass and is not lean at all too many useless steps to waste peoples time

7709761 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7709762 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7709763 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7709764 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them

7709775 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7709776 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7709777 i have come here tonight to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect
7709778 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7709779 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days
7709780 together we have known success and seen failure victory and defeat
7709781 for me this is a new hope and this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock
7709782 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7709783 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7709784 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7709785 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7709786 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7709787 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7709788 nobody in the world knows barack obama better than his wife michelle
7709789 her personal perspective and what she offers will i think be very compelling to the american public
7709790 about the importance of standing up for what you believe
7709791 encouraged us to explore and ask questions and delight in unexpected discoveries and surprising answers
7709792 she brought us to telescopes and microscopes to remind us that there was a world a vast world beyond our limited reach
7709793 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7709794 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7709795 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7709796 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no
7709797 there are still a chunk of union voters who are undecided and there are some who are nervous about him
7709798 we feel that race is an issue its not the only issue its complicated by other issues such as unfamiliarity and inexperience but it is an issue
7709799 what the barack obama campaign needs to do is tell his story
7709800 its all those other blue collared workers who are not members of unions that hes going to have problems with
7709801 but if he can convince us itll make it easier to convince the rest of them
7709802 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
7709803 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
7709804 i will tell you having visited israel just a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a
7709805 my job as president would be to try to make sure we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that we mobilize the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way we have to do it before israel feels its back is against the wall
7709806 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7709807 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7709808 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7709809 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7709810 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7709811 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7709812 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7709813 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will
7709814 based on these results we conclude that this new ethanol based hand sanitizer is a promising option for reducing the transmission of enteric viruses including norovirus by food handlers and care providers
7709815 before weaning the mother has the monopoly on providing resources directly to her offspring
7709816 after weaning the father directly provides a greater share of resources to his offspring
7709817 i dont have any sense that this will somehow lead to a cure for pws but it does present a new area for those interested in the disease to study and hopefully a new understanding of how the disease functions
7709818 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
7709819 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
7709820 this new knowledge suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration
7709821 why not take a page out of one diseases book in the fight against other diseases
7709822 the most important thing to us is how we manage our relationship with end users the way to go forward is through communication a lot of people talk about software as a service and it makes them nervous we are not going to cut the reseller out
7709823 australia is a very developed and advanced market which looks a lot like the united states in terms of technology trends and reseller trends
7709824 we were looking for local talent in terms of their development business and were interested in moving into new emerging markets
7709825 symantec is looking to grow and the way to grow is by acquiring another partner to enter into a new place in the market our aim is to buy to build and to partner with other companies it helps us to broaden our reach
7709826 any time you have confusion its an opportunity for partners to take that confusion out for the customer and help them understand the best way forward
7709827 if i learn a lot of spanish will i turn brown
7709828 it was not quite the bodys rejection of the defibrillator
7709829 but its a means for a body to cleanse itself of something foreign to it
7709830 this is a far reaching program designed to comprehensively restructure and reposition the business for years to come
7709831 we wanted to make a major change today across the company in order to accelerate our building of a strong and dynamic integrated media business
7709832 obama claims hes looking out for our families in an economic downturn but ask yourself this if obama cares so much about your family why doesnt he take care of his own family first

7709859 a man is ethical only when life as such is sacred to him that of plants and animals as that of his fellow men and when he devotes himself helpfully to all life that is in need of help
7709860 i believe that at the end of the 20th century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted
7709861 she hugged my father and told him thanks thanks for having a son that shows compassion to my son when no one else will for including him when others find him a burden when my dad told me this my heart dropped it dropped because i showed no compassion the first time i spent with him i was hard hearted and angry because i saw him as others see him then it was gods compassion that flooded that rushed in it was his compassion that this boy felt and it was his compassion that softened my heart to be more like his god took something about with which i was stubborn and selfish and made it a powerful tool for changing his kingdom i invite your compassion all over again

7709863 i think one of the biggest mistakes weve made strategically after 9 11 was to fail to finish the job here focus our attention here we got distracted by iraq
7709864 organized a modest multinational force and sent them into afghanistan to arrest osama bin laden
7709865 the drug war has failed despite 50 billion spent annually
7709866 theres something wrong with 38 billion spent on education amp 700 billion spent on defense
7709867 i would be the best friend that homeschoolers ever had in the white house
7709868 major strategic vulnerability a serious threat to our security our economy and the well being of our planet

7709876 knowing the plane was bad it took off with my seven year old niece

7709883 as the stats from this month and previous months indicate theres large upwards momentum ready for the myspace music launch
7709884 its frustrating because i want to be here and help the team but for me not being 100 to go out there its not just hurting the team its me not being 100
7709885 i was told nothing could make it worse which is why i wanted to pitch through it it just hasnt gone away
7709886 but the bottom line is we cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race which means that guys are going to have to step up
7709887 well watch him play watch him perform watch the level the team is playing at with him performing and see where we are
7709888 i had gone to the nfl for seven years and when i came back i thought the biggest change in college football was how much teams were training in the summer and in the offseason
7709889 more and more kids are going to summer school and working out on their own to get started early
7709890 coach lubick always made character a big part of his recruiting and this is a group of really hardworking kids
7709891 and theyre hungry too because the school had a lot of success in the past but these kids havent had that success
7709892 i can see where we are and i know where we can get to
7709893 im confident the plan is in place and confident we have the right staff in place as far as a timetable i dont know
7709894 but at this place were capable of doing what we did in the 90s weve done it here before and i think we can do it again
7709895 its special in that i went to school here and my wife nancy is from this area and if you get a chance to come back to where you played theres some passion and fire in that regard
7709896 and im kind of like a recruit too and this is a nice place to live
7709897 it just felt right am i the right fit i think i am some administrators that i knew before are still here and i was familiar with a lot of fans and the community and the university itself
7709898 there were a couple of road games that werent on tv so i sat in the car and listened on the radio i blamed myself and felt i was responsible if i hadnt gotten hurt i would have been able to help out
7709899 i knew he played quarterback here and coached here before but i really didnt know anything else about him
7709900 but after he got the job he called a few guys and let us know right away what was happening i was impressed by that it let us know he was in control right away
7709901 if youre a new quarterback you might not really be used to any system but i know if youre breaking in a new quarterback it could be peyton manning and he can have growing pains
7709902 we have to surround him with good people and get him comfortable
7709903 there may be an easier way to get going but this is a great game for both schools
