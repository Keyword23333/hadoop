220039 but then they see it looks really nice it softens the look of the house taking away the black driveway
220040 its all about water infiltration into the ground instead of running out onto the street and down into our sewers and into our lakes and rivers
220041 the more groundwater you can keep on the site the less damage its going to do to the environment and the habitats of fish and things in the rivers and lakes
220042 what were planning to do is keep the grass low and use a snowblower on it and see how that works out and at the end of the winter well reassess
220043 we want to know how much maintenance its going to take over the longer term versus an asphalt driveway but one thing we do know is you wont have to spray it with tar every year so thats one benefit
220044 its not for every day in and out constantly because youre going to wear out the turf
220045 if you leave a car parked on it and it cant get sun for days at a time the grass will yellow out

220070 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
220071 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
220072 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
220073 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
220074 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
220075 the worst mistake ive made in eight years of lobbying for this industry is thinking that rational arguments are going to carry the day

220079 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
220080 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
220081 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track
220082 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face unlike sen obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses
220083 is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies
220084 obama simply asks that big oil companies contribute a reasonable share of the windfall profits they receive from high oil prices over the next five years to pay for emergency assistance for families right now

220097 i couldnt believe that i had been picked to come to korea the 75 year old hybki said
220098 to tell you the truth i thought there was some kind of a gimmick because no one gives you a free trip hotel accommodations and meals
220099 i thought i would go ahead and send in my name and address and see what happened he said
220100 it was really something when i got this letter he said pulling out the letter
220101 who would have thought that i would get this chance to come back here again
220102 in 1951 they needed more troops in korea so they called up the illinois national guard and shipped us off to california hybki recalled
220103 we were supposed to wait until we got up to division strength but they needed more men over here so they started breaking us up and sent us over here individually to fill in spots in various units
220104 wed take a hill and then a couple of days later we were forced off that hill by the chinese he said
220105 the people werent living a life they were existing because there was nothing he recalled sadly
220106 right up until the armistice was signed both sides were firing their artillery every night hybki said
220107 and kept it up right until the armistice went into effect
220108 we had about four companies in our compound so we scratched together whatever food we could find hamburgers hot dogs and lots of beer he said smiling
220109 we played some ballgames and listened to music there was not a lot we could do
220110 i thought about coming back here after my sons had grown up he said
220111 but the older i got the thought of coming back here sort of faded
220112 we went to seoul tower yesterday saturday and i tried to find this cathedral that i visited when i was here he said
220113 it took me awhile but i found it and pointed it out to him
220114 all these koreans came in and lit all these candles so they could have midnight mass hybki said
220115 when i got called up to go to korea i was working at westclox a clock factory so after i got back home i went to work there again he said
220116 it was like i had been on vacation you just went back home and carried on with your life
220117 it meant a lot to me to find his name he added sadly
220118 he was only 19 years old when he was killed in action
220119 this is more than i expected i cant believe what the fki has done for us and the hospitality shown to us by the korean people he said
220120 you feel a little different after coming back here he said
220121 i can see now that everything was appreciated and worth it
220122 i wish we didnt have to be picked up at 10 oclock i wish we could stay until 11 or 12
220123 dear drs please forgive me for this horrible transgression i have no where else to turn so i ask you to mercifully gently and lovingly please help him sleep his name is kaiser and hes 16 and a half years old hes been my friend my teacher my pupil my lifelong loving and loyal companion
220124 be good to him as you would your own child for hes been mine for a loving lifetime
220125 im a homeless disabled vet and i know when its time to say goodbye to a friend and its time now hes such a part of my being ill once again be alone in my life i love you kaiser thank you for caring sincerely kaisers soul mate

220128 consumers believe that retailers like wal mart know the quality and safety of products they sell
220129 retailers benefit from that trust and must be held accountable for the products they sell
220130 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations

220133 the plunging sales call for drastic action but unfortunately management is unlikely to do much
220134 whether consumer preference stays focused on smaller more fuel efficient vehicles or not selling these lower margin products will not provide the level of cash flow gm was counting on with suvs and trucks to help fund the north american turnaround
220135 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans
220136 it is a decent margin but it is not a landslide
220137 it would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008
220138 it could be because of pollution or just ordinary weather conditions
220139 for example it can be very hazy in a shower room but its not necessarily caused by pollution
220140 i havent seen what contribution theyre really making but they are enjoying various benefits

220158 because we westerners have such high expectations of america we stamp with justified fury every time america bullies the rest of the world we must also now make similar demands of china in order for that enormous nation to emerge from its long dark age into the twenty first century free tibet now

220162 after the peace we saw schools built and changes happening it transformed south sudan
220163 now always on the horizon there could be a war again and our progress could all be taken away
220164 it is a sign of the level of tensions when what should have been a minor incident turned into a full scale battle that is displacing citizens
220165 what we need now is coordinated international action especially from the members of the security council

220183 by signing this law i am refusing to let that happen
220184 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months

220190 i dont care about his inactivity i know what i can do and i know how i can fight i know i will win this it is not a question in my mind him not having fought in a while does not play into this for me
220191 if i cant beat him then what am i doing with my career what am i doing i have to beat him for me this is do or die i have no choice
220192 for me this fight is like coming home i grew up on showtime that is where i got ranked that is where everything started for me i feel comfortable on showtime because it is home
220193 tomorrow night you will see the old ishe mixed with the new ishe i am just going to keep throwing the punches and you will notice my growth but you will still see the old ishe

220200 these findings also indicate that where climate change induced increases in smog do occur damaging effects on ecosystems agriculture and health will be especially pronounced due to increases in the frequency of extreme pollution events
220201 its nice to know that we are putting renewable energy down and with zero pollution
220202 i dont screw up the environment i save a few bucks
220203 when we first put it up id spend hours looking at this meter in disbelief
220204 youre building typically the projects way out in the middle of nowhere long distances from the load centers
220205 when i first came to west texas it was just yknow cattle and oil rigs that was it
220206 once testing has been completed and a new management technique has been identified we will publish a description of this new technique along with additional faqs to benefit our customers prior to rolling it out nationally
220207 we expect to continue these trials for at least 30 days as we evolve the new protocol agnostic network management technique
220208 yes we are expanding the trials to get more data to determine the best solution
220209 again the goal is to migrate to a protocol agnostic technique before the end of the year and we remain committed to fully disclosing all the details to all of our customers once they are determined
220210 the overall conclusion was that we really needed to slow down on biofuel production and use because all the new evidence shows there are some potentially harmful effects
220211 we shouldnt be taking agricultural land and growing biofuels on it
220212 in that sense of course if we are displacing food then that means it has got to come from somewhere else so one can easily see why there might be an effect
220213 they dont help anything and in fact can make problems worse
220214 can be both workable and effective for addressing global climate change
220215 one point is clear the potential regulation of greenhouse gases under any portion of the clean air act could result in unprecedented expansion of epa authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land
220216 our agencies have serious concerns with this suggestion because it does not fairly recognize the enormous and we believe insurmountable burdens difficulties and costs and likely limited benefits of using the clean air act
220217 epas approach to this has been completely thrown out by the white house which is only attempting to stall any kind of clean up
220218 it sounds like the bush administration is trying to ignore the supreme court and to pretend it doesnt exist
220219 the bureaucratic equivalent of saying that the dog ate your homework
220220 the white house has taken an earnest attempt by their own climate experts to respond to the supreme courts mandate to address global warming pollution and turned it into a frankensteins monster
220221 our point on this is that epa has set forth a road map which literally throws the entire way which we manage the environment and economy in complete turmoil
220222 when we saw the first draft it clearly said we could make it work

220245 i constantly marvel at how bill iwocpo and his disciples at abel to yzerman can be so pompous and full of themselves throughout every regular season but come playoff time they collapse into wavering puddles of stress and nervousness as they anxiously await the impending and unavoidable collapse of the red wings in the post season

220254 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits
220255 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
220256 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
220257 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
220258 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
220259 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u

220298 boston bars are not supposed to be open all night but the rules that require 2 a m closings have specifically to do with the serving of alcoholic beverages and since june 16 the other side has been operating as a non alcoholic juice bar a type of establishment that is entirely new to the boston nightclub scene and while clubowners and licensing authorities differ over whether such clubs can or should adhere to the same rules that govern taverns the other side and an adjacent smaller room called pennys arcade have been operating under an obscure state statute controlling dance halls and the only thing that that law prohibits is admitting kids under age 15 if they are not accompanied by adults

220414 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
220415 an important part of my compromise with yahoo is that the board in the settlement agreement has agreed that any meaningful transaction including the strategy in dealing with that transaction will be fully discussed with the entire board before any final decision is made
220416 in todays corporate governance system where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
220417 realizing i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight
220418 we believe the current board acted with care and diligence when evaluating microsofts offers
220419 we would prefer that the company and mr icahn reach a mutual agreement on the composition of the board and end this disruptive proxy contest
220420 if microsoft wants to acquire yahoo it can make the terms and conditions of its offer public if yahoo shareholders support it i am confident the board of yahoo will accept it
220421 he meeting the first since microsoft made its unsolicited offer jan 31 marks a breakthrough in communication between the two camps following yahoos rejection of microsofts offer last month still the meeting wasnt a negotiation and no bankers attended these people said the session was intended to allow microsoft to present its vision of a combined company and yahoo executives mostly listened one of the people said no further talks have been scheduled
220422 yahoo was never the strategy we were pursuing it was a way to accelerate our online advertising business

220447 weve had the best of both worlds increasing supply and increasing pricing really driven by the whole health interest in blueberries
220448 we have to continue to keep supply and demand in balance for the blueberry growers
220449 a lot of people who traditionally buy from growers theyre not committing and its creating a lot of uncertainty in the market
220450 this industry was due for a tremendous growing pain and i think this year is the first year of the effects of that its due to the success of the crop farmers do jump on each others bandwagons when theres a successful crop

220474 post offices in birmingham provide a range of valuable services both commercially and socially in our city and act as a focal point for community interaction especially those who have come to rely on them which include many senior citizens and some of our more vulnerable residents
220475 there are already over 7 000 residents for each post office in the city so reducing the network further will have a significant negative effect on both the accessibility and the quality of the service if these closures take place there will be 8 700 people per post office which is simply too many per branch
220476 we have encouraged members of the public to contribute to the consultation by writing ringing or emailing post office ltd directly
220477 we have also had great support from the media in birmingham especially the birmingham mail and the big debate held earlier this month in the council chamber allowed us to see first hand how passionate people in the city are about keeping their local post office open
220478 the joint scrutiny committee meeting held this month directly after the big debate also showed determined opposition to these proposed closures from across the city and scrutiny members have also contributed to the gathering of evidence provided in this report
220479 it is important that post office ltd spends time reading the additional information we have provided and intensely scrutinises each and every proposed closure to ensure that critical factors including levels of deprivation and regeneration plans are given full consideration
220480 since 1999 55 post offices have already closed within the city which has reduced accessibility to services particularly for our most vulnerable residents and this has had a negative impact on the viability of our neighbourhoods and the regeneration of our deprived areas
220481 closing more would make the situation even worse so we want to make sure we have provided post office ltd with our most up to date accurate information which we are now submitting
220482 we have exceeded our target for reclaiming materials from the demolition and clearing of the site much of which has been used to create the correct land levels and roads within the olympic park
220483 as we move into the construction phase we have set ourselves another incredibly ambitious target to recover and reuse or recycle 90 per cent of the construction waste this is unprecedented for a development of this size scale and complexity
220484 this demonstrates how we are integrating sustainability into every element of the construction of the olympic park and we hope it leaves a legacy for future projects to follow
220485 we are the first ever major project to be awarded an iso14001 certificate for an integrated environment and sustainability management system this will give the assurance that our ambitions for sustainability and environmental management are monitored audited and delivered
220486 our work shows that the original method developed by yamanaka works great
220487 it opens the door to being able to make patient specific stem cell lines to treat diseases that affect people very late in life like parkinsons or alzheimers disease
220488 our lack of understanding of the disease process is preventing us from developing more efficient cures
220489 because the disease is happening in the spinal cord we dont have access to living samples of neurons undergoing the disease process but now we have in the culture dish the very cells affected by the disease

220502 i started writing music again with some guys two and a half years ago and weve been playing around the country and overseas universal heard it again and again and here we are we write original stuff and they liked it so here we are id say its rock n roll but its rooted in my country roots the way i grew up modern west is the name

220510 regardless of whether youve watched the other films the third mummy entry is a headache inducing mess

220519 saritas early work departed from the prevalent hardware centric view of consistency to a combined hardware software view
220520 she observed that for common well synchronized programs which she formalized as data race free we can provide both programmability of sequential consistency and high performance
220521 sarita almost single handedly convinced the c community that data race free was not only efficient but any proposed departure would be too complex to formalize reasonably
220522 largely in response amd and intel recently announced their memory model specifications including changes to be compatible with c and java
220523 before term limits there were 10 or 12 key races and now there are easily 30 races that are truly competitive its tough to wade through who is who
220524 and the presidential races always suck up a lot of money
220525 this is not the time for a lot of hype
220526 its a time to actually go out and prove it
220527 clearly there are some who want to blow this out of proportion

220534 i truly feel we are in for a long haul when it comes to this recession there is still alot of truth telling that needs to come to the market and the consumer will bear the results
220535 until housing regains its footing the economy is a house on sinking sand
220536 this isnt like your dads recession this is a whole new ballgame the mbas have outsourced so many jobs that there is nothing left to manufacture to turn this economy around
220537 basically this country needs to make stuff look at all the emerging and solid economies around the world show me one that is strictly an importer and doesnt manufacture stuff
220538 the economy is tanking everywhere i look nobody i know is spending like they used to which is a good thing and there is only one question left is this the great recession or the great depression
220539 it all depends upon consumer spending we wont recover from this for a least several years so dont hold your breath and try to call a bottom the bottom is a long way off and nobody knows how far down it will go yet
220540 consumers have pulled back but what i hear about most is a lifestyle change i believe we are in for 10 years of relatively flat growth not the end of the world just a sea change in how people will live and what is really important
220541 many of the hard times today are the fault of the people who swipe their home atm to buy another new suv or a house beyond their means it is certainly a tough lesson to learn but it has to happen
220542 people who lived beyond their means now cant pay back that debt due to ballooning costs turns out they should have saved money while they could
220543 many of us are doing the right thing and are still in a pickle because of circumstances beyond our control
220544 look companies are making record profits 98 of homes are being paid for on time and my last trip to home depot i was fighting the crowds somebody out there is spending this
220545 the economic slump comprises industries that are slumping airlines autos homebuilding mortgages real estate etc and industries that are expanding agriculture energy health care mining technology etc the gains outnumber the losses so we get slow growth but the growth is slower than the rate of productivity gains so jobs are slowly shed
220546 this slump will eventually end and growth will return then some day well have another slump it goes on and on and on and on
220547 the first and second amendments of the constitution are twin pillars of americas unique form of self government writes sandy froman

220553 on may 17 2005 the white houses political affairs office sent an e mail message to agencies throughout the executive branch directing them to find jobs for 108 people on a list of priority candidates who had loyally served the president we simply want to place as many of our bush loyalists as possible the white house emphasized in a follow up message according to a little noticed passage of a justice department report released monday about politicization in the departments hiring of civil service prosecutors and immigration officials
220554 no intention of moving the bill through his committee unless the language is first altered to ensure that there is no possible way it could be construed as authorizing any type of military action against iran
220555 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
220556 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
220557 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
220558 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
220559 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
220560 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
220561 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
220562 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
220563 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
220564 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
220565 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
220566 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
220567 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
220568 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
220569 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
220570 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
220571 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
220572 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
220573 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
220574 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
220575 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
220576 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
220577 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
220578 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
220579 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
220580 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
220581 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
220582 we have been informed that 16 students died and 27 were injured we think that there are still four or six more children under the rubble
220583 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
220584 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
220585 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
220586 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
220587 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
220588 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
220589 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
220590 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
220591 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
220592 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
220593 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
220594 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
220595 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida

220598 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
220599 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
220600 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
220601 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
220602 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

220629 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
220630 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
220631 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road

220634 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
220635 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
220636 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
220637 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
220638 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
220639 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road

220642 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

220680 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
220681 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
220682 we found significant variations for early stage prostate cancer quality indicators there were differences in care from community hospitals to cancer centers to teaching hospitals there were also disparities in care from one region of the country to another but there were no racial disparities suggesting equity in care once a patient initiates treatment
220683 if these variations in care can be eliminated thereby providing uniform quality it may lead to improved outcomes for patients
220684 ships and sails proper for heavenly air should be fashioned
220685 photon pressure played orbital soccer with the echo 1 thin film balloon in orbit the shards were flung far and wide by sunlight
220686 the year long work on preliminary design demonstrated that indeed solar sailing was a feasible spacecraft propulsion technique
220687 some call znamya 2 a sail because it was made of a large lightweight reflector and unfurled like a solar sail might be unfurled
220688 in fact if i were asked to demonstrate solar sail technology and was constrained to deploy it from a large spacecraft i might design a sail like znamya
220689 cosmos 1 was a fully developed solar sail spacecraft intended to fly only under the influence of solar pressure for control of the spacecrafts orbit
220690 if all had gone as planned the us based planetary society working with russia would have been the first to fly a fully functional though performance limited solar sail in space
220691 it would have been the first spin stabilized free flying solar sail to fly in space
220692 these sail designs are robust enough for deployment in a one atmosphere one gravity environment and are scalable to much larger solar sails perhaps as much as 150 meters on one side
220693 a nasa flight test is possible by the year 2010
220694 our primary objective is to demonstrate successful deployment of a lightweight solar sail structure in low earth orbit
220695 if and its a big if they can measure the solar pressure they will have demonstrated solar pressure as a primary means of orbital maneuvering theyll have to show conclusively the effects of solar pressure with a convincingly high signal to noise ratio above the forces resulting from the residual atmospheric pressure
220696 the orbit available to us in this launch opportunity is so low it may not allow us to stay in orbit long enough for solar pressure effects to accumulate to a measurable degree we are going to have to look closely at the flight data to see if we can make that determination
220697 success would be huge for the future of space exploration
220698 solar sailing is the only means known to achieve practical interstellar flight
220699 it is our hope that the first solar sail flight will spur the development of solar sail technology so that this dream can be made real
220700 twas all so pretty a sail it seemed as if it could not be and some folks thought twas a dream theyd dreamed of sailing that beautiful sea
220701 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
220702 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
220703 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
220704 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
220705 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
220706 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
220707 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
220708 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
220709 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
220710 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
220711 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
220712 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
220713 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
220714 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
220715 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
220716 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
220717 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
220718 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
220719 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
220720 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
220721 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
220722 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
220723 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
220724 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
220725 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
220726 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
220727 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
220728 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
220729 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
220730 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
220731 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
220732 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
220733 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
220734 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
220735 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
220736 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
220737 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
220738 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
220739 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
220740 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
220741 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
220742 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
220743 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
220744 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
220745 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
220746 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
220747 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
220748 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
220749 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
220750 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
220751 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
220752 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
220753 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
220754 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
220755 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
220756 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
220757 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
220758 short term solutions to our long term energy problems arent just ineffective they will actually prepare the problem much worse
220759 freedom is not the right to do what we want but what we ought
220760 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
220761 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways

220776 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
220777 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
220778 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
220779 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
220780 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
220781 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
220782 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
220783 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
220784 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
220785 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
220786 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
220787 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
220788 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
220789 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
220790 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
220791 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
220792 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
220793 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
220794 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
220795 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
220796 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
220797 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
220798 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
220799 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
220800 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
220801 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
220802 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
220803 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
220804 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
220805 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
220806 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
220807 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
220808 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
220809 the difference is that because the winds are so much stronger here in the u s we are actually providing more wind generated electricity than germany
220810 we need to back away from fossil fuel and embrace renewable energy the survival of the world depends on it
220811 strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels
220812 i felt like if youre going to clean something it really should be clean
220813 but i had seven children i wanted to go on home i told him im not staying these arent slavery times anymore he said i had to stay i walked
220814 one day we decided to march on the welfare office we asked to see their policies their manual of how they would treat us they said the state couldnt do that so we went up the back steps on a friday afternoon went into the directors office and told him we wouldnt let him leave
220815 storming caesars palace how black mothers fought their own war on poverty
220816 finally we understand that the civil rights movement was a lot bigger and longer than martin luther king as wonderful and important as he was
220817 there are so many levels on which this movement was important not only statewide but nationwide
220818 and theres no question ruby was in the absolute forefront
220819 as long as they graduated and walked across that stage that was enough
220820 it was exciting to see how poor people could stand up
220821 just the way she looked you could feel her power it was so uplifting
220822 im glad shes finally being recognized for all that shes done
220823 so many people give up homes so many jobless people
220824 let somebody make me wealthy before i leave just for one year
220825 i would buy me a nice home in a decent neighborhood i would have me a better car i would love to go to one of those hotels lay up and have a massage i would go to paris london italy i would live for once in my life
220826 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
220827 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
220828 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
220829 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
220830 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
220831 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
220832 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
220833 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
220834 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
220835 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
220836 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
220837 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
220838 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
220839 hes got the emmy the oscar hes a nobel laureate why would he want to go back to that
220840 her favorite scene is me running naked covered in blood down a corridor with a chain saw in my hand she doesnt really understand why everyone found it so controversial
220841 i dont know an actor just tries to figure out a role
220842 i think too much is put into saving celebrities and we need do more about saving animals we need rehab for animals
220843 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
220844 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
220845 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
220846 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
220847 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
220848 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
220849 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
220850 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
220851 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
220852 the voters we need to get are people not a whole lot unlike obama
220853 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
220854 are you better off now than you were four years ago
220855 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
220856 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
220857 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
220858 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
220859 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
220860 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
220861 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
220862 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
220863 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
220864 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
220865 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
220866 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
220867 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
220868 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
220869 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
220870 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
220871 en la vida no todo es avanzar a veces un paso atr s
220872 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
220873 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
220874 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
220875 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
220876 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
220877 in our society today it is better to be guilty and rich than to be innocent and poor
220878 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
220879 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
220880 you know its not about you its about your country
220881 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
220882 the arctic ocean is warming up icebergs are growing scarcer in some places and the seals are finding the water too hot
220883 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
220884 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
220885 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
220886 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
220887 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
220888 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
220889 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
220890 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
220891 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
220892 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
220893 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
220894 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
220895 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
220896 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
220897 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
220898 the only republican who promises to end the of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
220899 a broader range of americans than the rest of the republican field
220900 hard to find an issue on which he has not repositioned himself to the right since he was
220901 the real straight talker a profile in courage more seasoned than the current president a patriot of course honest and respected in the media he has all the pluses in the world of a sort of a you know an if you will a real war hero
220902 the environment is the voters number one concern about continued republican leadership of congress
220903 o ur nations continued prosperity hinges on our ability to solve environmental problems and sustain the natural resources on which we all depend
220904 we have two oilmen in the white house the logical follow up from that is 3 a gallon gasoline it is no accident it is a cause and effect a cause and effect
220905 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
220906 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
220907 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
220908 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
220909 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
220910 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
220911 risks from the internet particularly social networking sites and sites hosting user generated content
220912 youtube is failing to do enough to protect children from the dark side of the internet
220913 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
220914 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
220915 the history of the social security debate has taught that too many specifics especially during a presidential campaign has polarized the debate
220916 history of the decline and fall of the roman empire
220917 driven less by thought and more by feelings this doesnt mean hes totally reactive or without logic or thought processes it just means hes a fighter pilot he reacts to circumstances
220918 in the many many years that ive been in washington
220919 john mccain is far and away the most emotional politician i have ever met
220920 people dont understand that so they keep talking about his temperament his temper he reacts emotionally therefore unpredictably
220921 i didnt expect it to come so quickly its been hard to keep up with theres been articles in the papers that say ive got too big for my boots but people who know me say im just the same
220922 you have only a short period of time in your life to make your mark and im there now
220923 it has definitely helped to have my dad open some doors for me
220924 my son ben and i are on two separate networks and different coasts if anything id have less pull getting him on
220925 opportunity to be on the news and drive the news for sports fans
220926 originated loans with little or no regard for the borrowers financial ability to afford the loans or to sustain homeownership
220927 joe sixpack still fails to understand how this mess and disaster came about
220928 loco estoy embolado de hacer siempre lo mismo vamos a chorear culeao
220929 the album is considerably slicker sounding than most of the other claire releases and you know that means something considering that most of these groups spend lots of time with their effects and in the studio making sure everything is just perfect fortunately for the daysleepers its songs are good enough to stand on their own even without the studio wizardry
220930 this is music that grabs you not just music to drift away to its an example of playing genre right using its tropes while adding new life
220931 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
220932 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
220933 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
220934 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
220935 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
220936 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
220937 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
220938 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
220939 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
220940 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
220941 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
220942 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
220943 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
220944 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
220945 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
220946 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
220947 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
220948 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
220949 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
220950 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
220951 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
220952 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
220953 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
220954 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
220955 the most massive peacetime commitment of funds and resources in our nations history to develop americas own alternative sources of fuel
220956 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
220957 20 percent of our energy coming from solar power by the year 2000
220958 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
220959 give us a blank check and we will drill where we want
220960 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
220961 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
220962 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
220963 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
220964 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
220965 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
220966 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
220967 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
220968 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
220969 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
220970 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
220971 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
220972 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
220973 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
220974 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
220975 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
220976 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
220977 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
220978 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
220979 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
220980 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
220981 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
220982 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
220983 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
220984 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
220985 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
220986 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
220987 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
220988 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
220989 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
220990 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
220991 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
220992 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
220993 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
220994 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
220995 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
220996 even coal has a role to play if the carbon dioxide is captured and safely buried but clean coal does not exist right now
220997 but we cannot do the job with renewable and efficiency alone
220998 an expanded role for nuclear energy as well as natural gas and clean coal with carbon capture and storage
220999 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
221000 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
221001 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
221002 climate change and energy security are not just threats they are opportunities
221003 we need to change the debate in this country from what we cant do to what we can do
221004 a new political environment in this country that will allow the next president to do what i think the next president is going to think is the right thing to do
221005 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
221006 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
221007 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
221008 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
221009 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
221010 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
221011 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
221012 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
221013 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
221014 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
221015 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
221016 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
221017 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
221018 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
221019 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
221020 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
221021 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
221022 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
221023 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
221024 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
221025 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
221026 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
221027 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
221028 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
221029 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
221030 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
221031 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
221032 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
221033 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
221034 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
221035 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
221036 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
221037 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
221038 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
221039 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
221040 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
221041 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
221042 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
221043 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
221044 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
221045 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
221046 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
221047 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
221048 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
221049 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
221050 this was a vicious attack where the victim nearly lost his life
221051 if it wasnt for the early and expert intervention of west sussex ambulance personnel he may well have done
221052 i thank them for their support and also the victim and his family
221053 i would hope that this conviction will send out a message to any young person who is thinking about carrying a knife
221054 every time i expressed a negative emotion to anyone they would say are you sure you want to get married are you having doubts it was like any emotion besides pure joy led them to believe i was having doubts i knew in ever fiber of my being that this was the man with whom i was meant to spend the rest of my life but did that mean i wasnt allowed to have any difficult feelings before making the biggest commitment i had ever made
221055 one day she looked around and saw that everyone had become engaged in their own wedding drama this tendency toward high drama can lead many brides to feel isolated not only feeling alone in the internal world of their emotional transformations but also that the drama of the wedding lies solely on their shoulders
221056 lets just hold off on plane tickets i mean come on were not even sure this thing is really happening
221057 obviously im not the only one of the group of us that is surprised youre really doing this
221058 if you dont want to go through with this you dont have to
221059 the one thing you have to be is completely sure
221060 if laura decides not to do this well be fine with it i mean obviously the airplane tickets cant be refunded but
221061 brides tend to feel hemmed in by the ramifications of the wedding they attempt to silence the feelings they think should not exist this creates an even greater feeling of aloneness internally brides are yearning to connect with others who can understand what they are experiencing during this time
221062 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
221063 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
221064 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
221065 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
221066 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
221067 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
221068 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
221069 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
221070 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
221071 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
221072 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office

221102 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
221103 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
221104 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
221105 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
221106 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus

221110 board members look forward to working alongside mr silva for many years to come the board also acknowledged the hard work and investment that mr wang dedicated to the dragons its fans and the afl over the years and wishes him the best in all his endeavors
221111 we are extremely pleased to have the boards blessing and to be able to move forward with all of our exciting plans for the dragons
221112 we are looking forward to working with the players and coach weylan harding to create a tremendous football experience for the fans
221113 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
221114 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
221115 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
221116 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone
221117 we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
221118 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
221119 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
221120 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
221121 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
221122 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
221123 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
221124 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
221125 former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
221126 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
221127 the vice presidents main effort is to mobilize the american people behind meaningful action and less talk about global warming
221128 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
221129 none of us can walk away from this issue without agreeing with him that we do have a very serious problem and its only going to get worse unless we do something about it i hope to be a part of that and i would like to see the free market take the lead not the government
221130 it pointed out that the only way we have a chance to drive down oil prices is if we become free of the slavery of oil if we can give americans choices of electrical cars or biodiesel cars then and only then do we have a chance of dealing with this cost issue that is why 4 a gallon gas is not an enemy of action its an ally of action

221308 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
221309 gw1516 activates the ppar delta protein but the mice must also exercise to show increased endurance it seems that ppar delta switches on one set of genes and exercise another and both are needed for endurance
221310 activates the ppar delta protein and mimics the effects of exercise thus switching on both sets of genes needed for the endurance signal
221311 signals the cell that it has burned off energy and needs to generate more it is pretty much pharmacological exercise
221312 its pushing your genome toward a more enhanced genetic tone that impacts metabolism and muscle function so instead of inheriting a great set point you are using a drug to move your own genetics to a more activated metabolic state

221328 we are aggressively pursuing the matter in conjunction with our members attorneys and expect that legal action will commence shortly
221329 anytime weapons are involved its better to have the people that are trained and have the equipment to execute those types of warrants
221330 the united states government has a solemn obligation to protect fully the legal rights of all united states persons including freedoms civil liberties and privacy rights guaranteed by federal law
221331 what do you have to say to folks that say essentially its nice that you have this stuff in the executive order but it doesnt necessarily mean anything when a president gets it into his mind that he needs or wants to do something that some people would find outside of those bounds
221332 i think what we would say to that is that the executive order reaffirms the nations longstanding commitment to protecting civil liberties it maintains all of the protections that are in place to do so it requires that all procedures have to be approved by the attorney general
221333 the administrations warrantless wiretapping program not only violated the foreign intelligence surveillance act it was inconsistent with several provisions of executive order 12333 the longstanding executive order governing electronic surveillance and other intelligence activities
221334 apparently the administration believed its actions constituted a tacit amendment of that executive order and who knows how many other executive orders have been secretly revoked or amended by the conduct of this administration
221335 there is no constitutional requirement for a president to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order rather than violate an executive order the president has instead modified or waived it
221336 no one disputes that a president can withdraw or revise an executive order at any time
221337 that is every presidents prerogative but abrogating a published executive order without any public notice works a secret change in the law
221338 because the published order stays on the books it actively misleads congress and the public as to what the law is
221339 if the president revokes modifies waives or suspends a published executive order or similar directive notice of this change in the law must be placed in the federal register within 30 days the notice must specify the order or the provision that has been affected whether the change is a revocation a modification a waiver or a suspension and the nature and circumstances of the change
221340 the bill does not require the publication of classified information about intelligence sources and methods or similar information the basic fact that the published law is no longer in effect however cannot be classified
221341 on rare occasions national security can justify elected officials keeping some information secret
221342 but it can never justify lying to the american people about what the law is maintaining two different sets of laws one public and one secret is just that deceiving the american people about what law applies to the governments conduct

221360 you didnt have to go very far to get an illegal carton of cigarettes for half the cost of what they would be selling at the retail level
221361 i have never been here during the dark period and this gave me an idea as to what it would be like during the twilight periods
221362 i can only compare the experience to another i had this summer when i visited ward hunt island and saw the ward hunt ice shelf for the first time
221363 it became cold and dark and suddenly it was light again
221364 what could go wrong did go wrong we couldnt make plays we bobbled snaps we couldnt hold onto the ball we just werent producing on second and long but my hats off to them eskimos
221365 it was a tough moment when we saw jason for the first time in the edmonton locker room
221366 i had to do everything i could from breaking down it was unbelievable to get the win with jason watching it was an ugly first half im glad we showed up in the second
221367 we couldnt run the football we couldnt pass the football and we couldnt make a big stop we put up enough points in the first half to win a road game
221368 it is the first time i know of that a pregnant womans body has been equated to a meth lab
221369 i hate to see a young mother put in prison away from her child
221370 but if she could be put in a treatment program with her children that would be the best course maybe we need to revisit the legislation
221371 this is an opportunity to get treatment and assistance to a mother whose addiction is so bad she has chosen to take illegal drugs while carrying a child
221372 i made the biggest mistake of my life and did some drugs with her father right before i went into labor unaware i was about to have her
221373 i get out and i have a child whos 1 its hard to adjust to being the mother
221374 i decided to get this over so she wouldnt remember
221375 if we prosecute pregnant women who use any kind of illicit substance we are opening the door to other prosecutions
221376 anybody gone into whole foods lately and see what they charge for arugula
221377 it is a strategic effort and again we assume its going to last all the way until november 4th perhaps they will give this up to distract the american people to somehow suggest that barack obama is nothing but an empty celebrity
221378 i know because i used to propose this as well
221379 the key of the house of david upon his shoulder
221380 it is a historical situation dealing with a real steward having nothing to do with a prophecy about peter or a future kingdom of christ
221381 most writers therefore seem to be agreed that the twenty fifth verse relates to shebna and that the prophet after likening eliakim to a nail fastened in a sure place tacitly applies the same comparison to shebna
221382 i would see it as a warning that the jewish kingdom economy and official offices would all fail god and they did
221383 legitimately assembled in the holy spirit constituting a general council and representing the catholic church militant it has power immediately from christ and that everyone of whatever state or dignity even papal is bound to obey it in those matters which pertain to the faith the eradication of the said schism and the general reform of the said church of god in head and members
221384 we now need to take account of the decision of a significant number of anglican bishops not to attend this lambeth conference
221385 in such a scenario who will our dialogue partner be should we and how can we appropriately and honestly engage in conversations also with those who share catholic perspectives on the points currently in dispute and who disagree with some developments within the anglican communion or particular anglican provinces
221386 were it not for romes strong insistence upon christ as the only saviour of the world upon the catholic faith the nature of the triune god the divinity of christ the importance of sacred scripture and of the objectivity of christian morality then the life of other christian churches would have been so much more difficult certainly for us here in the west
221387 among those in which catholic traditions and institutions in part continue to exist the anglican communion occupies a special place
221388 as the roman catholic church and the constituent churches of the anglican communion have sought to grow in mutual understanding and christian love they have come to recognize to value and to give thanks for a common faith in god our father in our lord jesus christ and in the holy spirit our common baptism into christ our sharing of the holy scriptures of the apostles and nicene creeds the chalcedonian definition and the teaching of the fathers our common christian inheritance for many centuries with its living traditions of liturgy theology spirituality and mission
221389 to the achievement of points of convergence and even of agreement which many would not have thought possible before the commission began its work
221390 as our dialogue has developed many catholics and anglicans have found in each other a love for christ which invites us into practical co operation and service this fellowship in the service of christ experienced by many of our communities around the world adds a further impetus to our relationship
221391 the questions and problems of our friends are also our questions and problems
221392 since this mississauga meeting however the churches of the anglican communion have entered into a period of dispute occasioned by the episcopal ordination of a person living in an openly acknowledged committed same sex relationship and the authorisation of public rites of blessing for same sex unions these matters have intensified reflection on the nature of the relationship between the churches of the communion in addition ecumenical relationships have become more complicated as proposals within the church of england have focussed attention on the issue of the ordination of women to the episcopate which is an established part of ministry in some anglican provinces
221393 quam unitatem tenere firmiter et vindicare debemus maxime episcopi qui in ecclesia praesidimus ut episcopatum quoque ipsum unum atque indivisum probemus
221394 episcopatus unus est cuius a singulis in solidum pars tenetur
221395 united and held together by the glue of the mutual cohesion of the bishops
221396 for the nurture and growth of this communion christ the lord has provided a ministry of oversight the fullness of which is entrusted to the episcopate which has the responsibility of maintaining and expressing the unity of the churches cf 33 amp 39 final report ministry and ordination by shepherding teaching and the celebration of the sacraments especially the eucharist this ministry holds believers together in the communion of the local church and in the wider communion of all the churches cf 39 this ministry of oversight has both collegial and primatial dimensions it is grounded in the life of the community and is open to the communitys participation in the discovery of gods will it is exercised so that unity and communion are expressed preserved and fostered at every level locally regionally and universally
221397 intended to assure each community that its faith is indeed the apostolic faith received and transmitted from apostolic times
221398 there are two dimensions to communion in the apostolic tradition diachronic and synchronic the process of tradition clearly entails the transmission of the gospel from one generation to another diachronic if the church is to remain united in the truth it must also entail the communion of the churches in all places in that one gospel synchronic both are necessary for the catholicity of the church 26
221399 both a voice for the local church and one through whom the local church learns from other churches
221400 the mutual interdependence of all the churches is integral to the reality of the church as god wills it to be no local church that participates in the living tradition can regard itself as self sufficient the ministry of the bishop is crucial for his ministry serves communion within and among local churches their communion with each other is expressed through the incorporation of each bishop into a college of bishops bishops are both personally and collegially at the service of the communion
221401 n otwithstanding the substantial ecclesiological issues still dividing us which will continue to need our attention this approach is fundamentally in line with the communion ecclesiology of the second vatican council the consequences which the report draws from this ecclesiological base are also constructive especially the interpretation of provincial autonomy in terms of interdependence thus subject to limits generated by the commitments of communion windsor n 79 related to this is the reports thrust towards strengthening the supra provincial authority of the archbishop of canterbury nn 109 110 and the proposal of an anglican covenant which would make explicit and forceful the loyalty and bonds of affection which govern the relationships between the churches of the communion n 118
221402 w hile the report stresses that anglican provinces have a responsibility towards each other and towards the maintenance of communion a communion rooted in the scriptures considerably little attention is given to the importance of being in communion with the faith of the church through the ages
221403 has important ecumenical ramifications since we share a common tradition of one and a half millennia this common patrimony what pope paul vi and archbishop michael ramsey called our ancient common traditions is worth being appealed to and preserved
221404 it is our overwhelming desire that the anglican communion stays together rooted in the historic faith which our dialogue and relations over four decades have led us to believe that we share to a large degree
221405 in the discussions on human sexuality within the anglican communion and between it and the catholic church stand anthropological and biblical hermeneutical questions which need to be addressed
221406 priestly ordination in the catholic church from the beginning has always been reserved to men alone
221407 this tradition has also been faithfully maintained by the oriental churches
221408 i declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the churchs faithful
221409 lead to that unity in truth for which christ prayed
221410 a restoration of complete communion of faith and sacramental life
221411 belonging to the church of christ are forces impelling toward catholic unity

221447 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
221448 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
221449 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
221450 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
221451 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
221452 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
221453 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship

221470 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
221471 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
221472 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent

221476 i used logic to write all the different parts and stuff
221477 so a lot of the instruments were things that id written on the computer id play the guitar into the computer and later when we went into the studio i was going to replay them and put them through different amps and such but i just found that the tones were so good that id gotten on logic that i said why change these

221480 ive played it for some of the band members and they all seem to be into it but you know id like to also collaborate more and see where that takes us
221481 im sorry i blamed you guys for raising the emperor
221482 all that im asking is that you please dont be oh so afraid of me
221483 noi siamo legati al pacchetto violante ci su cui si pu creare una possibile convergenza
221484 valutare il comportamento significa rafforzare nella comunit scolastica limportanza del rispetto delle regole e dunque la capacit dello studente cittadino di domani di saper stare con gli altri di esercitare correttamente i propri diritti di adempiere ai propri doveri e di rispettare le regole poste a fondamento della comunit di cui fa parte
221485 nei casi pi gravi di comportamento ha aggiunto il ministro insieme ad una valutazione caso per caso pu portate alla non iscrizione allanno successivo
221486 questo provvedimento vuole essere uno strumento ulteriore per responsabilizzare gli studenti e i docenti nelle prossime settimane ha aggiunto la gelmini continuer ad incontrare i rappresentanti delle associazioni nel mondo scolastico per continuare il confronto costruttivo avviato in questi mesi
221487 devono rimanere i crediti formativi perch non vogliamo gravare sulle famiglie semplicemente andremo a spostare linizio dellanno scolastico per fare in modo che le scuole possano organizzare meglio il recupero scolastico e poi ci sar a settembre un esame con cui verr valutato lo studente
221488 la competenza delle autonomie scolastiche ma sappiamo che molti dirigenti stanno pensando alla introduzione della divisa che un elemento di ordine ma anche di uguaglianza tra i ragazzi
221489 vi una disponibilit di alcune case di moda a cimentarsi con la divisa
221490 ma la cosa pi importante semplificare la vita alle mamme la divisa un elemento di ordine e di decoro e aumenta e rafforzare il senso di appartenenza alle singole scuole
221491 non casuale ha detto il ministro mariastella gelmini che lintroduzione della valutazione e del comportamento si affianchi allintroduzione della disciplina cittadinanza e costituzion in quanto la diffusione della cultura della cittadinanza e della conoscenza delle istituzioni tra i giovani deve essere inserita a pieno titolo nel piano delloffert formativa
221492 oggi afferma il ministro abbiamo firmato il protocollo dintesa che prevede agevolazioni culturali e connesse alla mobilit per tutti gli studenti della scuola secondaria superiore e mia volont potenziare nei prossimi mesi le agevolazioni previste estendendole anche agli studenti universitari
221493 approva il disegno di legge presentato oggi dal ministro gelmini riteniamo necessario infatti tutelare gli studenti meritevoli anche nel comportamento per questo sosteniamo la reintroduzione sulla valutazione della condotta
221494 inoltre soddisfazione sulla introduzione della disciplina cittadinanza e costituzione promossa proprio dalla nostra associazione in sede del forum delle associazioni studentesche auspichiamo quindi che il dialogo tra gli studenti ed il ministro possa continuare con profitto
221495 con il provvedimento sulla scuola adottato in cdm su proposta del ministro gelmini si raggiunge un obiettivo importante formare gli studenti ad essere cittadini
221496 infatti reintrodurre il voto di condotta pu rappresentare un primo passo per conferire allistituzione scuola quel prestigio che troppe volte mancato creando situazioni di disagio degenerate negli episodi di bullismo e violenze che spesso hanno riempito le pagine della cronaca inoltre proporre linsegnamento dell educazione civica getta le basi per una partecipazione pi consapevole e dunque libera da condizionamenti alla vita democratica ad ogni livello territoriale

221502 a waterfall however beautiful or sublime is not inherently entertaining especially if you cant ride it
221503 sublime landscapes were not simply places to be exploited but sites of spiritual uplift the pride of a nation and the birthright of its citizens such idealism would no doubt be laughed out of town today but are we really ready to dispense with the notion that our connection to a place is somehow important beyond economic impact

221507 i was also confronting a truly onerous tedium i felt possessed by the dogged futility
221508 at least one shooting a week on the street corner
221509 i dont think i can be around you any longer
221510 the briefs had a large dose of hardcore punk going on and thats pretty much not present with the cute lepers
221511 instead weve got more classic power pop and mod revival influences
221512 it takes way too long to flat iron your hair if youre a boy and people dont want to listen to somebody crying about their sad life every single song i hope heavy metal and emo people hate my band
221513 man please dont call your band that its a terrible stupid name so i just kept it
221514 im 100 percent sober i used to spend way too much time with alcohol and drugs but its been years and years since i was in that place so i know where hes coming from but im not there myself fortunately
221515 creepy harmonies and odd chord changes i think theyre bringing something fairly new to the table
221516 well we have three backup singers who smash tambourines and sing harmonies uh we have nice smiles and we have such a melting pot of influences
221517 that were very conscious of not sounding like just any other band
221518 but if it is then thats also something new were bringing to the table

221525 the ultimate goal is to find new ways to help people like the armed forces and first responders stay alert and on top of things when they have to be awake for extended periods of time we have drugs now that can keep people awake but theyre addictive and lose their effectiveness with repeated use this research should help us find methods for maintaining mental acuity that have more specific effects are less addictive and retain their potency
221526 this tests the flies mental capacity in two ways first theyve got to remember that the lighted vial is the one that has quinine in it and then theyve got to suppress their natural instinct to fly toward the light
221527 using this gene and other related genes we may be able to find better ways to boost performance for someone like a relief worker whos had to stay awake for six straight days trying to save people trapped by an earthquake i want to emphasize though that this type of treatment would just be for people who absolutely have to stay awake its not about trying to cram too many hours in your day everyone else should just suck it up and get a good nights sleep

221541 were at the point where you throw together whatever you got make the best of it and hope it goes well
221542 i was pretty excited about this one idea where some mechanical things were spinning to the music and having images projected on them it just couldnt happen though
221543 but every single note from every single part for every single instrument its just stupid but that happens to be the way that we do it it definitely causes things to take longer
221544 i didnt think of it as a faint song when i was writing it
221545 ultimately wed like to be making a completely different record every time but what ive come to realize is that even if one persons taste changes a lot you have to have all five tastes change in that same direction in order to end up with something that sounds completely different
221546 im not going to telegraph a lot of the things that im going to do because then it might compromise our ability to do so but look i know the area i have been there i know wars i know how to win wars and i know how to improve our capabilities so that we will capture osama bin laden
221547 when we got franco involved we decided to switch the roles
221548 i directed a low budget movie that played at a festival in austin and judd was there and he said i miss the funny franco then he told me he was going to be directing a comedy called
221549 i had always liked movies that werent stoner movies but had stoner characters people like spicoli in fast times at ridgemont high or the dude in the big lebowski or brad pitts character in true romance they are goofy guys but there is something more going on i read the script for this movie and i liked the role of saul and i said i think seth is going to play saul which i want to play judd said no you should play saul and seth agreed
221550 he didnt hang out much with us he was older and more mature we would order steaks and sandwiches and he ordered chicken breasts and vegetables
221551 i look at it as an engagement and a responsibility
221552 im not able to take myself off the stage and look at myself from out there i have a job to do and thats to do my best
221553 my level of commitment is great and i always want to do the best job i can possibly do i create a lot of pressure on myself but i realize a great deal is also expected of myself a lot of my friends say its difficult to be around me because i have to focus my time and energy on that
221554 my best girlfriend is coming with me and will be there to help with my daughter that makes it a lot of fun but also more work
221555 id say these days that im more confident than i have ever been in my technique and my voice and my body more confident with my singing body i would say
221556 im able to count on it like ive connected with my body i think thats happened since i had a child and found my pelvic floor and learned to feel through the ribs
221557 since the birth of my daughter i do a lot of recitals and concerts where i dont have to be away as long
221558 a recital gives you a real look at who the artist is its a very exposed medium when im doing opera im a character and i can hide behind the shield of who i am playing with these recitals its material i choose that speaks to me in some sort of way the stage is a magnifying glass they know when youre beingauthentic this medium forces you to be authentic
221559 it was my musical foundation and all the work i do comes out of that and my connection to that it has informed my music making and who i am
221560 im an individual whos always had a very deep connection with the unseen and its allowed me to be more in my heart and expose the intimacies of who i am
221561 the total number of wine trials undertaken in the development of this wine
221562 i think historically as a community were so used to being marginalized
221563 i tend to think of it as the basement mentality were used to our places of celebrations being these dark dingy bars that were once upon a time really relegated to basements and there was a lot of shame and secrecy so i think for us as a community when we hit a milestone like this its really big in a powerful way
221564 they thought oh theres no way well get people out of the bar they just didnt think thered be interest in the community to pull people away from the bars and to get them to go to an arts event and of course what weve found and i think the powerful thing over the years is there is a real interest in seeing yourself reflected on screen and being able to see a part of yourself when were so used to being missing from those stories
221565 we had almost maybe slipped under the radar with the film classification office and that was maybe a consequence of the festival gaining much more momentum in mainstream press and becoming a larger event that suddenly
221566 are often ones where the history of the community is being told by people who dont like the community very much like the police or in some cases the church theres always reading between the lines theres issues around erasure and theres issues around the way the sources are biased

221570 a terminal nexus of douchebaguousness so dark and scrotey not even tag bodyshot clouds can escape its gravitational pull
221571 i was seeing all these couples in la where all these girls were dating these uberdouchy guys
221572 i dont think people should profit off defamation of character

221574 cannot control the doucheyness of his jawline it is there from birth
221575 i would worship her used towels discarded after forty sweaty minutes on the stairmaster 2000
221576 her lightly powdered cheekbones sing harmonic twelve tone compositions performed by the kronos quartet in my pants
221577 i dont like the fact that i found out that im in a book thats being published and sold without my knowledge
221578 there should have been a lot more thought put into it louis is the biggest douchebag of them all
221579 i think 90 percent of what hes saying is right
221580 i just think he picked four or five people he shouldnt have its negative for my image half of what were hired for is how we look but he stands to gain hes making money off making fun of me
221581 he definitely didnt purchase them to my knowledge weve never even sold a picture
221582 as to the pics in the book all were purchased legally the credits in the book are accurate
221583 its part of the douchebag persona if you can take your lump get called out and then be cool about it you look so much better instantly heroic if theyre a little self deprecating it goes a long way towards redemption
221584 im gonna do a book signing next week at least im fortunate enough to have a full page and its a good pic im not really that upset about it because hey its pr
221585 quien lo va a ver eh quien lo va a ver eh
221586 he really likes it and tells me all the good points about them
221587 but he wants me to make the right decision for me and isnt pressuring me to go there
221588 i feel like i can really relate to the coaches at maryland well
221589 my parents also really like maryland its a great environment and i feel comfortable there
221590 he definitely has that mean streak in him and definitely loves the physicality of being an offensive lineman
221591 he loves to hit up until the whistle and maybe a little bit after that whistle sometimes theyre getting the type of lineman you want to have

221598 skype is providing a more intimate type of communication that would you would find on msn messenger which is a more im centric offering
221599 with skype we have instant messaging obviously but people are using us more for calling more for video in some ways you could say that we are competing with msn but we actually find that a lot of our users actually run skype alongside msn and other im programmes where they have their larger less intimate network
221600 and they have the people that they really want to talk to and really want to share these intimate experiences on their skype network
221601 we have gone for a larger ui and people are now becoming much more aware of stuff thats in there that they maybe didnt know about before
221602 theres a much bigger canvas for video and everything works together well now in one window where before you had numerous windows open which could prove confusing you can have chat and video and file photo sharing and so on all in the same window side by side you can then easily go back and find that photo that you just sent over to your mum or whatever it is so thats all in beta right now and its coming along really nicely were getting some great feedback

221608 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
221609 scam artists and internet predators often use these schemes to frighten people into paying large sums of money this is extortion and may be prosecuted

221623 to be in fashion right now means to understand the difference between feminine and female and to get the balance right too feminine and we are back in the submission of the 50s too confrontational and it becomes 80s power woman but in between these two is that wonderful space that it just 100 percent female neither overly hostile nor apologetic perhaps if hillary clinton had got this sense of female right it may have turned out differently for her

221687 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
221688 its extremely important if something happened to one of us shed always be taken care of
221689 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
221690 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
221691 same sex marriage is a social experiment and it certainly will have an impact on the culture particularly the children where we already see that in massachusetts children are being educated on the efficacy of same sex marriage and the irrelevance of fatherhood and motherhood
221692 what we can do is tend our own garden and make sure that its weeded and i think weve weeded out a discriminatory law

221727 but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
221728 that to me is freedom to allow for those who prefer open formats the ability to deliver their content without any barriers between them and their end users
221729 its such an obvious improvement over the previous state of affairs of dealing with online video that it really makes you wonder why it took so long
221730 were several years into the online video revolution now led by such giants as youtube so its only fair that we finally get native browser support for videos
221731 they interviewed 20 people and wrote brief essays about each other
221732 we interviewed the people who have inspired us with the hope that they will inspire and teach others

221734 tv networks will simply not allow steven meisels commercial to be aired its too raunchy and risque featuring eva enjoying a private intimate moment set to a seductive sound track wearing very little
221735 to be in fashion right now means to understand the difference between feminine and female and to get the balance right too feminine and we are back in the submission of the 50s too confrontational and it becomes 80s power woman but in between these two is that wonderful space that it just 100 percent female neither overly hostile nor apologetic perhaps if hillary clinton had got this sense of female right it may have turned out differently for her

221738 decizia de a scoate fostul pd din guvern si aducerea acestui partid in opozitie langa psd
221739 dupa ce am plecat din psd m au sunat multi oameni din tara le am spus ca nu voi infiinta un nou partid eu nu pot sa fiu altceva decat social democrat poate voi fi din nou in psd intr o alta formula de conducere centrala si locala in formula de azi partidul a facut atatea erori
221740 am spus ca ma retrag si ma tin de cuvant am proiecte stiintifice importante voi fi la catedra daca lucrurile se vor schimba la varful partidului pot lua in calcul o eventuala revenire
221741 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
221742 analytic outreach is the open overt and deliberate act of an ic intelligence community analyst engaging with an individual outside the ic to explore ideas and alternate perspectives gain new insights generate new knowledge or obtain new information
221743 elements of the ic should use outside experts whenever possible to contribute to critique and challenge internal products and analysis

221747 for the second time in two weeks an independent third party that rates municipal debt for the benefit of investors not the local government has determined that erie county is fiscally stable and improving
221748 this rating upgrade from an independent wall street agency once again confirms what i have been saying for the past year that the county has significantly improved its financial condition and merits an upgrade
221749 that never happened im flabbergasted by this whole thing this is the ultimate betrayal
221750 cannot use a leading to exit above the top directory
221751 its difficult because you got a lot of people who think they should go one angle with it and another angle with it as far as because who my father is
221752 you cant leave his backyard alone because we are the introduction to gangsta rap so it may scare a lot of labels and it may not it may have scared virgin so im with a good home now who believe in me and we ready
221753 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
221754 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
221755 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
221756 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
221757 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
221758 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that
221759 and were keeping our promises when bidding for the games to provide good environment and a quality service for reporters using the internet to cover the olympic games and we administer the internet by law
221760 so you can see that these terrorist groups are not that capable of instigating massive sabotage activities as some hostile forces hope to see
221761 to the beijing olympic games the biggest threat comes from the east turkistan terrorist organization
221762 these forces are trying all means to sabotage the beijing olympic games
221763 these terrorist groups are not as capable as some media organizations have claimed or broadcast
221764 our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed
221765 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
221766 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north northwest and central afghanistan
221767 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
221768 i think that whenever you have layoffs and you do that it will have an impact
221769 in the private sector we read every day stories where companies have to lay off that means there is less productivity there so we have to tighten our belt everyone has to tighten our belt
221770 while reporting this article i did everything i could to verify the trolls stories and identities but i could never be certain after all i was examining a subculture that is built on deception and delights in playing with the media
221771 starting up the same sort of racially tinged attack on mr obama that republican operatives ran against harold ford
221772 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
221773 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
221774 organics would be the home run or the grand slam of the mission
221775 we didnt really expect to find them in the surface soils
221776 just because there are organic compounds doesnt mean that thats life
221777 phoenix isnt the last gasp or msl isnt the last gasp
221778 we dont know the answer and i dont even know how to put odds on
221779 considering the slowdown in the canadian advertising market we are satisfied with the contribution made by our three business segments in the second quarter of fiscal 2008
221780 es war nur schwer weil die strecke sehr rutschig war aber das haben wir auch schon erwartet bei den reifen gab es viel graining besonders im ersten training haben die sich extrem aufgel st im zweiten ging es dann besser aber es ist dennoch schwierig die reifen zum arbeiten zu bekommen
221781 im rennen wird die strecke nat rlich besser sein sobald der grip auf der strecke da ist ist es auch einfacher die reifen am leben zu halten
221782 wir haben das im vorjahr gesehen im rennen ist das wesentlich einfacher die rundenzeiten im rennen sind dann auch sehr schnell man f hrt fast dieselben zeiten wie im qualifying
221783 ich bin wirklich begeistert es ist ein gro er unterschied ich hoffe dass es bald im auto ist zwei bis drei zehntel sollte es ausmachen
221784 der heutige tag war schwierig da sich die strecken bedingungen konstant ge ndert haben
221785 die haftung der strecke hat sich w hrend der ersten einheit verbessert und auch am nachmittag sahen wir weitere verbesserungen
221786 wie erwartet haben wir an den reifen eine menge graining gesehen und dieses war an der weicheren mischung am schlimmsten die weichere mischung erm glichte auf der strecke wie sie heute war eine etwas schnellere runde auch wenn es noch zu fr h ist um irgendwelche schl sse in bezug auf die abnutzung und den verschlei zu ziehen
221787 n op de drie geeft het ic beleid van de eigen organisatie een onvoldoende
221788 i want to thank don for his many years of dedicated and tireless service to wachovia

221794 india needs nuclear power to meet its energy needs for the 21st century this agreement is good for india good for the environment and good for advancing the shared global objectives of nuclear safety and nonproliferation
221795 this is a big step forward for india and for the international community
221796 cloud computing is fundamentally about re engineering the worlds computing infrastructure to enable game changing even life changing applications
221797 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
221798 i am delighted to hear that the iaea board of governors has decided today by consensus to approve the india specific safeguards agreement this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
221799 as we move forward towards our goal of sustainable development and energy security the peaceful uses of atomic energy will play an increasingly important role
221800 i am grateful to the members of the iaea board of governors to our partners and friends abroad and in particular to the usa for making this important step in the iaea possible
221801 i believe this agreement is good for india and good for the world and for non proliferation
221802 the agreement is good for our collective efforts to move towards a world free from nuclear weapons
221803 the agreement brings india closer to the debate of our ultimate goal nuclear non proliferation treaty for establishing a world free from nuclear weapons
221804 we cant exclude from the debate india pakistan and israel and those remaining outside the npt
221805 these are countries which hold 20 per cent of the worlds population they have to be included
221806 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
221807 it is not who recognises you in the world but how much do you have your foundations with your people
221808 i learnt a lot of politics from him he was a big force in bringing the communist party to the national mainstream
221809 he surjeet was of low formal education background but then also took on the best intellectuals of the world he was a self made fighter and even the way he died he fought till the end
221810 surjeet played a key role in making the cpi m become the single largest contingent of the communist movement not only in india but also in south asia
221811 is happy that the iaea board approved the india specific safeguards agreement through consensus
221812 india energy requirements are huge and with this india can achieve a twin objective of energy security as well as global climate concerns
221813 we are approaching all the countries and looking for a clean and unconditional waiver
221814 we welcome it we believe the agreement to be consistent with the high standards used by the iaea for safeguards
221815 the approval of india specific safeguards agreement by the international atomic energy agency iaea board of governors is a key step towards implementation of the us india civil nuclear cooperation initiative
221816 we will work vigorously with india to obtain an india specific exception in the nuclear suppliers group and the final us congressional approval
221817 we believe it will make a significant contribution to energy and climate security
221818 it also represents a gain for the non proliferation regime by bringing india further into an thereby strengthening the broader non proliferation framework
221819 will reinforce the non proliferation regime for which the european union is committed
221820 fridays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds nonproliferation regime
221821 with a blog i have the opportunity to bring my message and ideas directly to the voters it wont be focused on who has raised more money or whose leading in the polls it will be about real ideas to get state government and western new york back on the track to prosperity
221822 un saludo del presidente ch vez de la delegaci n venezolana

221826 theyre going to try to say im confused theyre going to try to say that im too angry theyre going to try to say well you know hes a north vietnamese collaborator with ptsd and hes older than all the presidents on the dollar bills but thats just because they dont want to debate me on the issues
221827 i wish they would give us some news and make us pay for the food
221828 select a much more junior attorney who lacked any experience in counterterrorism issues
221829 you will be assimilated your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own resistance is futile
221830 what i like me i like spending time with me tonight i think im going to go all the way with me
221831 our hope is to help small business people learn how social media can positively impact their efforts by taking a close look at how the obama campaign used youtube and other tools to engage millions of people
221832 the idea is simple digging deeper and showing true to life examples on how to really use social media to connect engage and develop meaningful business relationships that create profitable connections for the business owner in the end transactions dont occur without relationships social media bridges that gap
221833 i think that mcnabb is going to continue on the path that brennan set brennan more than quadrupled assets under management and he was behind the big move into exchange traded funds which has been very successful
221834 ill give you a ring when you give me back my balls
221835 its disappointing that john mccain is proud to engage in the dishonorable politics of the low road rather than talk about the serious issues the american people care about clearly mccain and his campaign dont understand that voters want to hear big ideas about the big challenges our country faces not more of the same old politics that do nothing to create jobs or provide tax relief for middle class families
221836 beijing afp china has defied calls to lift its ban on foreign visitors with hiv aids ahead of the olympics highlighting a restriction that critics say fuels prejudice against those with the disease
221837 the pickup in unemployment reduces employee bargaining power suggesting slower wage growth in the near term
221838 this should relieve some of the inflation pressure but also hinder consumers
221839 more must be done to prime the economys pump and put america back to work
221840 our economy continues to work its way through current challenges
221841 the resiliency of the economy given all the shocks we have sustained is noteworthy
221842 aujourdhui on ne pense pas que cela porte malheur ou chance cest juste naturel
221843 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
221844 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
221845 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
221846 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
221847 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
221848 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
221849 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
221850 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
221851 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
221852 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
221853 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
221854 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
221855 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
221856 there is a community of people who arent watching cnn or reading the huffington post
221857 uno de microsoft estuvo pase ndose ayer por aqu ofreci ndoles a algunos ser beta test encargados de probar programas que se encuentran en fase experimental
221858 los talleres tambi n son una oportunidad ya que est s una hora cada d a durante toda la semana con ellos por lo que ves clar simamente qui n destaca adem s stos tambi n suelen presentarse a las competiciones
221859 gente que tiene la capacidad de crear cosas y a la vez usarlas y que a la hora de hacer un producto se pregunta a s mismo
221860 no puede ser la de ir a llevarte algo sino a dar
221861 el otro d a un chico dio una charla sobre software libre en la que resolvi muy bien cuestiones que tambi n se nos plantearon a nosotros la semana que viene lo entrevistan en barcelona
221862 i dont really consider them big beefs just like people who try to knock you down but it hasnt really affected me at all
221863 no i mean cause there are still some people that are in hip hop i dont believe that its really dead at all its just that true hip hop hasnt been found in this new era
221864 i would probably make sure me and my family are set and then id later splurge like go shopping or something splurge it on bigger things after i know everything is set and is all good
221865 its just laid back its casual but like i say that im an occasion dresser the reason why is depending on where i go or where im at is how i dress
221866 everything around me has inspired me but well i would pick the 90s hip hop because thats what got me started doing this
221867 i dont know i dont really like i dont really care much about others im kinda focused on me right now
221868 there are a lot of artists that i would love to collaborate with so i dont know
221869 everyone thought i had dropped out of high school and i actually just had moved to a different school
221870 i listen to all kinds of music so i think people would be like what when they find out that i listen to classical i listen to rock i listen to all these other types of genres like bluegrass is one of my favorites
221871 theres a lot of songs let me think like a clubby song because it gets you in the mood of the whole walking in
221872 it depends on what occurred like if there was something that really bothered me then id probably fight for what i believe in like actually fight if it was something that was just really stupid id just walk away like whatever you know
221873 oh im starting my music or whatever if i get up in the industry one day would you ever collaborate with me
221874 what would the girls look like in your video my girl would kill me if i answered this laughs whats the best rumor youve heard about yourself people think im a sexaholic guilty listening pleasure i love rock music like slipknot system of a down its different i love old school rock too like poison and megadeth i mean i listen to hardcore rock people think i listen to rap all day and its like naw i listen to rock it really gets the demon out of me basically most overrated rapper lil wayne lil wayne is overrated i mean hes a good writer and all and everything like that but i just feel like theres a lot of people out there how do i say it you cant go anywhere without hearing a lil wayne song everybodys playing it it kinda gets annoying not to hate on the boy describe the hip hop scene in the valley theres a lot of gangsta rap goin on its not really like i dont wanna say that its hip hop theres a lot of gangsta rap goin on and not just gangsta rap but like goin back to the commercial type of thing like music that was basically built off of houston and philly which i dont really consider hip hop but like i said its like basically like the first thing that makes them the money a lot of people want to go with that image yknow they think its going to make money basically my style is more hip hop its close to the heart its more about just basically the complexity that you can put in there so people who just bought it they want to rewind it and they want to hear exactly what you say hip hop in the valley there are some hip hop cats like theres c styles theres people like i want to say whats his name there are several others like alex montana just a bunch of other artists out there that are real hip hop that are really into it like for the love of it and not just for what it can bring you know what i mean
221875 depicts 83 000 abu ghraib prisoner photographs equal to the number of people who have been arrested and held at us run detention facilities with no trial or other due process of law during the bush administrations war on terror
221876 im a bit sad we were hoping to finish all six victims by now were going to try and see if we can finish all six of them in those three days
221877 dammit what is she asian black white mixed what is she
221878 hello im living in south texas and barely getting by
221879 it was doing so 24 7 regardless of the amount of congestion on the network or how small the file might be
221880 indeed i have consistently opposed calls for legislation or rules to impose network neutrality
221881 like many other policy makers and members of congress i have said such legislation or rules are unnecessary because the commission already has the tools it needs to punish a bad actor
221882 a clearly stated principle of non discrimination would prove the fcc is not having a one night affair with network neutrality
221883 the non discrimination principle would also apply to wireless and wireline to assure all the freedoms of the internet to everyone
221884 i believe the agreement is good for india and good for the world
221885 we are of course approaching all friendly countries but we do hope that the nsg will similarly grant a clean unconditional exemption for india
221886 the deal is certainly important for india but its also important for the world at large because i think it meets the twin objectives of energy security as well as global climate change related issues and concerns
221887 and the concrete result of that i hope will be a comprehensive moratorium by all states that have nuclear weapons not to test them at any time in the future
221888 i will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses
221889 i will give you a new heart and a new spirit i will put within you
221890 i will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh
221891 i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules
221892 you shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and i will be your god and i will deliver you from all your uncleannesses
221893 i will put the fear of me in their hearts so they will not turn away from me

221896 he is determined focused on recruiting high quality student athletes and he sees the big picture im very excited about the direction of our swimming amp diving program
221897 when i decided to come here everything that was promised to me that has been fulfilled
221898 everything that we needed to be successful has been given to us and it is unlike support that i have been given in the past in swimming
221899 the biggest impact of having a nationally ranked recruiting class is for this next recruiting class
221900 prior to getting our team into the pool and showing result wise what we have done it is important to get the word out what kind of team we are building here and the caliber of athlete that we are looking to sign and have signed
221901 my philosophy is that you either have a work ethic in demanding excellence of yourself or do not
221902 you do not demand excellence in swimming and not in academics or vice versa its critical to find people who excel in both and are dedicated in both the discipline aspect is key in swimming
221903 the method to finding these kids is pretty similar to those you find in the
221904 we do this through reading meet results networking and coaches that we have worked with previously with our growing base of swimmers we have those we have coached that can turn us on to people and recommended us to other athletes that they know there also web sites that market these kids as well
221905 as of day one they are no longer from their countries or states
221906 they are privateers at that point and its all about building the team concept and everyone brings with them from where they are from different backgrounds that we use to our advantage the key is no matter where that place may be the student athletes are successful and highly motivated which is a common thread within our program
221907 as no vamos a ganar los juegos ol mpicos necesitamos jugar 40 minutos seguidos serios y bien
221908 i think by incorporating sports into academics it sets an example for well rounded strong leaders
221909 people learn the functions of working with a team learn values goals time management and tenacity sports integrate seamlessly with education
221910 i am an advocate of mentors and mentees because it gives young people a better chance of being successful in life and in the business world
221911 coach champion is a strong mentor to her student athletes and she believes strongly in the educational aspect of the college experience
221912 she sees sports as an avenue and stepping stone to receive an education that is valuable in creating effective leaders for the workplace education is one of the core values of our company
221913 theres a saying up her that this is a great place to raise kids
221914 we believe we have the suspect we have been looking for all night

221926 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
221927 its time for the iranians to give a serious answer
221928 they cant go and stall and make small talk about culture they have to make a decision we will see what iran does in two weeks
221929 nine long and medium range missiles including an upgraded shabab 3 capable of reaching israel
221930 few prisoners have proof of beatings and therefore cannot file a court appeal
221931 when the center of assistance for international defense started working 10 years ago no one including the inmates knew anything about the european court
221932 we distributed instructions in prisons on the form for appealing to the strasbourg court and told the inmates about the main principles of the european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms
221933 i once referred to the european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms when speaking in russias supreme court but the judge cut me short saying that i should adhere to the russian criminal code
221934 belarus has more economic and political instruments of pressure on russia and therefore will most likely buy russian natural gas at the lowest prices in the cis
221935 the other cis countries should prepare for a doubling of gas prices by 2010
221936 we will register 1 592 couples on that day whereas the usual figure is less than 1 000
221937 the festive atmosphere on such days serves as an additional impetus for trying to preserve families
221938 we have few holidays initiated by people so such events can be compared with new years celebrations or russia grabbing an unexpected place in the euro 2008 semifinals
221939 we dont expect the percent of divorces to soar above the usual number after the august 8 2008 weddings
221940 the power plant will be generating electricity and desalinating sea water
221941 la necesidad de suelo industrial es absoluta y notable y eso hemos defendido desde el psoe
221942 la necesidad de suelo industrial es absoluta y notable y eso hemos defendido desde el psoe
221943 hay que entender que no es del agrado de nadie que uno se quede sin sus tierras para una actuaci n de estas caracter sticas pero al final debe prevalecer el inter s general y la inversi n de 30 millones de euros en la construcci n del pol gono no se debe perder
221944 sus declaraciones buscan el impacto medi tico a m nadie me puede hacer acusaciones veladas de ning n tipo sin tener pruebas
221945 una vez que fueron elegidos es cuando se conocen los propietarios en este caso fue la familia marichalar pero que yo sepa no tiene ning n privilegio frente al resto de los mortales a la hora de la ubicaci n de un tema que es bueno para soria y los sorianos
221946 dont give them guns dont give them tractors dont give them jobs
221947 the enemy is raising his head with brazenness with verbal and physical violence and with offensiveness to jewish girls the enemy is making inroads into our neighborhoods and cities and we are giving them jobs
221948 it has again become clear that cheap arab labor actually costs a very dear price in blood the murderous tractors driven by arabs of eastern jerusalem are just the tip of the iceberg of a national problem that has long become an existential danger
221949 a proper jewish leadership would act with full force to deter terrorists their dispatchers and their supporters as well as to expel enemies and take all measures to end the bloodshed in the holy land
221950 but even now without a proper jewish leadership we must act on the individual level to stop supporting the arab enemy each and every one must take at least one corrective step of teshuvah repentance to strengthen jewish labor and not to support the enemies of israel
221951 as a first practical step we call for an end to hiring enemies to work in our houses an end to purchasing from enemies and not to directly employ enemies
221952 this is another clever way to masquerade airfare increases without increasing airfares
221953 thats always been our philosophy and its one that works well with us
221954 mothers came with five or six children you help out with the kids
221955 can they pay me for my youth can they pay me for my life
221956 a quarter of holocaust survivors live below the poverty level
221957 this is just a small piece of moral justice for what took place
221958 help to pay my rent to eat it will help
221959 we have a lot of people who never applied for reparations never wanted germanys money and theyre at a point in their lives where theyre ready to tell their stories
221960 der markt lag den ganzen tag ber im minus wobei die us vorgaben den markt dann zus tzlich belasteten
221961 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
221962 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
221963 these are gods children we are proud to look after her
221964 since that day we have taken care of her she is like family to us people come here for prayers and seek fulfilment of their desires but they are respectful towards her
221965 the myth of the chuhas has been exploited by beggar mafias and religious groups
221966 they roam the villages and if the real chuha is born they give them some money and they take them
221967 but what kind of saint would really curse issueless women with the blessing of deformed children
221968 some of these children the handicapped ones especially are accompanied by relatives
221969 but begging gangs also look for poor parents who will sell them because they are a burden to feed and shelter
221970 before it was taboo to even talk openly about condoms
221971 groups still oppose condom use but at least we can mention the word
221972 we are not giving needles to people who are not drug users
221973 were giving needles to people who are already using those drugs this is a way to avoid hiv infections
221974 even my staff encounter problems with them we have the endorsement of the narcotics authorities and we give needles not drugs
221975 so if they catch our clients with drugs we cant stop them but you cant catch those with just needles
221976 we have our outreach workers getting arrested they authorities raid and catch everyone we are forever trying to bail out our outreach workers from the lockup which is a major headache on a day to day basis
221977 infections are going up but surveillance is very poor in malaysia
221978 many young msm only know of their illness for the first time when they are warded with aids how long have they been positive how long have they been infectious it is critical
221979 have wives drug users patronize sex workers they buy sex they sell sex
221980 i dont think they have evidence that a universal testing strategy is going to lead to lower infection rates and less hiv
221981 there are some indications to be optimistic but optimism and promise arent proof
221982 some doctors are still making irrational decisions about hiv testing deciding whether to screen someone based on what he or she looks like baker said adding
221983 its a real paradox when one big federal agency makes a recommendation that another big federal agency wont support john bartlett a johns hopkins university physician said
221984 i think theyve got to catch up its a disease thats lethal and one of the major problems with hiv today is late entry into care
221985 unlawfully extended its monopoly position as the sole provider of norvir
221986 the price adjustment of norvir was a legitimate response to advances that abbott scientists made in treating hiv and captured the fair value of its new use as a bolster
221987 justifiably proud of his administrations leadership in ramping up its commitments to the global efforts to control aids over the past five years and in proposing to do more in the next five
221988 only hitch is whether the money will actually materialize in the form of appropriations
221989 implies appropriations of roughly 9 billion to 10 billion a year
221990 but advocacy groups say the amounts emerging from congressional appropriations committees for fiscal year 2009 will be little more than half of that
221991 come up with a startling insight into the aids epidemic in this country by contrasting it with the global epidemic
221992 shown the same zeal to control this domestic tragedy that it has shown in the global campaign
221993 surely we should be doing as much to prevent the spread of the aids virus in our own communities as we are trying to do abroad
221994 saving literally millions of lives and it will stand as bushs greatest bipartisan foreign policy achievement
221995 less than six months remaining in the bush presidency the rest of his legacy remains at best cloudy
221996 but the impressive results of his battle against the scourge of aids cannot be denied its impact in real lives saved will be felt for many years to come
221997 sets a goal of treating more than the two million patient target set in 2003 but how much more isnt clear
221998 with this funding we will support treatment for at least three million people
221999 fail to see aids treatment for what it is a stop gap measure to tide humanity over until we can collectively reach what ought to be our real goal stopping hivs spread entirely
222000 individual basis living with aids is a proper goal on a population basis it is catastrophic
222001 viewed as an interim step its funding and expansion make sense not only morally but also as a practical matter of economics and foreign policy
222002 b ut only if a massive commitment to finding searches for both a vaccine and cure for hiv are sustained for years to come
222003 have been linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer
222004 drinking organic milk may cut risk of heart disease and cancer
222005 increased intakes of ala may increase the risk of advanced prostate cancer
222006 none of the studies found a significant reduction in body weight and only two studies showed a significant but relatively small body fat lowering effect
222007 my wife wants to go move to eretz israel but im not so sure about it what does kvod harav recommend
222008 as long as we are living in america i should continue to give chizuk to american jews
222009 i will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go i will counsel you and watch over you
222010 i might go back and fight for my country myself
222011 this was a tumultuous period for mr gould beginning with his swift rise from the broadway minor leagues to the studio a list a vanguard figure of what the critic j hoberman has called hollywoods jew wave the leading man as schlemiel
222012 in a 1970 cover story profile time magazine branded elliot gould the standard bearer for the western worlds hung up generation dated jargon notwithstanding for the first half of the 1970s the actor did indeed personify the nixon era antihero in all its three dimensionally neurotic glory
222013 all of these movies have aged well and all of them pretty much flopped back in the shag carpet days
222014 hes the perfect performer for an era at once drunk on and hung over from possibility
222015 i mean his early 70s heyday and maybe now too

222030 rip tim mclean you are loved and you will be missed dearly that man will pay for what he did we love you
222031 cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
222032 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
222033 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
222034 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
222035 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
222036 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
222037 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision
222038 well it depends its important to know when you have a agenda with a hypothesis you are open to learning that its true that its partially true or that its wrong with an agenda you have an investment with proving that you are right

222046 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance
222047 as kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
222048 the ecb have written to the organisers confirming that subject to contract the board has approved the participation of middlesex the twenty20 cup winners on the proviso that the event is authorised and on agreed terms
222049 ecb has requested and is awaiting confirmation of the regulations for this event from the organisers
222050 we are extremely happy to have middlesex on board this makes the tournament complete in every manner
222051 i was amazed i never had a change of venue in any of those situations
222052 youll be amazed at how many people will say i never heard of that
222053 the media coverage has been going on for 20 something years
222054 when you consider the full nature of media coverage its hard for us to see how mr house has been harmed by publicity
222055 the evidence shows mr house can receive a fair trial in union county
222056 compared to no provision for the comparable period in 2007
222057 nonperforming assets totaled 768 000 or 0 23 percent of total assets at june 30 2008 compared to 526 000 or 0 15 percent of total assets at june 30 2007 the increase in nonperforming assets was due to increases in both foreclosed real estate and nonperforming loans
222058 we are pleased to report solid core financial results for the quarter and fiscal year given a challenging operating environment and competitive pressures

222061 truly i dont think were going to have 100 percent of workers in the center
222062 there will always be some people who dont want to follow the rules
222063 we need to educate not just day laborers but also employers that takes time
222064 as soon as we have more jobs here we will have more workers coming
222065 a day laborer hire site offers a number of solutions to all those affected small businesses benefit from no longer having workers congregate on streets or impede business traffic
222066 the whole idea of the grant was to eliminate those two spots it was not to make a third
222067 i drive by these places every day and ive seen no change in the number of guys out there
222068 from the very beginning its very important to not have the expectation that hiring sites get everybody off the street that has never happened anywhere
222069 a center should never be measured by whether it gets people off the street its a safe alternative for people who choose to use it

222073 we are pleased to expand flip4mac support into final cut pro for the new generation of 360 systems maxx servers
222074 final cut users can now pull content directly from their image server into final cut pro edit it and move it back to the server for playout enabling a faster file based workflow for imx content
222075 this tight integration is key to providing a faster more convenient workflow for transferring media between our servers and final cut pro editing environments
222076 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
222077 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
222078 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
222079 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
222080 but under the laws that govern cleanup the navy is also required to implement practical historic preservation measures
222081 that comparison makes it easy for navy officials to recommend to their bosses stripping and coating over the demolition but it leaves historic mitigation unresolved
222082 a great example of how a community can work together to save a historic landmark

222085 gasoline seems to leading the energy complex today its the strongest thing out there
222086 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range

222088 we are putting out a national call for pro lifers to come to wichita especially during the november 17 hearing later this year and the trial which is set to begin on march 16 of next year
222089 as christians we believe in the power of prayer and in the biblical mandate to expose the sinful act of abortion we plan to do both as court proceedings against tiller begin
222090 we intend to keep attention focused on these proceedings to keep the system honest to unsure that justice will be done there has been far too much political interference and obstruction of other efforts to hold tiller accountable for crimes we know he has committed to allow the same kind of corruption to derail this prosecution
222091 everyone involved in this case needs to know that the eyes of the nation are on them
222092 the respect and reverence extreme brings to the music that it loves is part of the groups ongoing charm
222093 kicked off their international tour with what might have been a perfect concert wednesday at neumos on capitol hill

222106 i was very excited to break the record because it was my senior year and it was a great year for me and for the team because we won the mac regular season and the mac tournament
222107 id say she had the most talent of these three players saruta and jeanmaire
222108 she was quick and had weapons with a huge forehand and good volleys
222109 she was a great competitor and would never give up
222110 she was very smart and could figure out how best to attack and win the match
222111 it was a very large step for a thai woman to come to this country
222112 for males it wasnt such a big deal but it was a different story for a female on top of that she had a tremendous language barrier i think that is one of the most difficult parts for asian players more so than europeans or south americans
222113 she played in the public parks which is near and dear to my heart because it shows a blue collar hard working mentality
222114 the first time i saw carrie play was against future teammate and doubles partner malena remynse at the junior wightman cup
222115 was she going to get to that next level in tennis probably not but she made the most out of what she had
222116 everybody works hard but she is just a very great fighter and competitor
222117 carrie always took the court with an aggressive game plan
222118 when she stepped on the court she never gave up and that made her such a tough person to play against
222119 she made a jump in her game every year because she took it on herself to be better at something
222120 after her freshman year where she lost the deciding match in the mac tournament i told everyone to take a week off and she didnt take a day off she was continually trying to find ways to get better and she just loved tennis
222121 i think the coaching and being around such a great team helped make me a better player
222122 theres no question that hard work was the key for her
222123 nobody has made the most out of what they have more than she has she doesnt physically have the attributes that a lot of players have and its tough for her out there she just had determination that was greater than most people she never wasted a moment i know that
222124 i think a lot of people think i dont hit the ball hard or have a big serve and i hate to lose to those people because thats not what tennis is about
222125 every time before i play my mind set is to play a long match because thats how i play well it was hard for me to realize that was my kind of tennis because it is very hard and tiring but assistant coach ryan tomlinson told me that was my tennis and that is what im good at
222126 she doesnt make many mistakes and she is also very fast she may look calm and not aggressive but she is very competitive underneath
222127 she is always rough on herself but she is a fighter and fights through it even though shes calm and cool on the court
222128 she did a lot of her losing in the fall but in the spring she was just stellar she was unbelievable
222129 when i first came here i didnt understand what teachers were saying sometimes i didnt know i had homework
222130 i think i worked hard i studied a lot at home and spent a lot more time on schoolwork than other people because i would take twice the time to read
222131 im more proud that i did well in both i think doing well in one and not doing well in the other is still good but for me its more important to do well in both because thats really hard to do
222132 we had great coaches and a great program at wmu
222133 all of us had different strengths and weaknesses that we used to help each other get better every day that made us successful players and a successful team
222134 practices were great when all of those players were around all of them competed so hard
222135 we just had a group of people who competed like crazy but were still friends off the court that was the key to getting better no question about it

222139 i have a hard time using my credit cards for personal items because clerks will accuse me of using a business card i cannot tell my name to someone without having to explain it some days it is exhausting and i cant even disguise the annoyance in my voice
222140 i still give my mother a hard time about the name choice and she tries to explain that she was young she liked how it sounded it was 1970 and various other reasons
222141 i actually tried going by another name for a year and i realized that as much as i truly hate my name it is embedded in me and so much a part of my experience
222142 at times for the sake of avoiding an uncomfortable conversation or throwing someone off guard i answer to the names of mary or kelly
222143 the thought of putting an employee through the pain of guessing how to spell and pronounce bluzette just isnt worth it to me

222153 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
222154 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
222155 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
222156 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
222157 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
222158 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin

222348 what may be known about god is plain to them because god has made it plain to them for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse for although they knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened
222349 do not be deceived god cannot be mocked a man reaps what he sows the one who sows to please his sinful nature from that nature will reap destruction the one who sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life

222388 we welcome it we believe the agreement to be consistent with the high standards used by the iaea for safeguards
222389 the approval today of india specific safeguards agreement by the international atomic energy agency iaea board of governors is a key step towards implementation of the us india civil nuclear cooperation initiative
222390 we will work vigorously with india to obtain an india specific exception in the nuclear suppliers group and the final us congressional approval
222391 we believe it will make a significant contribution to energy and climate security
222392 deeply appreciative of the historic significance of the milestone in our cooperation with the iaea and the international community in peaceful uses of atomic energy
222393 as we move forward towards our goal of sustainable development and energy security the peaceful uses of atomic energy will play an increasingly important role

222400 i am just going to go home and enjoy the season for what it was
222401 i need to assess the situation and decide whether i want to move forward or not and do this
222402 this years schedule is another good test for an experienced squad
222403 in particular we have a pair of tough road games against big east squads pitt is an improving team and georgetown was in the leagues top four last year and went to the ncaas playing them on the road will provide us a great opportunity to see where we are before heading in to the ivy games
222404 our schedule this year is regionally based so we can solidify our position in our region
222405 in addition to georgetown and villanova who finished ahead of us in the region last year we also play richmond and pitt on the road outside of ivy play those matches will really test our mettle early this fall
222406 the ivies are always challenging and we know that coming into the year
222407 we need to be fully prepared when september 27 rolls around
222408 it was informal and allowed all of us with penn ties to reflect on how the program has changed over the years we had a round table discussion on everything penn from maestro csiszar to the current success we have been having
222409 i think the best part of that dvd was video from maestro csiszar giving me a lesson when he was 91 years old
222410 what a tremendous feeling it was to be up there surrounded by my family and dear friends
222411 i had some notes which helped keep me on track i think the highlight was the personal reflections that gave people insight into my career and ambitions

222458 we cant tell you just how proud we are to be on the same continent madam president you are building what has been broken and we have a lot to learn from you
222459 looking back we didnt pay enough attention to rebuilding our social fabric we can learn from liberia to make every young person feel valued and needed
222460 i think this is a great way of celebrating a great mans birthday and redefining what african leadership should be it need not be about control its about inspiration
222461 thank you mama president for the opportunity to bring these girls together
222462 we still think that in order to be what we are we have to be defined by men but we have the power to make ourselves what we want to be
222463 im calling on these women as some of the top businesswomen and brains in south africa and asking what kind of government are we going to have in 2009
222464 when she triumphed it was a true moment of glory south africa sent a large delegation to her inauguration
222465 we need to make sure those who aspire to office those who inspire us are supported there are great things we can do together
222466 our independence as women has to be realized through economic development and economic empowerment
222467 for me what was special was the cohesion the strength the inner core of women coming together and reiterating their commitment to the continent and knowing we have so much in common the commitment is continuing
222468 it was an amazing opportunity to meet with such iconic women from the continent it came across again and again that even though they are so important they kept reminding us how we needed to stay in touch with grassroots women we need to go away with a sense of respect and balance
222469 it was truly inspirational i admire most of the women in the room today it is a privilege to be here with so many all bought together it is truly empowering to hear these speeches
222470 it was fantastic we as women tend not to celebrate ourselves or support each other but today we came together despite our differences because we are women we carry the torch and sometimes the light only shines on one of us but if we are holding hands then we can make a real difference in our lives
222471 it is wonderful to be here with such dynamic women the challenge is in the translation of what has been said it is the same challenge facing the foundation how do we continue this legacy beyond the man i think we need to keep talking and make a commitment to recreating the village and revisiting the indigenous knowledge
222472 it was very inspirational i have been feeling very down about exams and this has helped me to be strong
222473 how very pleased i am to be here to be part of nelson mandelas 90th birthday celebrations
222474 so many women in liberia have played such important roles especially in attaining peace once peace was restored women decided that the time had come for women leadership it was now their time
222475 what we did do was say well put women in charge at strategic places well put them in charge of the money
222476 it is an awesome responsibility one takes courage when one sees that there are so many people who give their support when you move up the ladder of success it picks up a momentum of its own

222511 the essence of the liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held but in how they are held instead of being held dogmatically they are held tentatively and with a consciousness that new evidence may at any moment lead to their abandonment

222516 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
222517 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
222518 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
222519 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
222520 since that deal was struck claims payouts have fallen sharply sparking debate over whether a malpractice crisis ever existed
222521 i was going to be accompanied by one of my advisers a former military officer and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasnt on the senate staff
222522 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance as kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
222523 the ecb have written to the organisers confirming that subject to contract the board has approved the participation of middlesex the twenty20 cup winners on the proviso that the event is authorised and on agreed terms
222524 there is an issue over whether it is an officially sanctioned event but we hope it can be resolved
222525 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck

222530 the national wetland inventory did not show these as wetlands
222531 department of state lands relied on national resource conservation service soil maps to make their determination that wetlands were present
222532 wetland delineation prepared by a consultant and approved by dsl identified the monmouth wetland boundaries
222533 there were no real alternative locations suitable for the substation so there was an unavoidable loss of 0 3 acre of wetland this wetland loss was offset by the purchase of 0 3 credits from the mud slough mitigation bank near rickreall
222534 we have a new wetland delineation report in for review at gwinn st village
222535 we received the report on july 9 and the review is still pending
222536 these are large important sectors of greenhouse gas emissions from the united states
222537 and they are emissions that can be controlled and as yet are entirely unregulated by epa
222538 epa has been responsive to the petition and we will continue to move forward in the regulating process
222539 these states would find it more beneficial to spend their time lobbying members of congress to pass responsible environmental legislation
222540 here in oregon we are ready to take the necessary steps to protect our planet from global warming but the federal government continues to sidestep the issue with red tape and bureaucratic delay
222541 yet again the bush administration epa is ignoring its duty to combat pollution if we are serious about fighting climate change we must limit emissions from our transportation and commercial sectors

222548 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association betweenall cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
222549 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large
222550 in our particular study a sixfold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
222551 our findings remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
222552 people who have or suspect that they have sleep apnea should consult their physicians about diagnosis and treatment options
222553 this australian data has additional strengths in that it is a population based prospective sample with a long period of follow up
222554 further work is needed to see if mild obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse effects and if continuous positive airway pressure treatment reduces cardiovascular risk in larger populations
222555 our findings of significant mortality risk with untreated sleep disordered breathing in conjunction with prior evidence that continuous positive airway pressure can effectively treat severe sleep disordered breathing underscore the immediate need for heightened clinical recognition and treatment of sleep disordered breathing

222561 it is a race against time and time is winning
222562 most historians who write on the events and the times in which connolly was active do so without reference to his activities or those of the left in general this is because these historians proceed from conservative standpoints for the most part and are largely uninterested in the contribution made to irish history by those of a more revolutionary outlook this in turn brings into serious question the history they write and the conclusions that they reach an examination of connollys career assists those historians who wish to challenge these conservative interpretations because it illuminates the thread of radicalism that runs throughout twentieth century irish social and political history and in so doing alters appreciably the latters overall appearance

222564 we understand your concerns and we share them but that is not our intent
222565 we do recognize the charter school provides challenges for rocklin unified in oversight and facilities but it offers another chance for rocklin academy to work together with rocklin unified
222566 it concerns me a little bit that you have come before us with the same petition packaged a little differently
222567 this has nothing to do with one school being better than another
222568 the goal is to move forward with action on every campus and my concern with a magnet school is that fewer people are involved
222569 its easier when you have the label of a charter or magnet school and its harder to bring students back when youre discussing a whole new concept of teaching
222570 im very pleased that we are doing this and i think its a great idea
222571 it works for chad and hes learning a lot more his behavior has changed hes just 100 percent a way better student
222572 they helped me tremendously to get me where i am in my career
222573 the quality was great if i had any questions my teacher was happy to help me
222574 chad is getting the extra help that he needs and the work is being checked
222575 he knows that when we meet he has to have his work completed and im going to ask questions
222576 looking into the future she wouldnt have graduated continuing the way she was going
222577 hes doing something were training 45 year olds to do this kid is doing it within a week
222578 for us it really helps us to reach out to students

222580 if i would have learned english and math in high school

222586 we must not forget that there is a war on and our troops are in the thick of it
222587 the whole purpose in the shifts that are being made is to provide an opportunity for everyone to continue to move forward
222588 they already have a very solid team there and bob metz will help them to move forward
222589 there are going to be casualties and thats just the way the world works
222590 its still about the kids who had their scores canceled theyre the real casualties

222636 in the 21st century white america got a wake up call after 9 11 01 white america and the western world came to realize that people of color had not gone away faded into the woodwork or just disappeared as the great white west kept on its merry way of ignoring black concerns
222637 liberation theology in nicaragua in the was a pro sandinista pro marxist anti u s anti catholic church movement thats it no ifs ands or buts his church apparently supported in the mid 80s in nicaragua groups that supported the sandinista dictatorships and that were opposed to the contras whose reason for being was calling for elections thats all i know i was there i saw the churches in nicaragua that he spoke of and the churches were churches that talked about the need for violent revolution and i remember clearly one of the major churches in managua where the jesus christ on the altar was not jesus christ he was a sandinista soldier and the priests talked about the corruption of the west talked about the need for revolution everywhere and talked about the evil empire which was the united states of america
222638 its based in marxism at the core of his wrights theology is really an anti christian understanding of god and as part of a long history of individuals who actually advocate using violence in overthrowing those they perceive to be oppressing them even acts of murder have been defended by followers of liberation theology thats very very dangerous

222641 black theology refuses to accept a god who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community if god is not for us and against white people then he is a murderer and we had better kill him the task of black theology is to kill gods who do not belong to the black community black theology will accept only the love of god which participates in the destruction of the white enemy what we need is the divine love as expressed in black power which is the power of black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal unless god is participating in this holy activity we must reject his love

222645 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed

223056 epas financial support gives charleston county the opportunity to expand our environmental education efforts throughout the community we applaud epa for their assistance in this important environmental education effort which will help us meet the ultimate goal of enhancing the areas environmental quality
223057 we are pleased and honored to have been selected by the epa to become a care community
223058 we are undertaking an extensive educational campaign with this program to provide information and assistance to our citizens on ways to reduce pollution and improve our air and water quality in order to protect the environment for future generations
223059 the desert rock power plant will be one of the cleanest pulverized coal burning power plants in the country
223060 exporters of computer monitors must submit formal notification to the epa prior to shipping overseas
223061 the required notice and consent of the receiving country helps ensure that crts are recycled in an environmentally sound manner
223062 copper has gone up so much at the scrapyards that thieves are getting brazen when stealing these materials
223063 but what they do not realize is how it affects the people at the buildings they are stealing from
223064 this research going on at rutgers will give us some very valuable insight into how to combat the west nile virus at its source
223065 by better understanding the relationship between the wetlands environment and virus rates we can lower our risk of falling prey to these life threatening pests
223066 rutgers is pleased that the u s epa is enabling our scientists to investigate factors affecting the transmission of west nile virus
223067 through a better understanding of its causes we hope to reduce the prevalence of the disease
223068 she gave me her number but since it was all sevens i couldnt remember it
223069 you sneaky bastards youre manipulating the dumb and malleable unwashed masses that should legitimately be mine
223070 we are holding the credit rating agencies accountable for a secret wall street tax on main street millions of dollars illegally exacted from connecticut taxpayers
223071 connecticuts cities and school districts have been forced to spend millions of dollars unconscionably and unnecessarily on bond insurance premiums and higher interest rates as a result of deceptive and deflated credit ratings
223072 studies done by all three agencies themselves since 1999 show that public bonds default far less often than corporate bonds with similar higher credit ratings
223073 this rating charade created a wall street shell game constructed by the ratings agencies for the benefit of the bond insurers which enabled the bond insurers to profit from unnecessary premiums and interest paid by taxpayers
223074 i think there is clearly a mismatch between the default data and peoples perception of the risk associated with municipal credits
223075 the credit rating agencies and bond insurers have enjoyed enormous profits at the expense of taxpayers as a result of this deceptive dual rating system
223076 todays action has highly significant national implications for taxpayers across the country which is why i have been contacting colleagues in other states
223077 did we know this was coming at first blush this looks pretty serious to me this is cutting at the heart of our industry while we in the industry might agree with the default loss conclusion this is in part the basis of our success and ability to leverage as high as we are to lay it out there like this could be very detrimental
223078 we know that hardly anybody reads the moodys special reports so it didnt matter
223079 im extremely pleased that cardozo has opened its arms to pubpat and offered us a home from which we can base and expand our public service work
223080 pubpats work to improve the patent system through patent office proceedings gives students great clinical training while serving the public good
223081 our final approval acknowledges idahos achievement in involving stakeholders throughout the development of the burn program
223082 in the states submission ideq focused on the protection of public health and public notification these efforts lay the groundwork for success
223083 projected job income and gross state product growth as well as business openings closings and venture capital investments
223084 there is no split between the spiritual and material life
223085 one of our saints symeon the new theologian poetically writes that god enters our hands and feet so that we might become his body working in the world
223086 having a certified team ready to help their brothers and sisters on campus or in the neighborhood in the event of either a small emergency or a major disaster is crucial to our common well being
223087 this is a way to reach out to the people of yonkers
223088 and to understand the watershed in which we live the data we collect will begin to effect changes and our ultimate hope is for cleaner streams running into the bronx river and eventually into long island sound
223089 nyserda literature informs us that the largest controllable budget category in a school is typically energy related
223090 and our seminary has taken that statistic to heart thus in november and december 2007 we invested in complete energy audits for nine campus buildings and in turn received detailed analyses and reports on these structures from nyserda with each report including energy cost reduction opportunities which our board of trustees is reviewing and some of which we are in the process of implementing
223091 implementation of energy saving measures would further allow us to demonstrate environmentally sound practices tied to our theological vision of stewardship while giving us the capacity to pursue our core mission of educating theological students for service to their local parishes and communities and to the world
223092 i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality
223093 when we talk about pushing a tests limit of detection or lod were referring to the signal to noise ratio
223094 its really a matter of figuring out how to reduce the background noise and make the signal stand above the noise
223095 we identified a location that has the maximal signal to noise ratio
223096 by focusing on this signal rich point of light we extended the lod by two orders of magnitude
223097 about 90 percent of our time was spent in sample preparation not actually performing the assay
223098 with further integration and automation of the test the time could be reduced significantly
223099 the optical sensor requires a more expensive set up because of the confocal microscope
223100 so in a small dental or doctors office the electrochemical sensor generally would be easier and cheaper to use but to really push down the signal to noise ratio the optical sensor has the advantage
223101 but the technology is advancing so rapidly its difficult to predict how the optical sensor might be used in the years to come
223102 at this point it has certainly pushed the envelope for the limit of detection and this will be an important capability in advancing salivary diagnostics
223103 recent evidence suggests that in many cases tumor cells have already seeded metastatic sites even when the primary tumor is diagnosed at an early stage
223104 we hope that with additional studies we can begin to discover new ways to therapeutically keep the dormant to active switch in the off position thus limiting the chance that micrometastases become active in later life
223105 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids thats been violated and we dont know why
223106 this is a close knit community this is obviously a shock to everybody
223107 this is where people come to relax and get away from craziness
223108 the decision will reap the former dallas mavericks coach 6
223109 wii 2 might not bring as many new ideas to the table as we had previously thought
223110 the decision will reap the former dallas mavericks coach 6
223111 this was a very good performance i am not dissatisfied with anything
223112 i think we played really well tonight because we had so much respect for lithuania who i think can be a medal winner in beijing
223113 mit diesem schritt nimmt der parteivorstand sein recht wahr das interesse der gesamtpartei zu vertreten
223114 mir ist aber wichtig dass in einer gesamtbetrachtung sowohl pers nliches verhalten als auch die politische lebensleistung in die beurteilung einbezogen werden
223115 die engere parteif hrung kann und wird dem urteil der bundesschiedskommission nicht vorgreifen
223116 wolfgang clement hat durch sein politisches lebenswerk erhebliche und beachtenswerte leistungen und beitr ge erbracht und sich damit um die spd verdient gemacht ich w nsche mir dass er dies auch k nftig als mitglied der spd aus ihr heraus wird leisten k nnen
223117 es hat doch ohnehin seit monaten niemand mehr geglaubt dass wolfgang clement spd mitglied ist da w rde es auch keinen berraschen wenn er es nicht mehr ist wer sich so unsolidarisch verh lt muss mit einer solchen entscheidung rechnen
223118 der wirklich der hessischen spd in den r cken gefallen ist
223119 die aufregung um seinen m glichen parteiausschluss schadet eher der spd
223120 die vom unabh ngigen whereabout missed test gremium getroffenen entscheidungen sind sowohl f r die betroffenen sportler wie auch deren klubs hart der nada code l sst alternativen jedoch nicht zu ungeachtet der zu sanktionierenden meldepflichtverst e bin ich davon berzeugt dass die betroffenen sportler ohne wenn und aber gegen doping sind und sich keinerlei unerlaubten mitteln bedienen
223121 wir werden uns jetzt einen anwalt nehmen und sehen was wir machen k nnen
223122 hier wurde von einigen spielern nicht immer die gr tm gliche sorgfalt an den tag gelegt
223123 wenn der fall busch nicht gewesen w re w re es gar nicht so weit gekommen
223124 wir haben jetzt alles auf den weg gebracht was die nada und das bmi zurecht gefordert hatten
223125 a year from now we may all be saying how on earth could they have given up on manny and a good player like moss and a good young reliever like hansen for jason bay but that just goes to show you how dire the situation with ramirez had become before the sox shipped him to the dodgers at the trade deadline today
223126 as much as ramirez was a pain in the pillows as much as he caused angst and disgust you cant help but get the feeling that the red sox ultimately caved in here ramirez got what he wanted
223127 a guy who occasionally swings like babe ruth and is consistently as nutty as a baby ruth
223128 indeed other than the red soxs terry francona probably the only other current major league manager who can handle ramirez is torre who constantly dealt with wacky late season acquisitions with the new york yankees
223129 colletti pulled this off without giving up on any of the dodgers major prospects and did we mention the red sox are paying ramirez his remaining 7 million
223130 its like colletti announcing hes going to produce a movie and will smith calling to say he wants to be in it for free
223131 the way i see it losing a lot the rest of this season and all of next would be a blessing in the form of higher first round picks and if fewer people come to the ballpark how exactly would you be able to tell
223132 nothing is guaranteed of course huntington might prove every bit as unskilled as his predecessors owner bob nutting might never spend enough money to field a legitimate contender but im willing to give this thing a chance at least theres a plan
223133 pirates management in its various incarnations has been writing this script for 16 years an evident narrative arc to nowhere
223134 characters come and go none fully developed and they are replaced by others far less developed and if you were chilled by chapter 2008 wait until you see chapter 2009
223135 judge it by dollars or by sense this trade had no major obstacles except that the marlins werent committed to making it happen
223136 cant see why not especially with the marlins trying to crush a stadium stopping lawsuit with proof of south floridas need for them if the whole affair was a pr stunt meant to give the appearance of a franchise willing to do anything to reach the world series again it clearly backfired florida fans are tired of being teased
223137 i give the marlins credit for what apparently was a very serious effort to make a very significant deal aimed solely at this pennant race and the 2008 postseason
223138 this isnt your normal collection of ballplayers wearing the black and white
223139 they are not in other words going to win another world series this year
223140 the sox remain a big plodding muscular team that hits for power joe crede when he returns but has trouble manufacturing runs any other way theyd be great in home run derby a recipe for glory it is not
223141 ken griffey jr in center field at the cell a cause to rejoice set off the fireworks
223142 if you can get a guy who has more home runs than frank robinson mark mcgwire harmon killebrew reggie jackson mike schmidt mickey mantle ernie banks and lou gehrig hallelujah and amen
223143 in hindsight he never fit griffey never embraced cincinnati cincinnati didnt give him much of a chance
223144 this isnt a great town for superstars we dont cater well in that respect griffey was always too big a presence he wanted room service we pointed to the drive through
223145 it is a sad time in cincinnati but perhaps it is the dawn of the gm walt jocketty era he was brought in as general manager to turn around seven straight years of losing
223146 trading griffey to the chicago white sox is the beginning younger players are the future not a 38 year old outfielder whose skills are eroding fast due to age and enough injuries to use as a living model for a medical school
223147 die beachvolleyballer k nnen ihr ausweichquartier am rande von peking beziehen
223148 hochwertige ausstattung der zimmer viel wasser und gr n zwischen den h usern und eine variantenreiche verpflegung da haben sich die chinesen viel m he gegeben
223149 he sets the table for everything that they do and they must have him in the fold to have any chance of succeeding this season
223150 there are definitely some similarities with jacksons current situation and larry johnsons circumstances a year ago
223151 both were entering the last year of their rookie contracts and had outperformed those original deals from a production standpoint as the focal point of their respective offenses they were in a position to hold the team hostage due to their value
223152 as one of the top three backs in the game he should be rewarded for the kind of production that he has and will continue to put up for them everyone else is taking a bite of the apple so it shouldnt come as a surprise that he wants to take his turn
223153 he will respond to their structured environment plus he is going to play with a chip on his shoulder after being let go in oakland
223154 he doesnt want to carry the load he works best when he has 15 or so carries and five or six receptions
223155 people forget that he was in the top five in rushing last season before his injury the biggest question regarding him is whether he can stay healthy
223156 but the unit as a whole is inexperienced and you wonder if their guys are tough enough to play a smash mouth style of game
223157 he has all of the tools to be an outstanding player
223158 but you wonder if he has the mindset and work ethic to make it happen
223159 our customers and prospects have asked for a parallel development change management solution that complements saps solution manager
223160 newmerix sync solves the issues related to managing and synchronizing transports between multiple development source systems by providing the visibility and control they require
223161 it is wonderful to put your mind to something and see it through from the beginning i saw myself winning this contest i made the decision and then followed through with consistent efforts in the first three weeks i had a slow start and that is usually when i lose momentum and focus but this time i kept going
223162 i broke down all the information on p1d and presented it to my prospects in small doses as needed until they were ready to make the decision to join my business
223163 by seeing this process through each and every time i was getting more people saying yes
223164 i attribute my success to doing the same things consistently over and over again things i dont do anymore are watching tv or listening to the radio in my car instead ill listen to an inspirational or skill enhancing cd
223165 connecting with family having fun sharing in each others happiness smiles and laughter is what living is to me
223166 p1d recognizes the importance of incentives and promotions to create momentum within the team and you will see more of these types promotions in the future
223167 the smg 90 day action plan if followed means anyone can achieve the same results as melissa adams this is an equal opportunity business with p1d nettrav com and smg all the components are in place and earning a six figure income an absolutely attainable goal for all our members
223168 what separates poetry from religious dogma is the ability of a poem to speak across time to everyone no matter their world view

223174 if all conservatives were like you id have no problem with them
223175 thats ridiculous what are you french or something i am very attractive and very smart you are a communist
223176 every company that has already released a 790i board isnt pulling it
223177 youll have to talk to foxconn to get the details of their specific case but i doubt its just a chipset issue
223178 if we are going to pull our 790i board i have received no confirmation from hq as far as im concerned the 790i is still on the roadmap
223179 we have a 790i board called the p7n2 diamond out at the moment and it has no reported issues
223180 as one of the first companies to obtain epa approval to make claims against the h5n1 bird flu virus lonza continues to lead the way in meeting the markets need for disinfectants that are proven effective against dangerous pathogens such as h5n1
223181 these formulations can be diluted on site and applied to hard non porous surfaces using a variety of application techniques e g spraying mop and bucket etc as described in the label instructions
223182 technically speaking these formulations inactivate the virus by denaturing cell proteins and disrupting the viral membrane
223183 our efforts were stepped up in march of 2006 in response to the pandemic in asia
223184 we began our initial tests which were followed by efforts to seek approvals from the u s epa regarding the use of our formulas to combat the h5n1 virus
223185 one time im listening to the radio with my son driving down the road and he said i dont know why bob huggins ever left cincinatti i said why what are you talking about he said you can recruit to cincinatti in basketball now i said why you say that he said well their uniforms i said what do you mean he said their uniforms are tight and thats why guys go to the school because of their uniforms so were going to try and have uniforms that are tight

223187 wenn wir mit der zielgruppe 14 bis 29 jahre kommunizieren kommen wir ums mobile marketing mittlerweile nicht mehr herum
223188 auf plakaten wurden die reisenden darauf hingewiesen die bluetooth schnittstelle ihres handys zu aktivieren
223189 ein und dasselbe angebot sieht auf unterschiedlichen mobiltelefonen unterschiedlich aus das bedeutet f r die dienstleister dass mobile portale individuell ausgeliefert werden m ssen
223190 wegen des kleinen bildschirms macht es auf den meisten handys derzeit noch keinen sinn auf herk mmliche nicht f r das handy optimierte webseiten zu surfen die abbildungen der html seiten sind zu klein zu un bersichtlich und schwer zu navigieren neuerungen wie der mobile safari browser des iphones zeigen die richtung in die sich das mobile internet entwickeln k nnte hin zu gr eren handyscreens und flexibleren browsern
223191 im ergebnis springt genau das gegenteil heraus so m ssen spezialisten f r die erstellung von wap seiten informationen f r rund 4 000 handymodelle in ihren datenbanken speichern
223192 aufgrund der fehlenden technischen reichweite gibt es allerdings noch keine nennenswerte praktische reichweite f r location based services es mangelt an handys die mit gps aufwarten
223193 es ist das derzeit bedeutendste interaktionsmedium f r die mobile kommunikation am point of sale etwa 50 prozent aller ger te im markt k nnen an dieser form der kabellosen daten bertragung teilnehmen tendenz steigend effektiv genutzt wird die funktion nur von zehn prozent das liegt in erster linie an den schwierigkeiten bei der handhabung zun chst muss der handynutzer wissen wie er bluetooth einschaltet gelingt die aktivierung verbraucht man zuviel strom um das ger t mit einem anderen zu verbinden ist eine ebenfalls recht komplizierte koppelungsprozedur erforderlich
223194 so hat das ibm haifa research laboratory die software pensieve http de youtube com watch v bovdsvmzv1e vorgestellt die mit mobilen endger ten erfasste bild ton und textdaten intelligent auswertet mit der neuen technologie soll es m glich sein seine pers nliche informationsflut in den griff zu bekommen und sich besser an namen personen gespr che und andere wichtige daten zu erinnern das system verwendet nach angaben von ibm assoziative erinnerungstechniken um verbindungen zwischen verwandten informationen herzustellen
223195 so k nnen fotos einer person ihrer visitenkarte sowie eine sprachnotiz mit dem handy erfasst dank integriertem gps empf nger mit einer ortsangabe verkn pft und mit einem zeitstempel versehen werden am pc werden die informationen dann mittels zeichen und spracherkennung ausgewertet und mit dem eigenen adressbuch und kalender abgeglichen die software kann die daten so miteinander verkn pfen dass sie auf unterschiedliche weise abrufbar sind nach zeit ort oder person so k nnen kontakte beispielsweise einer bestimmten konferenz zugeordnet werden

223205 ich muss berlegen ob ich rafael gegen real spielen lasse das liegt seit gestern nicht mehr in meinem bereich
223206 wir wissen welchen wert ein spieler wie rafael van der vaart hat wenn real madrid kein vern nftiges angebot unterbreitet wird er auch in der n chsten saison f r den hsv spielen
223207 jeden tag werde ich mit diesem thema konfrontiert wenn real die summe zahlt die der verein mit rafael vor einiger zeit abgesprochen hat dann wird er gehen
223208 ich w re sehr entt uscht wenn wir rafael f r eine summe ziehen lassen w rden die unter dem liegt was mit ihm verabredet wurde
223209 das w re l cherlich denn ich denke dass sein marktwert bei 30 millionen euro liegt

223249 the dog days of summer campaign is a great way to educate the 67 million american dog owners about how to keep their furry family members safe this summer
223250 summer is a crucial time for pet safety awareness we live in north carolina and it can get extremely hot here so it is important that people know the proper way to care for their pets during the summer conditions

223539 washington some 1 3 million illegal immigrants have left the united states since congress failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the summer of 2007 if the trend continues according to a new study the nations illegal population will drop by half in the next five years
223540 the dropoff in illegal immigration seems to occur before there is a runup in their unemployment rate
223541 from may to april 2007 there is an actual uptick in the number of illegals in the country which falls off after the legislation fails it seems as if the discussion of legalization had some effect on the decision to come or go or both
223542 the problem is its difficult to know whats causing a change like this
223543 but the one thing we know for sure is that the country is in a deep economic downturn if not a recession which means theres much less need for workers especially those providing services for the middle class
223544 immigration is a market driven phenomenon and thats why immigration is beneficial to the economy
223545 when we need them they come and when we dont they go home has enforcement had some effect perhaps but theres no question that the economic downturn would in and of itself have a huge effect in attracting fewer illegal immigrants and sending more home
223546 weve seen a turn of the tide in terms of illegal immigration
223547 without doubt people have left and without question fewer people are coming
223548 a lot of people doing the recruiting are friends uncles cousins relatives people crossing the border may not know what kind of work they will be doing but they know its work and theres somebody at the other end making the arrangement
223549 as ive said for years the migrants on the south side of chicago know more about the economy than the us labor department
223550 this in turn could create the illusion that the illegal population is falling when in fact the population remains unchanged
223551 the economy certainly influences immigration but thats not to say that enforcement doesnt also influence immigration
223552 with so many unskilled legal residents out of work greater enforcement coming at a time of economic stress might afford these individuals an opportunity to find new jobs
223553 if the president goes after them they could destabilise the country cause a coup a civil war they are that powerful they could bring the state down

223557 its always good to know that there is more people looking for caylee i mean thats our whole focus to find caylee
223558 ive been saying over and over again pieces are starting to come together
223559 what we want to say to her and to rest of the family is please share the information with us anybody
223560 i know i dont know where caylee is i just met with the detectives this afternoon and they didnt say anything about her having any information that right now would help us locate caylee any quicker
223561 we still feel that the key lies with casey and if she would just open up and just tell us where caylee is this could very well end quickly
223562 casey has given them as much information as she feels comfortable that she can say without jeopardizing the safety of caylee and her family
223563 i dont believe she has hurt her child or been a part of that
223564 she feels like all theyve done is focus on casey casey casey she feels like its been tunnel vision
223565 when i spoke to her today she was so excited about the fbi and speaking with them

223586 cynical manipulation of those dedicated public servants who can least afford the loss of pay and jobs in the current economic crisis
223587 arnold schwarzeneggers response to the budget impasse is a cynical manipulation of those dedicated public servants who can least afford the loss of pay and jobs in the current economic crisis
223588 arnolds apparent indifference to promoting visionary policies such as a simple majority to approve a budget suggest that he is too beholden to the state legislatures minority party to make the hard decisions necessary to minimize this annual extortion ritual and insure a more stable economic future for state employees agencies and the professional and social services that serve californias tax paying residents

223590 just a few years ago hiv aids raged out of control
223591 an entire continent was caught in the pandemics merciless grip in countries like botswana aids had cut the average life expectancy by 15 years
223592 hiv aids is still one of the worlds greatest humanitarian challenges no question about it but it is a challenge were meeting and a lot of it has to do with pepfar
223593 this new legislation will expand access to lifesaving anti retroviral drugs prevent millions of new hiv infections provide compassionate care to millions of people affected by hiv aids including orphans and vulnerable children and bolster efforts to help developing nations combat other devastating diseases like malaria and tuberculosis
223594 pepfar is one piece of a broader development agenda that is having a major impact in africa

223600 at the same time the british were making major gains in land and water transport new turnpike roads and canals intended primarily to serve industry and mining opened the way to valuable resources linked production to markets facilitated the division of labor other european countries were trying to do the same but nowhere were these improvements so widespread and effective as in britain for a simple reason nowhere else were roads and canals typically the work of private enterprise hence responsive to need rather than to prestige and military concerns and profitable to users these roads and canals hastened growth and specialization

223602 it is clear that the officer in charge oic of the welipanna police station and other responsible officers are weak and inactive spending their time only in amusement and not attending to their duty they are afraid to be otherwise in this scenario we are forced to show that the oic and other officers are not fit for police service

223605 a drop in non elective activity has had a disappointing impact on the surplus the hospital made in the first quarter of 2008 09
223606 non elective activity is notoriously unpredictable because the number of people falling ill is not easy to forecast at the beginning of the year we set ambitious targets and unfortunately this unforeseen drop in activity has affected that
223607 however the hospital is still making a surplus and the year to date performance means we just have to keep management on track to continue the hospitals improved performance
223608 however the message for the remainder of the year and beyond it is that its vital everybody in the hospital is vigilant to ensure we minimise our costs and maximise our income
223609 its a shame foundation status will be delayed and they will have to try very hard to make sure the financial position doesnt impact on patient services
223610 they are going to have to tighten their belt which is disappointing because they have worked very hard to sort their finances out and they were very excited about how they were doing
223611 its a sad day when they are in such a tight situation that they need patients to be poorly so they can be paid to look after them
223612 we send a choice of food to each ward each meal time to ensure we give our patients choice particularly those who have been admitted on that day and have not had the opportunity to fill out a request card suffolk homes
223613 it was clear to the officer that he had been drinking and the officer in fact concluded he was drunk

223636 i dont like pale imitations and shades of things and i am always wary when people go jazzy because jazz is the best cover up for a lack of talent and the cover up for her which is probably the guilt trip is that she requires vast amounts of drugs to hide the fact that she is fake
223637 further to the announcement made on july 24th 2008 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
223638 there can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer being made for british energy group
223639 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept
223640 edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
223641 that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder in a publicly listed company it is a now matter for both boards to see how to proceed
223642 the level of interest in nuclear new build in the uk from edf and from other operators remains high
223643 recent developments in energy markets underline the need for new nuclear to combat high fossil fuel prices climate change and security of supply
223644 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date

223667 we took immediate action to investigate when concerns were raised and as a result have increased our cross checking and quality control procedures to protect against a similar situation arising in the future

223713 the majority of people hate this and think its sick since when do we pass laws to appease the minority
223714 we find the musical verses of wilsons song to be such an obvious example of copyright infringement that i expect all parties to reach a relatively quick resolution to avoid litigation
223715 if they are not exact matches when is close enough enough
223716 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court
223717 the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered i would like to thank the members of the public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those who gave evidence in court
223718 it would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time except to say that we will be reflecting upon todays verdict and considering how best to proceed

223724 english policy is to float lazily downstream occasionally putting out a diplomatic boathook to avoid collisions
223725 the politics of america have such an influence on foreign policy and render the duration of supreme power so uncertain that any alliance would kill itself quicker than any one could kill it
223726 i was looking at him on the news and just thinking what an amazing moment this is watching his speech in berlin and thinking what a critical moment this is for america and for attitudes towards what they can achieve amongst the black community
223727 if barack obama can do it it will be the most fantastic boost i think for black people everywhere around the world i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world that they can win

223742 really like been a model like of how to be a really beautiful hot playwright
223743 i think its absurd that we are being called out as offensive or irresponsible in some way what are you seeing that im not whats so awful is it that were admitting as women to being both sexual and intelligent and that admission is somehow beyond our capacities as a society as yet or is it that were making fun of how some struggle to pigeonhole a creative female if she is also someone who some people think of as attractive
223744 people really care about this they are raging some at the video some at the other commenters some likely at the world is it bad that this makes me laugh a little bit or does it just mean that as a member of the theatre community i can appreciate our quirks
223745 could be used as a textbook for the luring and seduction of young girls
223746 in a way such a vitriolic outburst in response to this kind of play is a huge compliment
223747 i just want to stress that while a vitriolic outburst by an audience member can be expected from time to time where the letter writer attacking my play crossed the line is in contacting a child protection agency
223748 she never posted anything on the plethora of sites available for winnipeg fringe goers
223749 yes this all comes from the wall street journal supposedly our most substantive newspaper
223750 through clenched teeth let us affirm that its a sign of the health of our republic and the strength of our two presidential candidates that pettifogging bullshit has become a mainstay of this election
223751 pretty nice a site with loads of information seems quite promising too their claims arent even baseless they seem to know what theyre talking about this could really work for me wait a minute no way this is yet another diet program a definite scam im not falling for this
223752 already we put a team together in the ioc to work with bocog to begin to open up sites which we believe are absolutely necessary to comply with noncensored reporting of the games
223753 we are in the process of getting web sites which were previously blocked unblocked
223754 we need to protect consumers access said fcc chairman kevin martin a republican
223755 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
223756 the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
223757 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
223758 we commend chairman martin and commissioners copps and adelstein for standing up for internet users and working across party lines to protect free speech and the free market
223759 the first stars were very different from stars like the sun
223760 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
223761 we do see stars in our galaxy that have very different properties than our sun and its possible these are second generation stars
223762 abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe
223763 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point toward our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
223764 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star
223765 keeping your office straightened might help you with any memory issues youre having
223766 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
223767 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
223768 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent
223769 plaintiffs privacy claims fail among other reasons because the view of a home from the driveway that can be seen by any visitor delivery person or telephone repairman is not private
223770 todays satellite image technology means that complete privacy does not exist
223771 plaintiffs live in the 21st century united states where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass unless there is a clear expression such as a gate fence or keep out sign indicating that the public is not permitted to enter anyone may approach a home by a walkway driveway or any other route commonly used by visitors without liability for trespass
223772 q does this lead us to rethink privacy and how we protect it
223773 although the word privacy is not found in the constitution brandeis had long believed privacy one of the most precious rights he and samuel warren had written a pioneering law review article on the subject in 1890 and he returned to the theme in his dissent in olmstead v u s 1928 the court had held that wiretapping did not constitute a violation of the fourth amendment and brandeis objected to this invasion of privacy the makers of our constitution he declared conferred as against the government the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men p 478 ultimately the court adopted the idea of a constitutionally protected right of privacy in griswold v connecticut 1965

223778 right now i still believe that linux is not for everyone it is not for the faint of heart it is not for people who like to whine it is not for individuals who are not very smart or who dont really need a computer that works well and packs a punch people who dont know their ram from their rom or the difference or lack thereof between a file and a folder need to be hand held by their mac or bullied by their windows box had better stay away
223779 you dont use linux so you are faint at heart and stupid now would you like to use linux

223799 i looked at the cut ups and what i saw was no 5 making a lot of plays theres no question it was a smart design
223800 theres no question it was well planned and coached and organized
223801 yes here is what i am looking for i am looking to get a hard money loan to be based off the project only the commitment because the other funds for the project are coming as private funds is this something you can do
223802 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
223803 what this means is that we can now finally kill the press release at least in its current form
223804 i knew that the value of the company was billions of dollars however the deceptive practice of hiding myspace financials by intermix management robbed shareholders of their opportunity to adequately gauge the companys value

223819 when you help the hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool if it is a boy kill him but if it is a girl let her live
223820 why have you done this why have you let the boys live
223821 hebrew women are not like egyptian women they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive
223822 everyone at the team is deeply shocked to lose such a valued member of staff who had been with the team for 27 years
223823 before the team was taken over by renault he worked for benetton formula one we have a very large site but it happened within the premises on a footpath
223824 we come here off the back of two rather difficult races and our target here has to be to extract the full potential of our package and then try to secure the best possible result
223825 fridays results always have to be looked at with caution especially at a track like the hungaroring which is always very dirty on the first day clearly we are up against some very strong opposition on a track where historically we have usually struggled a bit but i am confident we can have a good race
223826 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition but clearly they are very quick i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface we know in which direction we have to work and we will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident all the same
223827 we worked on various set up options for the car i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail the situation is not too bad the car handles better but our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race
223828 quite a good day today the gearbox did a good job and we didnt have any issues at all the car balance was still difficult as the track is not yet at its best so it was hard to find a good set up on my last run i had some traffic and couldnt really get the maximum out of it but i have a good feeling all the same i think we are on the right track and the car is behaving well with no problems i hope we can translate this into a good performance tomorrow in qualifying
223829 the upshift is better with the new gearbox and obviously a good step forward but unfortunately for us we are not going to use it tomorrow and sunday we are struggling with the grip level at the moment as there is a lot of inconsistency and the balance is not quite there over the day the track conditions did improve a lot and the last 10 to 15 minutes of the second session were much better lets see for tomorrow and how it improves again as we use it more
223830 a weakness in the dns protocol may allow remote attackers to perform dns cache poisoning attacks
223831 as a result systems that rely on the bind server for dns may receive forged information this update addresses the issue by implementing source port randomization to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks
223832 our goal is to sell at least 2 000 of product per day at each location this is a major step forward for bayshore and based on this success we hope to be able to sell even more products and be in more costco locations in time for the christmas shopping season

223835 minister finley has been a tireless proponent of an exit package for tobacco farmers
223836 as such the conservative government has been committed to finding a responsible solution ive said it before and i will say it again the conservative government is committed to putting farmers first
223837 through our work with the ontario flue cured tobacco growers marketing board our government has produced real results and shown our commitment to farmers
223838 tobacco producers and their families will be able to bring closure to what has been a very stressful time this program is available to help producers exit the industry transition to other crops or find new opportunities outside agriculture
223839 this is not only a win for farmers its a win for all tobacco affected communities

223849 by open sourcing the core technology in our web and proxy server suns goal is to give developers more flexibility choice and help them achieve faster time to market

223857 since the accident there has been no normal life for him he was dependent on outside help for everything
223858 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
223859 for more than a year we have been privileged to represent dr bruce ivins during the investigation of the anthrax deaths of september and october of 2001
223860 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
223861 a quiet man he was always very helpful and pleasant
223862 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
223863 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
223864 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
223865 unfortunately they might be talking about him like ryan leaf as one of the worst draft decisions
223866 where previously a full scale search for a missing person suffering from a memory disorder might last for days and require extensive public safety resources now it may be concluded in just a matter of minutes
223867 but it can save our field personnel hundreds of hours
223868 you move it a few degrees and you can hear a distinct difference
223869 you just end up knocking on doors and hunting around
223870 i expect project lifesavers success to be measured not only by a savings in taxpayer dollars but also by something priceless the value of lives saved as a result of this worthwhile project
223871 relieve the burden on families struggling with high gas and grocery bills or preparing for high heating bills
223872 even before the polar bear received threatened status under the endangered species act in may a host of organizations were already laying the groundwork for a legal challenge as early as last january jim sims the president and ceo of the western business roundtable which reps for oil and mining interests sent an email to colleagues detailing a strategy to quite possibly reverse the ruling if the worst came to pass part of it would involve litigation filed by a truly extraordinary plaintiff roy innis the chairman of the congress of racial equality core a decades old civil rights group that has taken a sharp turn to the right under his leadership joining forces with conservative activists particularly on issues related to the environment it looks like the plan is finally in motion
223873 its gratifying to see epa chief stephen johnson writhing under pressure to resign in disgrace the agency is being hounded by lawsuits from states while johnson faces perjury accusations from congress my question what took so long documenting the agencys recent betrayals of the public interest would take a book not a blog post myself im still seething over last years decision to approve methyl iodide a powerfully carcinogenic substance for use on strawberry fields i dont have the stamina to keep up with the epas chronic foot dragging on climate change which will likely shape the historical legacy of the johnson era
223874 if on the slim chance greenhouse gasses are a problem we can hardly be said to be doing nothing now were proceeding apace with research to develop alternative energy sources that dont produce greenhouse gasses along with taking another look at nuclear power that environmentalists shouted down in the seventies one day well be far less dependent on fossil fuels even without the foolishly accelerated schedule of ridding the planet of carbon based fuels that the sierra clubs and the al gores of the world are insisting on pelosi and shatner have good excuses for their foolishness on this issue pelosi is a democratic politician and is therefore obliged to kiss up to environmentalists and other progressive groups as for shatner kirk its probably not too much time in space thats caused his problem rather too much time in the weightlessness of hollywood mccain on the other hand has no excuse
223875 we have forgotten about our closest source of water at home the tap yet one of the simplest ways to reduce our environmental impact to save money not a ton yet and to free ourselves from shopping and storage hassle is by saying goodbye to bottled water a life cycle assessment commissioned by the swiss gas and water association traced the entire life cycle from water extraction to serving it up in a glass their findings showed that tap water has less than one percent of the impacts of un refrigerated bottled water even when the tap water is refrigerated its impact is only one quarter of that of bottled water these astonishing figures show that tap water is hands down the greenest and most responsible choice
223876 in april police hauled off mark nolt in handcuffs for being a dairy deviant pennsylvanias commonwealth court cited the mennonite farmer for contempt after he ignored a 2007 injunction prohibiting him from selling raw milk and cheese
223877 since the environment is not a person either real or incorporeal the environment can have no property rights that can be damaged by human action and resolved under tort law indeed the environment is not property subject to any human authority furthermore tracing specific human acts to actual permanent effects on the general physical environment let alone damages is a daunting task riddled with questionable assumptions if so environmental protection is a myth having no legal or ethical standing therefore laws purporting to protect the environment are invalid null and void prosecutions under them must be considered political scams because there is no identifiable property to examine for damage let alone specific culpability for the consequences without a property issue there can be no determinate cause and effect in society and thus no resolvable question of justice or welfare
223878 the combination of a higher unemployment rate and weaker hours worked makes this a weaker than expected report and further adds to the case that the u s is in recession
223879 the labor market is a lagging indicator of economic activity and job declines so far this year reflect weakness in the overall economy in late 2007 and early 2008 still the recent decline in jobs is much smaller than has been typical of past periods of economic weakness we think q2 real gdp growth reported yesterday at a 1 9 annual growth rate will be revised up in the months ahead and that the us will grow at about a 3 rate in the second half of 2008 as a result we believe the worst job losses are behind us and expect payrolls to turn positive again sometime in the next few months
223880 the report is weaker than the headline looks since the workweek shrank to 33 6 hours hours worked fell by 0 4 percent month to month
223881 the banking crisis high oil prices and the large trade deficit with china are causing employers to relocate to asia rather than endure in the u s tsunami going forward the economy will add some jobs for college graduates with technical specialties in finance health care education and engineering however for high school graduates without specialized technical skills or training and for college graduates with only liberal arts diplomas jobs offering good pay and benefits remain tough to find for those workers who compose about half the working population the quality of jobs continues to spiral downward
223882 the labor market continued its slow motion decline in july with another 51 000 jobs lost though the decline wasnt huge it was very broadly based with only healthcare and mining showing anything that could be described as strength hours worked per week declined which is a bad sign for future hiring
223883 unemployment among teenagers has increased nearly 5 percentage points over the past three months and teenagers appear to have accounted for roughly two thirds of the increase in the unemployment rate during july the higher teenage unemployment rate coincides with the second installment of the increased minimum wage the higher minimum wage means that teenagers now must compete with more experienced workers for jobs

223923 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world

223925 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly

223934 als er dann verschwand hat er noch die falschinformation verbreitet dass er nach einer absprache mit mir nicht verfolgt w rde
223935 ive been happy with demps you can see that first of all he had a lot of interceptions in college and you always want to see if that carries over to the pro game in these practices here you see him getting his hands on the ball and making catches now weve got him playing both corner and safety and hes able to handle that mentally and physically and that makes him a valuable guy as long as he can continue to improve in those areas then the rest of the rookies are doing great i think theyve been working their tail off and theyre playing very well out here
223936 again youre dealing with a smart guy there that gives you a little flexibility with what you can do with hank hes playing very well right now and hes catching the ball real well were seeing him go up and the quarterbacks just put the ball up hes covered they put the ball up and he goes and gets the thing he can about jump out of the house hes got a great vertical jump and hes utilizing that better he looks to me stronger than what hes been in the past and hes got that big body to go with it hes playing very well right now
223937 again youre dealing with a smart guy there that gives you a little flexibility with what you can do with hank

223940 they are very important theyre a big part of the middle of your defense how they play is important im a little hard on those two but its for a reason i expect their play to be top notch youve got to be strong through the middle of your defense and it starts with those two
223941 i want them to keep their game high every play theres no time to relax i know its hard in there youve got people coming from all different directions youve got a lot of big bodies beating on you its important that you are mentally tough and that you utilize your strength throughout the practice you cant be like a thermometer where you start up here and end down here you have to maintain that strength throughout a two hour practice and be fine for a game

224102 there are substantial home grown networks supporting and carrying out attacks possibly with technical help from overseas
224103 it is no longer sustainable to claim that there is no home grown threat
224104 what seems to be happening is that the recruiters have managed to relate peoples experience in india of communal violence with the global narrative of muslims being oppressed globally
224105 there is a danger of the indianised jihad spreading to other areas
224106 we feel as though we have a unique opportunity to help colorado drivers and the environment by assisting drivers increase fuel economy we are helping them financially but also reducing the greenhouse gases emitted into the environment we encourage everyone to pick up our free more mpg gas savings booklet today
224107 the hearing in houston focused on the myriad fair housing issues arising after the devastation of hurricanes katrina and rita and address systemic problems in federal housing programs the affordable housing crisis on the gulf coast and fair housing problems arising from the accompanying diaspora continue and this hearing will offer important testimony and perspective of what has happened in light of housing problems discussed at other hearings
224108 the images of the hurricanes of 2005 made it clear that racial discrimination and segregation have prevented generations from gaining opportunities because housing is a crucial link in all aspects of our lives it is incumbent upon our government to carry out strong fair housing enforcement and education in order to prevent a recurrence of segregated living patterns fair housing must be an essential component of our dialogue if we are truly sincere about the need to eradicate segregation and lift the barriers to viable strong and integrated communities
224109 three years after hurricane katrina a silent storm persists there are constant reports of families trying to put their lives back together now encountering housing discrimination unlike katrina which did not discriminate by race or socio economic standing we can do something to prevent this
224110 this hearing before the national bar association in houston should prove extremely valuable in fulfilling our mission to examine the structural inequality that still exists today in every region of the country it is imperative that the commission hear testimony about the critical housing issues still affecting the katrina diaspora including discrimination segregation and the wholesale displacement of communities of color
224111 my name is jennifer tater i am 39 years old with two kids who also love tennis i am a neighborhood player and am active in
224112 i was lucky enough to go to the davis cup match in winston salem last april
224113 i really try to teach my kids that hard work and integrity can lead you far in life and i think andy stands for both of those principals i will continue to follow andy in all his matches
224114 while the national economic news remains bleak improvements in the local economy are encouraging
224115 our team has worked diligently over the past two years to improve the credit quality of our loan portfolio and the results are apparent loans past due 30 or more days are at 2 33 of total loans a four year low even more encouraging in light of all the talk about delinquent home loans is that our past due rate on owner occupied one to four family residential properties is 1 68 compared to 6 35 nationally as reported by the mortgage bankers association for the first quarter non performing loans as of june 30 2008 were 8 200 000 compared to 9 935 000 at december 31 2007 and 10 099 000 at june 30 2007 at the same time while our loan loss reserve is at 3 470 000 up 15 over the same period last year compared to december 2007 it has come down reflecting positive trends in our portfolio based on our analysis we are confident that our reserves remain appropriate
224116 as a community bank we consider it essential to keep the bank well capitalized
224117 during slower growth times like these we are pleased to be able to return equity to our shareholders in the form of a higher dividend the annualized dividend rate is 6 7 and is particularly valuable based on the favorable dividend tax rate
224118 matters get more complicated when the influx of non dayak labourers tips the balance demographically and politcally
224119 the local dayak population have many adat rights over rattan and durian orchards dotted across the forests most of the oil palm planters ignore these interests matters get more complicated when the influx of non dayak labourers tips the balance demographically and politcally
224120 i dont think well see a repeat of sampit we communicate between the different communities central kalimantan is for all of us
224121 comparatively sabahs received more in terms of investment from the federal government than central kalimantan received from jakarta
224122 if were serious about pan borneo economic linkages weve got to start somewhere and build relations whether its through culture or tourism
224123 combat recreational drug use not to regulate a states medical practices
224124 the cards let police know they shouldnt waste their time harassing or otherwise investigating patients who are legal under california law
224125 federal law clearly regulates medical practices it says marijuana has no currently accepted medical use

224128 im happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
224129 in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
224130 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague jujus
224131 this kind of remark has no place in any setting and martin knows that
224132 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret
224133 i hope that the continuing work of the organization will not by 21 questions the new york questionnaire
224134 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day
224135 it looked about the size of an average fox gray in color eyes like a mole hairless and was breathing quite heavily
224136 needless to say we were freaked out by this discovery and fled the area quickly
224137 the surfer said he had no idea what it was but that he threw it in the dunes because he didnt want to be surfing next to it
224138 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
224139 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
224140 he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others
224141 obama hopes to use the racism card to inhibit all criticism of him with the presumed cooperation of the press
224142 merit the outraged accusations from the mccain camp that obama is playing the race card
224143 exploited an opportunity to overreact and they must know it
224144 tap into the qualms some white working class voters in crucial swing states may have about a black candidate or it could ricochet back against the mccain campaign
224145 b y charging that obama is playing the race card the mccain campaign is itself playing the race card
224146 he degrades his brand and undermines one of the most compelling rationales for the presidential candidacy of a first term senator with few legislative achievements and little national experience
224147 not only contemptible but shrewd it puts the sin for the racial attack not on those who made it but on the victim of the attack
224148 completely unfair diminishes his own campaign and certainly is the worst possible way to win over those blue collar white democrats in ohio and pennsylvania
224149 to find effective ways to blame the other campaign for any unpalatable racial subtext
224150 be distracted and ultimately diminished by constant charges of racism accurate or not
224151 acknowledging all the subterranean doubts and suspicions that threaten his bid and saying preemptively that to succumb to them would be to fall prey to politics as usual
224152 proves that when playing the playing the race card card the impression you create an impression of your rival saying something racially outrageous that benefits you politically is far more important than whether or not you actually think he said something racially outrageous
224153 anything more off putting to the people whom obama needs to bring into the fold those bittergate voters he dissed once before than this line of attack
224154 a nytime race is the topic du jour in the campaign its a bad day for obama period
224155 knock obama off his message of the day and keep him busy responding to these charges

224157 were proud of the partnership weve developed with u s olympic teams over the past several years
224158 our sponsorship is a natural fit with our companys role of providing high quality protein to hungry people including those who are training to win gold medals
224159 like many other americans im looking forward to the beijing games and especially the performances of the u s athletes
224160 i also appreciate the opportunity to be part of tyson foods sponsorship of the u s olympic team as a mom im especially pleased to work with a company known for providing the nutritious protein people need to remain healthy and active whether theyre children playing at a neighborhood park or trained athletes competing at the olympic games
224161 tayib cant you just take your milk and make butter with it
224162 a deep anxiety because people do want to know moral rules to live by
224163 the ability to act on the basis of own considered will
224164 few people who survived auschwitz continued to believe in the all powerful all good heavenly father or the scriptures
224165 therefore clive hamilton seems to pick up this challenge ignore the illusions of secular prosperity and lead us to something different who would not see some value in it
224166 i think the environmental urgency he responds to forces us to new thinking about the mysteries of existence
224167 its not very fashionable to espouse religious views so hes espousing a non spiritual spirituality which leaves everyone feeling somewhat confused he didnt know the solution it seems to be to charge up with some communal force but he doesnt say what it is or what it means
224168 its the idea of the classic philosophers life where you set yourself up as critical of modern life
224169 the big issue for me is this is all about morals and has political implications that are not spelled out
224170 i dont want someone deciding political implications on the basis of their own morals which would impinge on my freedom
224171 what i would endorse is that clive hamilton is resonating with a very ancient religious and philosophical tradition
224172 it looks as though the population believes climate change is serious and there seems to be momentum behind the issue and there are some people who dont like that
224173 there are still plenty of creationists around and there are people who believe tobacco is not linked to serious health effects and so there are still people who choose to ignore or doubt the amount of evidence for climate change
224174 we would kill literally kill for a good paper that proved the science on global warming was wrong
224175 then i could retire and accept my chair at harvard unfortunately thats not going to happen and theres vast amounts of evidence why
224176 in essence the models we use to predict climate have been proven right
224177 you feed in the greenhouse gas concentrations that weve seen and the models predict extremely well the climate variations weve seen if you dont do that you get nothing the mathematical probability of it being a chance mistake or the wrong numbers is astronomical
224178 if theres been any change at all recently its that the observational evidence suggests were moving away from the lower limits of the abc projections towards more serious scenarios ive certainly seen no evidence of scientists holding back on their views or suppressing findings or anything approaching that
224179 i think there is healthy scepticism and then theres unhealthy scepticism
224180 what you do see is people who will claim that simply because they have a phd in engineering that they are an expert on climate modelling
224181 the other side of the coin is the danger that people who want to discuss the legitimate scientific issues in public becoming less if they are going to be called dangers we do need to keep giving scientists the freedom to go back and forth on these issues and apply their scepticism
224182 i think of all the teams we could have had that is the toughest or one of the toughest fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this card on one hand it is very very tough we know that but on the other very exciting
224183 keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions small people always do that but the really great make you feel that you too can become great
224184 we continue to see a vital need for dental treatment for underserved individuals especially children in the communities we serve and these grants are aimed specifically at tackling issues related to that problem
224185 beyond treatment we believe that education for children and caregivers is a critical component to making lifelong changes in improving a childs oral health
224186 given the current state of the economy we are encouraged by the high number of workers feeling secure in their jobs and the rise in the percentage of workers who are confident in the future of their employers
224187 as i speak to our clients across the country i continue to hear questions about worker confidence and their actual likelihood to leave their jobs in this environment
224188 why successful businesses fail how to keep it from happening to you
224189 these jobs cuts are going to translate into hardship in communities all up and down the state and this sends the message that these employees arent as valuable as other employees
224190 were a quasi state institution but structurally and formally were independent of the state
224191 were looking at our situation and our operation and even though these things dont directly apply were looking at the things we have to do to address our own budget and help the state
224192 china has been experiencing similar problems during its industrial revolution that western nations saw during their period of rapid growth pollution environmental damage and resource depletion
224193 domestically we are being constrained in many ways we do not have that many natural resources anymore
224194 we have to rely on the international markets so there is a big security concern there
224195 in order to really drive towards a low carbon economy policy incentives are crucial but it is not always the case
224196 the wind sectors fast growth was mainly a result of domestic policies because the government offered incentives to developments so that private and public sector entrepreneurs would jump on it
224197 but the solar pv sector benefitted mainly from the international market such as demand from the us and eu
224198 even today the policy incentives are still not there yet it still has grown to the level it is now
224199 in terms of total emissions china is already the worlds biggest emitter
224200 thats publicly available information even the government is not denying it anymore
224201 but if you look at emissions on a per capita basis we are not the biggest emitters because we have 1 3bn people
224202 but just looking at numbers does not help tackle global climate change
224203 in china we are concerned about the speed of growth in emissions it is really scary
224204 if they are not able to do it with the technology available to them then is it reasonable to expect china and india to do it
224205 china does not commit itself to a number and then not deliver
224206 the breakdown of talks is worrying but not critical to the future of new build nuclear in the uk time is not on our side as the government has left it very late to give a firm direction for nuclear we need a clear resolution quickly as further delays might make it difficult to fill the looming energy gap
224207 the lowes have not met their burden of showing a probability of prevailing because they have submitted no evidence of any defamatory statements that were not made in anticipation of this litigation
224208 she isnt going to be intimidated by the lowes and all their money and fame and high priced cadre of lawyers
224209 im delighted with the courts ruling today it removed the retaliation claim which ms allred had been focusing on and left in six claims which allows us to prosecute every claim weve made
224210 the first objective is in the context of the framework convention on climate change to determine the factors of emissions in order to carry out an inventory of greenhouse gases released by the sector
224211 the countries of the developing south according to the convention must adopt measures but are not obligated like the industrialised countries to reduce their emissions that is why we want to know for the countries like new zealand that do have an obligation how much they emit and how they are going to cut emissions

224217 new nuclear build is supposed to be a central part of the governments energy strategy but it seems to be dependent on the decisions of foreign companies over whom it has absolutely no control
224218 disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful
224219 time is not on our side as the government has left it very late to give a firm direction for nuclear we need a clear resolution quickly as further delays might make it difficult to fill the looming energy gap
224220 it is pathetic that a government minister who not only controls 35 of british energy shares and who also has to commit public and consumers money to guarantee the future viability of the industry and who represents the public interest when it comes to licensing and planning should allow himself to be pushed about by british energy shareholders who simply want to cash in on their ownership of licensed nuclear sites
224221 hutton has got to get a grip and put the interest of the uk public who foot the bill before the self interest of the shareholders
224222 this takeover would have taken us back to the old days of a state subsidised monopolised nuclear power sector
224223 the french government via edf would have the monopoly while the british government via the taxpayer would have shelled out subsidies to the tune of billions
224224 i confirm our ambition to be a major actor of the nuclear rebirth in britain we have been working on that for three years and we have taken measures to reach this target
224225 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
224226 take it easy doc youre boldly going where no man has gone before

224233 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
224234 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
224235 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
224236 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision

224241 dont try to figure me out im too confusing for you
224242 weve discovered that johns practice as a plaintiffs trial lawyer and the firms continued growth in health care toxic tort defense management labor and general business has created conflicts of interest that have precluded john from taking the cases that hes particularly good at
224243 regrettably a personal injury plaintiffs practice is at times not consistent with a large corporate health and business law firm

224253 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
224254 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
224255 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
224256 hey what about the anthrax attacks in 2001 whatever happened with that why did bushco lose interest
224257 i got an email from the national register of personal trainers offering me the chance to take part in the olympics but i deleted it as im not really one for putting myself up for things
224258 a week later i got another email about it so i told my mum ann who eventually talked me into applying for it
224259 i then had an interview and found out id been selected while i was on holiday in la
224260 the atmosphere around the olympic games is something special and its going to be great to not only savour at least some of that but also be able to play a part in getting athletes ready for what may be the peak of their sporting careers

224262 i am frustrated by the lack of debate by the lack of candid discussion by the inability of leadership in both parties to cut through all the political nonsense roll up their sleeves and get down to work and come up with a solution that makes america stronger

224264 only those who visited the zoo more than 15 years ago remember the pavilion of water birds called bechyn s pavilion at that time they could find penguins flamingos pewits and other water birds in an exposition full of greenery and without any fencing the complex reconstruction of the pavilion has retained its original and unique look although the concept is different the interior of the pavilion called now sichuan is designed for bird inhabitants of the foothills of the himalayas again the only barrier here is water
224265 african rocks that is what we call the new go through aviary under the rock opposite the pavilion of big tortoises which was opened in september 2004 the aviary was built mainly for the critically endangered species of waldrapp ibises which nest in the rock niches and seek for the sun lit and sun heated rock walls apart from them you can find here open billed storks wood storks red billed choughs and other interesting species of birds

224286 hes a very good judge but we just feel because judge carter is a main witness in the case and because she sits on that bench that all of the judges should be disqualified
224287 there were significant reasons to justify his not hearing this case

224293 wingsix customers have intense loyalty to the brand due to the excellent service they consistently received were excited for the opportunity to continue the outstanding service and support and further develop the wingsix brand
224294 after reviewing all of our options uk 2 was the best fit for our customers offering a high standard of care in customer service and a local chicago based team
224295 after these violent attacks we have had to suspend activities and evacuate all our staff from tawila and shangil tobaya
224296 it was a difficult decision because this suspension of activities leaves the people with no medical care but it is impossible for our teams to work and provide medical aid without a minimum guarantee of security and respect for humanitarian work
224297 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations

224370 be it the plot use of flashy colours like red modern lifestyles and nail biting suspense the movie was perhaps the best adaptation of hitchcock thrillers
224371 bollywood has borrowed liberally from filmmaker alfred hitchcock his stylised cinematography found its way into several thrillers in the decades spanning the fifties to the seventies
224372 chiefly because hitchcock is a master of the craft of cinema and in handling matters of human sexuality
224373 it is difficult to place hitchcocks movies in the context of a hindi sic indian lifestyle and the old world appeal of bollywood movies of the 50s 60s and the 70s
224374 anamika made this year is a remake of rebecca the appeal of the movie lies in its dramatisation
224375 the nature of sounds and music also took off from hitchcock the songs seemed to be emanating from another world and enveloping you the bollywood remakes of hitchcock movies also used the strong sexual metaphors that hitchcock inserted into his films like drops of water on a womans face sweat nervousness all a symbolising latent sexual frisson in intimate sequences of intrigue and passion

224383 weve been working on operation benevolent diyala for a while now
224384 we received intelligence information from people in the community that the iraqi media leaked out information of this operation and now we are trying to start this mission early in order to stay a step ahead of the bad people
224385 mitt is unique because we work directly with the ia
224386 we advise them and help point them in the right direction for their mission there is a language barrier however we have very good interpreters and all of us on mitt are trying to learn arabic as well to ease with the barriers
224387 this is the first mission that the ia have actually planned and executed without any influence from coalition forces so this is a very key mission for them
224388 they set a standard for themselves and they are trying to achieve it its very rewarding to be here and see the ias put their training into action
224389 the people who live in the villages support al qaeda and help them attack innocent people
224390 weve got intelligence information on these people and so were conducting search operations to eradicate any remaining al qaeda members and insurgents from iraq by capturing or arresting them
224391 this operation will be successful i am sure of it
224392 we feel comfortable enough to reassure the citizens of iraq that we will secure a safer iraq for them by keeping troops in the areas at all times we cannot leave these areas without security after we search them or else the bad people will return and continue to terrorize iraq
224393 we are working with one hand on one team with the u s military
224394 the u s has helped us so iraq will be able to one day stand on its own two feet
224395 we went out to find bad guys and weapons caches
224396 the outcome was the 4 1 qrf were able to utilize the training they received and detain several al qaida members and find a large weapons cache
224397 what the ias are doing is commendable because they are making history by being the first qrf in iraq meaning this unit this division is responsible for responding to anything that would cause harm to any province in iraq

224447 the coverage generated a great amount of interest for which we were initially grateful but it was overwhelming
224448 you can imagine that those established search engines have more infrastructure than our little startup and quite frankly we got all that traffic and that brought machines down and redundancies were not so redundant after all
224449 when a machine goes down and that machine has the results you were looking for because of our specialized architecture you might have gotten no results we were completely under water
224450 oh come on demand for fast food restaurants who really wants that crap
224451 too often the community voices are shut out of the process
224452 darin lahood has made a concerted effort to be available to all peorians and to listen to their concerns about the criminal justice system his commitment and attention to these issues as a candidate will undoubtedly translate to an accessible and attentive states attorneys office something sorely needed i am honored to assist darin with his efforts and when he is elected in november i will proudly serve on the uac
224453 law abiding citizens in many parts of our community have lost faith in the local criminal justice system
224454 it is critical that we re establish this level of trust and the obvious simple first step is to improve communication thats what i intend to do with the uac and i am very excited about the positive response this announcement has received
224455 there are no changes our preparations will be the same
224456 we are still assuming the armm autonomous region in muslim mindanao elections will push through

224458 judul akan dipilih berdasarkan kesesuaian di samping mempunyai kekuatan dan lebih menonjol untuk diangkat sebagai tayangan perdana
224459 tayangan eksklusif ini dapat disaksikan lebih 450 tetamu menerusi dua pawagam yang disediakan di lokasi acara perasmian
224460 menyuntik sedikit kelainan berbanding acara tahun terdahulu penyampai anugerah adalah terdiri daripada mereka yang pernah menjulang trofi pada malam ffm yang lalu
224461 sementara itu persembahan selingan pula akan menampilkan petikan lagu daripada filem dari era 60 an hingga terkini untuk memaparkan perjalanan serta kebangkitan era filem melayu
224462 bagaimanapun keutamaan kami adalah acara anugerah kerana ffm21 mengiktiraf jasa anak seni yang cemerlang serta menyumbang kepada pembangunan industri perfileman
224463 gembira akhirnya apa yang saya impikan terlaksana inilah yang saya inginkan dan akhirnya buah tangan pertama saya dapat dihasilkan
224464 saya bersyukur kerana sempat merakamkan lagu itu sebab saya antara penggemar lirik lirik ciptaan arwah
224465 mungkin ramai yang akan kata macam macam mengenai diri saya dan single pertama saya ini tapi saya yakin masyarakat sekarang semakin bijak untuk menilai dahulu dari terus berkata kata yang kurang membina
224466 saya sudah bagi yang terbaik jadi saya mengharapkan agar mereka dapat menerima buah tangan saya ini seadanya
224467 saya mahu berdiri di atas kaki sendiri sebab itu pelbagai pertandingan nyanyian saya cuba masuk
224468 mtv sangat berbangga apabila diberi peluang untuk kembali bekerjasama dengan mereka ini adalah persembahan kedua the pussycat dolls bersama mtvaa
224469 membawakan hanya yang sensasi dan terbaru mtvaa 2008 menjanjikan yang terbaik untuk pencinta muzik
224470 peluang bekerjasama dengan mtvaa memudahkan kami untuk mendekati golongan muda di seluruh asia bencana alam yang menimpa china dan myanmar memberi kesan kepada jutaan manusia
224471 ketika proses pemulihan sedang berjalan setiap kita mempunyai peranan untuk membantu mereka membina semula kehidupan demi masa depan yang cemerlang
224472 jika dua tahun ada kesilapan atau perkara yang tidak memuaskan hati banyak pihak tentang malam anugerah ffm untuk kali ini kita harap segalanya boleh diatasi
224473 bukan sahaja menjanjikan satu produksi yang menarik berbanding tahun lepas tahun ini ada kelainan yang cuba kami lakukan
224474 yang paling ketara acara penyampaian anugerah bagi para pemenang tahun ini akan disampaikan oleh barisan pemenang anugerah ffm terdahulu
224475 sebagai contoh azean irdawaty yang pernah diangkat sebagai aktres terbaik pada ffm yang pertama akan dijemput sebagai penyampai bagi anugerah pelakon wanita terbaik tahun ini
224476 saida dan sairah kini menjadi artis siti nurhaliza pro duction m sdn bhd snp sebagai permulaan snp menerbitkan album mereka berdua secara bersama me muatkan tiga lagu solo masing masing serta dua lagu duet
224477 single sairah hero wayang sudah siap dan kini diedarkan kepada stesen radio manakala single saida sedalamnya cinta akan menyusul tidak lama lagi
224478 konsep muzik yang mereka tampilkan juga berbeza kerana sairah lebih menjurus kepada pop moden manakala saida konsep pop saya juga memberi kebebasan kepada mereka memilih konsep muzik yang ingin diketengahkan asalkan ia sesuai dengan suara mereka dan keadaan semasa
224479 saya juga sedar dalam keadaan ekonomi sekarang ke utamaan masyarakat bukan lagi membeli album sebaliknya perkara lain yang disifatkan lebih penting apa yang saya tekankan pemilihan lagu yang sedap didengar
224480 bagi saya penyanyi perlu tampil dengan album kerana daripada itu akan datang peluang untuk menjayakan per sembahan pentas dan juga program televisyen
224481 saya rasa ia bukan satu isu malah tidak salah saya menolong saida dan sairah dengan mengundang mereka menjayakan program yang saya jayakan bila lagi nak tolong mereka lagi pun kalau bukan saya yang menolong mereka siapa lagi
224482 saya ada peluang apa salahnya bantu mereka dengan mencadangkannya kepada penganjur atau penerbit tele visyen tapi saya sekadar mencadangkan jika mereka terima alhamdulillah
224483 kalau mereka menolak saya tidak pula memaksa tapi nampaknya mereka bersetuju apabila dicadangkan nama mereka berdua ketika persembahan laman santai begitu juga program raya itu
224484 selagi mampu saya akan terus menghasilkan album baru maklumlah buat album keluar duit sendiri ditambah pula keadaan ekonomi sekarang yang tidak begitu menggalak kan
224485 saya juga sedar tumpuan masyarakat kini bukan pada album sebaliknya mengamalkan jimat cermat dengan ber belanja sesuatu yang dirasakan lebih penting
224486 pada waktu sama penyanyi perlu muncul dengan album baru supaya kehadiran mereka tidak dilupakan insya allah album baru berkonsep tradisional akan berada di pasaran akhir tahun ini
224487 saya kini ada masa menonton wayang bersama suami dan anak anak pada hujung minggu atau bercuti bersama ke luarga baru baru ini saya juga berpeluang bercuti di pulau pinang dan mencuba parasailing ia aktiviti yang sudah lama ingin saya lakukan tetapi tiada peluang
224488 so if nascar wants to come back they better figure it out because i dont think the fans want to come back and see that
224489 kami amat berterima kasih kepada berita harian kerana membantu menaikkan nama kami terus terang kerana abpbh nama kami naik dan dikenali disebabkan berita harian juga ramai artis mula memandang hasil kerja kami antaranya siti nurhaliza erra dan beberapa artis lagi
224490 anugerah pereka popular ini pula bagi kami adalah satu benda baru yang sangat bermanfaat
224491 bagaimanapun kami tidak meletakkan harapan yang tinggi untuk menang siapa tidak mahu menang tetapi semua itu bergantung kepada peminat untuk mengundi
224492 memang sekarang saya sudah mula pilih tawaran yang berkualiti sahaja saya akan pertimbangkan pertama sekali skrip jika jalan cerita bagus seronoklah sikit berlakon
224493 kalau asyik dapat watak dan cerita yang lebih kurang sama bukan saya saja yang bosan penonton pun bosan tengok lakonan saya
224494 kalau orang kata saya mula memilih tawaran itu memang benar sebab saya rasa sekarang ini masa yang sesuai untuk saya berbuat demikian
224495 saya rasa bertuah kerana dapat berlakon dengan orang yang hebat dalam bidang lakonan dan mereka sendiri menasihati saya supaya mula memilih tawaran yang datang
224496 bukan untuk berlagak atau pun demand sebab ada produksi yang memberikan jalan cerita yang bagus pun memberi bayaran murah sekarang saya pentingkan kualiti dan juga kepuasan diri bukannya wang semata mata
224497 saya bukan berlakon sebab tidak ada duit kerana itu akan menyebabkan saya berlakon main tangkap muat sahaja tetapi saya mahu berlakon dengan penuh kesungguhan barulah watak yang saya lakonkan akan meninggalkan kesan
224498 kerjaya semakin berkembang saya rasa biasa saja masih seperti dulu masih juga melepak dengan rakan rakan jika ada masa masih buat kerja grafik seperti kad perkahwinan jika ada permintaan semuanya sama tidak ada yang berubah
224499 cerita ini agak unik sebab saya kena pegang dua watak sekali gus sebagai orang dari zaman silam iaitu sebagai mastura dan satu lagi watak ialah sebagai pelajar perubatan pada masa kini iaitu sebagai marisa
224500 apa yang saya boleh katakan memang agak sukar untuk saya bawa dua watak ini tetapi atas bantuan kabir semuanya berjalan dengan lancar
224501 dalam drama ini banyak babak saya kena berlakon seorang diri dan membayangkan benda yang tidak ada depan mata itu yang susahnya sebab efek hanya akan dimasukkan semasa suntingan nanti
224502 saya juga alami beberapa kecederaan kecil kerana buat adegan lagak ngeri sendiri jadi saya alami sakit badan dan lebam lebam sakit memang sakit tetapi bila tengok hasilnya semua kesakitan itu hilang
224503 sebenarnya setiap benda baru susah untuk dilakukan sama juga dengan saya walaupun pernah bekerja dengan kabir tetapi ini drama serama pertama saya sebab itu bagi saya ia agak susah
224504 selain itu dia kabir agak cerewet kalau tidak dapat apa yang diinginkan susahlah kami sebagai pelakon ketawa ini kerana dia pernah mengarah filem jadi cara dia mengarah drama pun seakan akan filem dan kerana ketelitiannya drama ini mengambil masa yang panjang
224505 pernah juga ada ketika kami tidak jadi lakukan pengambaran hanya kerana props untuk drama ini tidak ada kabir memang ambil kira daripada solekan mutu lakonan dan segalanya dalam drama ini saya rasa seronok sebab dapat bekerja dengan produksi yang sungguh profesional
224506 ramai juga kawan cerita kalau berlakon drama seram kena hati hati sebab benda benda halus ini akan ikut kita dan mengganggu tetapi syukur semuanya berjalan lancar
224507 kami memang rancang tidak mahu kawan lama lama sangat kalau kawan lama takut nanti perasaan cinta itu hilang tetapi sekarang ini belum lagi sebab bapa saya pun baru meninggal
224508 has closed several offices and eliminated the creative departments in several more
224509 hey just wondering what the heck is going on with jwt inside heard a bunch of shops are being closed call me
224510 the writing is on the wall for closing more offices they arent even keeping employees informed
224511 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
224512 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
224513 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
224514 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision
224515 texas is utilizing all available resources to meet storm victims needs but the long range effects of this disaster without fema individual assistance and public assistance will have devastating and lasting consequences for the entire region

224519 we are not sure whether the negative emotions expressed by viewers were related to their feelings about either candidate or about the way in which the message was delivered
224520 however we do know that the ad did not move voters and they expressed negative emotions after viewing the ad
224521 but in the unlikely story that is america there has never been anything false about hope
224522 american voters oppose same sex marriage and they dont want to recognize same sex marriages performed in other states but by a narrow margin they dont want their states to ban it
224523 and they dont want to amend the constitution on this issue
224524 given a range of choices they divide into thirds for gay marriage for civil unions for a complete ban
224525 hazel wants to stay within sports and explore other opportunities
224526 u2 always felt it would be pathetic to be good at the music and bad at the business
224527 i think its part of the artists responsibility quite honestly and artists who arent interested in that are going to find it harder to reach an audience
224528 artists and managers who have their wits about them are now doing things for themselves that were historically done by record companies
224529 the business model that i expect to see develop in the future will be in partnership with the isps where they effectively become revenue collection partners for rights owners its a pity that they have preferred to sell broadband subscriptions as fast as they possibly can without observing their responsibilities to the content owners but there are encouraging signs that they are waking up
224530 some music will be heard on services where the revenue comes from advertisers it wouldnt suit the clients that i manage but the future will be multi platform and artists will have to embrace that if they want to be successful
224531 i dont have nostalgia for the way things were more music is being made and listened to than ever before and the multiple platforms provided by streaming services digital downloads and physical products should make it a more interesting world it is certainly more complex but the opportunities are greater than ever
224532 we were pretty suspicious of greatest hits which were usually premature and had no artist input and often signalled the end of a bands career we felt it was the bands responsibility to compile and order its own catalogue and these albums should be every bit as much part of their canon of work as a regular album
224533 we have treated it as an opportunity not a chore
224534 i do not expect the cd to disappear in my lifetime but i think artists and record companies have to put more effort into it otherwise why would people want one over a download
224535 the artwork surrounding the release of new music from an artist that youre interested in is in many ways just as interesting as the music i can remember when carrying a 12 inch lp down the street was almost an expression of the kind of person you were every bit as significant as what you wore or how you cut your hair these things evolve but i think the industry as a whole is missing the opportunity to produce the digital visual coefficient of an album sleeve and watch this space because its something u2 are addressing on their next album
224536 the only people who think music isnt free any more are the record companies
224537 it disturbs me greatly when i hear quite sensible people talking about the end of copyright i think copyright is part of civilisation and wed be very foolish indeed to accept the proposal that it is now a redundant concept
224538 i think key to all this is going to be co operation and revenue sharing with the isps and once that principle is accepted you will get better quality music legally and pay a reasonable price for it
224539 creightons sports information staff continues to prove that you dont need a big staff to provide great media service
224540 the bluejays were involved in hosting more mvc championships than any other school last year and were deeply entrenched in the ncaa mens basketball 1st 2nd round and college world series the creighton sid staff didnt miss a beat and didnt sleep much the award is well deserved
224541 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
224542 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
224543 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
224544 according to initial estimates there have been more than 260 civilian casualties in july of this year higher than any other month in the past six years
224545 the increased number of air strikes by international military forces which are up by approximately 40 per cent on last year has also contributed to the rising civilian death toll
224546 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north north west and central afghan istan including to provinces close to and bordering kabul
224547 the humanitarian challenge in afghanistan continues to grow in the past six months alone criminal gangs have attacked 12 un humanitarian convoys resulting in the loss of food for thousands of the poorest families
224548 the overall view is that we are seeing more violence but pretty much in the same places some times it expands into new areas but when it does it tends to be temporary
224549 we have gone from 30 000 to 50 000 troops and we are generating more activity because we are taking on the insurgents
224550 a large proportion of the violence has been caused by cross border activity
224551 this year it has become even easier for the insurgents to move across the border from pakistan which they are able to use as a safe haven
224552 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
224553 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
224554 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
224555 all of that stuff is sealed we have nothing we can talk about
224556 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
224557 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
224558 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
224559 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
224560 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
224561 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
224562 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
224563 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes
224564 firstview has made great progress in addressing two rapidly growing underserved markets with over 400 000 prepaid debit cards issued last year and a steady stream of enterprises signing up for its online bill payment and related services
224565 whats different about firstview is that the company utilizes in house processing capabilities employing leading edge technologies to serve both the issuing and acquiring sectors of the transaction processing industry
224566 cherie brings exactly the experience we need to put our operation in overdrive and exceed market expectations
224567 having a ceo with significant leadership experience in payment processing market expansion and mergers amp acquisitions should ignite firstviews opportunity in the market i am now able to focus on my strong suits of developing new market solutions strategically expanding our existing products and developing the long term strategy of the company

224581 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
224582 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had
224583 when the police barged into my parents house my mother asked them why do you confiscate my property what reason do you have and they said because you practice falun gong there are no reasons this is reason enough so i think todays police are very evil we cultivate falun gongs truth compassion and forbearance how can that be a threat to society
224584 after the chinese communist party started to persecute falun gong i was worried and sad every day my parents suffered so much as a result of the persecution since july 20 1999 they havent had a day of freedom
224585 today we remember the practitioners who have been persecuted to death my heart feels heavy because after so many years i still dont know if my brother is alive or not we tried so many ways and still cant find him
224586 the chinese government is afraid of falun gong there is no country government or association in the world that is afraid of a group of people that believe in truth compassion and forbearance why is the ccp so afraid because it is bad itself
224587 deshalb w ge und w hle genau wer verantwortung f r das land zu vergeben hat wem er sie anvertrauen kann und wem nicht

224595 after taking a few different exams and mris this morning the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
224596 there are so many mixed feelings because last night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious but after the tests this morning for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem but on the other hand this is something that needs a lot of time to heal
224597 there isnt a perfect solution to this but packers president mark murphy is at least trying
224598 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end

224608 apologies have been expressed in the indaba discussion groups by some of the episcopal church who had no idea that their action in the consecration of the current bishop of new hampshire had caused such a negative impact in many parts of the communion
224609 while there is a desire to end the spiral of chaos around this issue there appears to be no desire to be so decisive at this stage that anyone would want to walk away
224610 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church
224611 it is felt in some provinces as a betrayal of the teaching of the missionaries who brought the faith and it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
224612 decisive action if your eye cause offence pluck it out

224618 there is a long standing principle in international law that heads of state enjoy immunity from prosecution but that immunity is limited to other national courts to domestic jurisdiction in other countries so a head of state cannot be prosecuted while he is serving in office in another state
224619 but there is a long standing tradition in international law that international tribunals do not have to give immunity to head of states
224620 the government of sudan should deliver the suspect to the court but no one expects that to happen as sudan has not cooperated so far with the arrest warrants that have been issued for two other much more junior people
224621 all heads of government have got immunity this was actually through an initiative by president eisenhower a long time ago and his argument was that heads of government travel to solve problems that is why immunity is important for them
224622 the court statute itself provides a way out if a particular court process is detrimental to a particular peace process article 16 of the statute says that the security council on behalf of the international community can ask the court to stop proceedings for a year

224631 we know what it is like to hear the words your child has cancer
224632 but what we also learned is that in addition to excellent medical care children and families dealing with childhood cancer need other types of support as well
224633 we are extremely grateful for the grass roots support that was offered by maria and ken prechtl and their family and friends
224634 what does it take to motivate your heart patients to change their unhealthy habits
224635 telling people all about the benefits of exercise without helping them change their mindset toward the exercise is like putting children on a bike for the first time with no training wheels they will crash
224636 our goal is to raise enough money to fund research find an answer and put them out of business
224637 we all had been very lucky in life and in business

224663 we understand the stress and anxiety that these families face were hoping the care packages can take some of the focus off the circumstances of the birth and give the family back a little bit of the normalcy that other parents experience
224664 these families have an unexpected birth and have to travel to hospitals outside the area in springfield boston and albany n y
224665 these families may not be ready for a child who was born at 20 weeks and weighs about a pound they often havent had time to get these items for their new child
224666 these are places that serve emergency needs or are the initial contact for families in need

224712 jesus is going to be with those who feel the waterlessness of their position with those traditionalists feeling the church is slipping away from them the landmarks have shifted
224713 he will be with those in very different parts of the landscape who feel that things are closing in that their position is under threat and their liberties are being taken away by those anxious and eager to enforce new ideologies in the name of christ
224714 he will be with those who feel that their liberty of questioning is under threat he will be with gay clergy who wonder what their future is in a church so anxious and tormented about this issue

224734 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
224735 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil

224773 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
224774 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
224775 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
224776 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
224777 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
224778 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
224779 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
224780 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
224781 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
224782 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
224783 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be

224859 i believe that if this prayer for unity is going to be realized it will be realized through the catholic church the catholic church has retained the charism of unity protestantism will never experience unity until it deals with the very principle which is endemic to protestantism and that is if you disagree separate the catholic church is like a wise mother whenever a new charism arises within it it creates a religious order and keeps it in the church

224873 we are morally bound in good conscience to choose government leaders who will serve the common good the first priority of the common good is the protection of human life the basis of all other social conditions
224874 for the sake of common good we must safeguard the good of human life and the good of marriage and family life
224875 although war and capital punishment can rarely be justified they are not intrinsically evil
224876 you need to take these principles to the party so your loyalty is to the church not the party
224877 some things always and everywhere are wrong other things involve principles that should be applied but faithful catholics can come up with two different positions
224878 some people want to just throw up their hands and say its too hard theres not a perfect candidate no one agrees fully with catholic social thought but the archbishop makes a very clear case that its not a good excuse for choosing not to participate

224884 ive tried every which way to stay as close as possible to the original eudora which ive been using for years have tried some replacements but nothing has come close and most even wouldnt properly import my eudora mailboxes of which i have hundreds
224885 so ive stuck with eudora 6 2 4 mac os 10 4 11 and havent even dared update my system for fear of losing the use of my beloved eudora it is as close to perfect as any email application ive ever seen
224886 for me the main thing is that the original eudora mailbox structure be respected by odysseus or at least importable without glitches into odysseus this structure is extremely easy to back up every day which is a vital consideration it also allows me to use eudora on different machines at home and office and just transfer the office mailboxes over to home and vice versa on a usb key never seen an email program that allows that with so much ease as the classic eudora does
224887 mac users might find this interface to be more like mac eudora
224888 the penelope projects intention is to join the eudora user experience with the mozilla platform we intend to produce a version of eudora that is open source and based on mozilla and thunderbird its not our intention to compete with thunderbird rather we want to complement it
224889 we are committed to both preserving the eudora user experience and to maintaining maximum compatibility for both developers and users with thunderbird it is our goal to build a single development community around thunderbird and eudora so that both mailers advance faster than they previously have
224890 omg that would be amazing because i would be the first hip hop dancer to win the show i could move out to la and live my dream as a dancer singer i also want to make my family happy because they know i can do it and they believe in me
224891 i feel winning the show would provide an excellent base to explore lifes options who would have ever thought that a guy from montgomery al could be named americas favorite dancer it means no matter how far fetched something may sound if you want it badly enough it could happen
224892 i dont think i would believe it to win the show would be a dream come true we are all hungry for it but we are all winners we have grown not just as dancers but as people too
224893 winning the show would be the most unreal and amazing feat just being able to say i was part of season four and amongst so many amazing dancers and choreographers is a prize in itself all of the memories i have made makes it feel like i have already won something

224942 besides adequate compensation for the injured women the party would also demand punishment for police officials involved in the incidents
224943 we will also persuade the women parliamentarians to visit jammu and see for themselves the prevailing situation
224944 women are coming out on the streets because of anger against those who have hurt the religious sentiments by revoking the amarnath land tranfer order

224952 its very important to remember that what we have is a one off inflation brought on by costs going up and not a demand pull which means that for next year for example the numbers will not be repeated
224953 based on fundamentals and this is inclusive of the demand from india and china with their growing middle class population the price of oil should be between us 100 and us 120 per barrel
224954 we need to make sure that we grow enough to have food for our own use
224955 talks are still in the early stage we have to verify the volumes as well as to find out the types of ships that will be using the facility nevertheless we are prepared to build it
224956 its important to make port klang a gateway to malaysia being nearest to europe bound shipments if we dont make it now we stand to lose to vietnam and in in the next 20 to 30 years india as well as africa
224957 the momentum is going strong and there are no signs of slowing down
224958 the joint offerers also note that the shares have been thinly traded and trading volume has been low
224959 the new investors are expected to locate their operations at the bayan lepas free industrial zone on the island
224960 the medical firm is expected to invest rm150 million initially and hire 300 workers while the electronics based firm is looking at investing rm1 2 billion here
224961 the performance of the restaurant has so far been very encouraging we have also received good review from the local newspaper
224962 we expect jommakan outlets in these countries to be operational before end of 2009
224963 it will ensure the rapid growth of the franchise industry and acts as a benchmark for the franchise fraternity
224964 the blueprint will facilitate efforts to expedite the franchise industry in a more systematic manner
224965 i have been monitoring the market for the past 30 years and although the market is in a difficult time right now it is still better than it was in 1997 and 1987 when investors took out money from pnb every month
224966 i am still positive about the market because past scenarios were more difficult where the market went bust at that time
224967 our first shipment of steel bars worth rm6 million is stuck in singapore because the customs department insists that the steel bar grade of british standard 4449 does not match their computerised malaysia standard 146
224968 how many small and medium sized contractors can afford to pay rm4 000 per tonne for steel bars we decided to import but now the shipment is stuck in singapore how are we going to meet project deadlines for every one day delay weve to pay penalties
224969 the bii transaction had been scheduled for completion on july 31 unfortunately completion did not take place because according to maybank there was no bank negaras approval for the transaction
224970 sirims efforts throughout the years have boosted the image of made in malaysia products for their quality safety and reliability thus facilitating their entry into overseas markets
224971 sirim is also collaborating with several renowned international research amp technology organisations including the global research alliance gra
224972 enhancing capability of hydro generator and extending power supply to larger areas to support post harvest processing activities of local herbs
224973 this is indeed a great opportunity for malaysian products to penetrate the market
224974 the five centres have become referral points both domestically and internationally
224975 it is for maybank to resolve their problems these are normal problems that occur in merger and acquisition deals im sure they are capable enough to resolve this issue
224976 once the rules change and backdated to cover maybank they have a right to look at it again as a regulator they have to look at it on a macro basis
224977 we havent seen demand destruction in the sense of demand being reduced that wont then expand again at a lower price
224978 because of the underperformance of non opec supply versus expectations and the health of non oecd demand prices below us 120 arent justified
224979 people do adjust behavior to high prices but as prices fall back demand recovers to a higher level

224983 asian hedge fund investors reacted to continuing market volatility by adjusting allocations opportunistically to those regional markets that had posted sharp year to date losses
224984 generally whats happening is that the large institutional managers with respectable numbers are still seeing inflows but the smaller managers are seeing almost nothing
224985 smaller managers that have poor numbers such as many of those focusing on china and india have in fact seen substantial outflows
224986 now that returns are moderating and the sector has matured somewhat the survey reveals that investors are going to be more exacting
224987 with the usfig falling to a new 71 month low underlying inflationary pressures are in a decisive cyclical downswing
224988 typically we see most savings made in our energy efficiency programmes are through the effective application of successful practices technology and economics for example capturing carbon dioxide means it can be stored sequestered this comes at a cost however there are novel ways you can recycle carbon dioxide
224989 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy
224990 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
224991 we have about 60 mhz of spectrum available with us
224992 the number of operators can go up to 10 in the circles when more spectrum becomes available
224993 we werent really affected by the subprime crisis and global inflation problems
224994 we expect profit to be higher also due to new products being launched after we acquired gateway
224995 instead of the end of may we shipped at the end of june
224996 delivery this month was very very good we also have a big plan for august
224997 lavora come se non avessi bisogno dei soldi ama come se nessuno ti abbia mai fatto soffrire balla come se nessuno ti stesse guardando canta come se nessuno ti stesse sentendo
224998 we have about 40 000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on the remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called dna methylation
224999 interestingly the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse and this fits with depression
225000 the whole idea that the genome is so malleable in the brain is surprising finding that epigenetic mechanisms continue to influence gene expression is pretty unusual
225001 these observations open an entirely new avenue of research and potential therapeutic interventions

225074 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
225075 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
225076 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
225077 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision

225097 ive maybe had that question once in the past five years
225098 we worked on various set up options for the car i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail the situation is not too bad the car handles better but our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race
225099 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition but clearly they are very quick i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface we know in which direction we have to work and we will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident all the same
225100 we come here off the back of two rather difficult races and our target here has to be to extract the full potential of our package and then try to secure the best possible result fridays results always have to be looked at with caution especially at a track like the hungaroring which is always very dirty on the first day clearly we are up against some very strong opposition on a track where historically we have usually struggled a bit but i am confident we can have a good race
225101 fridays results are always difficult to evaluate as one doesnt know what fuel loads the other teams are running and this is even more the case here in budapest where the tyres show signs of a lot of graining on the first day in fact only the performance over the first lap can be considered a valid indication before waiting several laps before the tyres clean up again and one can return to showing an acceptable pace we got through all our planned programme and the new parts we have brought here seem to be working in the right direction now we have to analyse the date to be as well prepared as possible for the rest of the weekend
225102 in the beginning it wasnt good at all i guess many drivers had trouble with graining so i dont think i was the only one but i found the balance of my car really poor we made several changes during both sessions but they didnt lead to the progress we wanted for the very last outing we then made major changes and luckily this proved to be a step in the right direction im happy we tried this because we now know a lot more
225103 we did the usual friday programme we evaluated the tyre compounds and worked on the cars set up in order to find out how the car and the tyres behave on this track we will now analyse todays data and prepare for saturday
225104 it was a productive first day of practice as usual we concentrated on race preparation the focus was on the tyre selection in budapest the two softest tyre compounds will be used now we are going to analyse the data we have collected this will be the base for our race strategy
225105 our free practice programme went well and we have made progress the car was reacting well to the different set up solutions that we tried and so i am quite satisfied with the days work the track changed a lot during the day and its quite a demanding place with lots of corners but i enjoyed driving the circuit and i hope things continue like this tomorrow
225106 it was a typical day of practice with a lot of laps covered and lots of data to analyse this evening to be ready for tomorrow overall we improved the car and we are moving in the right direction we still have a few things to improve but if we can make the most of the final free practice session tomorrow morning we should be able to approach qualifying in good shape
225107 it was a very productive first day here in hungary on this circuit where qualifying is particularly important its no secret that our fuel load was slightly lower than normal but even so we look competitive our main focus was to understand the tyres and in particular the effect of graining all in all it was a successful day for us
225108 this is a track we know well and so our main focus today was to concentrate on the setup of the cars there were not any problems which allowed us to make good progress with our programme and the results from the first day of practice are rather encouraging its difficult to know exactly where we are relative to our competitors because the impact of carrying fuel here is significant but it was important to complete our programme which we have done
225109 we didnt start the day quite the way we wanted and had to make several changes throughout the sessions in order to find the best direction for us we definitely went the right way with the changes and have made some good progress with the car tyre wise we have yet to make our decision its not immediately clear which option to go for but well analyse that tonight once again the competition is looking quite strong especially the renaults
225110 our pace wasnt where we wanted it to be in the morning session so we made a few changes in the break between sessions the changes worked better for us as we certainly found some more pace in the afternoon we still have some work to do this evening to make sure we get the best from the car tomorrow i also know that i have to do some work to improve my pace as well
225111 a busy day for the team during which we worked through a number of set up changes on both cars throughout the course of practice the main area that we have to focus on here is qualifying its almost impossible to overtake around the hungaroring so a good qualifying position is key to a successful result on sunday the drivers and engineers will now spend tonight working through the set up to get more performance out of the car
225112 weve got some work to do tonight to try and work out where we can find some more pace in the car we had a good run in terms of laps completed but it would always be nice to be a bit quicker well be back tomorrow and will do our best
225113 a normal friday for us today making our tyre comparisons and getting used to the conditions i think its going to be very tight again in the mid group but well see how tomorrow goes
225114 as usual here in hungary it was a difficult friday because of the dusty circuit it was hard to draw clear conclusions because there was tyre graining that affected the cars performance and general balance so we concentrated on finding out what kind of behaviour we can expect from the tyres i hope we can have another strong weekend because i like this track the car has been competitive recently and we are looking to score more points
225115 the morning went well for me on the dirty track surface and we had no problems with the car in the second session the track changed there was a bit more grip and the car started to be a bit trickier to drive but overall this was not a bad first day hopefully we can continue with this speed if i can qualify well and we can have the race pace we had in hockenheim then a points finish should be possible after my accident in the last race ive completely recovered i tested at jerez last week without problems i passed a further medical check yesterday and i felt fine driving the car today
225116 todays sessions went very smoothly and we were able to get through a lot of work on aerodynamics and set up we had no problems on the cars so that was a positive day for us obviously here you always have to be very careful with the circuit evolution because the track starts dirty and then picks up a lot of rubber this needs to be taken into account when we do our analysis tonight the option tyre seemed better suited to the track compared to friday last year and we can be pleased with what we have achieved today
225117 not too bad today this morning was the first time i have driven here since the track configuration was changed so i was finding out what its like in a formula 1 car that went okay this afternoon it was the usual programme of evaluating the tyres with different fuel loads the track rubbered in quite a lot towards the end and as i did low fuel runs earlier in the session this did not show in our later lap times i was struggling a bit on the option which i had expected as this track changes a lot if you dont have a major problem with the car its best to leave it alone and see what happens on the second day otherwise you make changes to the car which are not appropriate for the saturday conditions you have to be patient
225118 i had hydraulic problems in both sessions a shame because i lost a lot of track time and fridays work is very important i hardly ran at all and therefore we are lacking information which will be a handicap for the rest of the weekend obviously this means the data from the other car will be twice as important as usual i will try and learn from sebastien but relying on your team mate is never as good as finding your own way around the track hopefully i can catch up a bit tomorrow morning
225119 overall we had a good day today which enabled us to further understand the new rear suspension that we will be racing for the first time this weekend we made some positive changes after the morning session to improve the car as i was not happy with the balance when we had very low grip at both ends the changes ensured that the car was a lot more responsive this afternoon and an improvement over how it has felt for much of this season our long run pace is looking okay but we have further work to do over one lap as the balance is not quite there yet
225120 it has been a challenging day today which we expected as we continue the set up work with our revised rear suspension and new aero parts once the track had improved this morning we worked on getting the right balance on the car and conditioning the tyres unfortunately we struggled with understeer and we need to look at the data closely this evening to confirm our direction before qualifying as the lack of overtaking opportunities here makes it important to get a good grid slot
225121 this is always a demanding circuit for the brakes and engine due to the high ambient temperatures and low average speed we also need to be mindful of the fact that we are expecting an equally hot weekend in valencia in three weeks time therefore engine management will be particularly important here the nature of this circuit calls for the bridgestone soft and super soft tyre compounds with which we will need to maintain a balance to prevent graining and overheating beyond that the heat will make this a tough race for the drivers however ours are well prepared for these conditions we have introduced some significant mechanical developments to the car this weekend as well as the final stage of our mid season aerodynamic upgrade whilst we have a tangible improvement in terms of stability and improved grip in the high speed corners the developments have produced some significantly different characteristics and we are still developing the set up of the car around these we have some way to go to achieve the optimum balance and this is reflected in the timesheets today
225122 the upshift is better with the new gearbox and obviously a good step forward but unfortunately for us we are not going to use it tomorrow and sunday we are struggling with the grip level at the moment as there is a lot of inconsistency and the balance is not quite there over the day the track conditions did improve a lot and the last 10 to 15 minutes of the second session were much better lets see for tomorrow and how it improves again as we use it more
225123 quite a good day today the gearbox did a good job and we didnt have any issues at all the car balance was still difficult as the track is not yet at its best so it was hard to find a good set up on my last run i had some traffic and couldnt really get the maximum out of it but i have a good feeling all the same i think we are on the right track and the car is behaving well with no problems i hope we can translate this into a good performance tomorrow in qualifying
225124 it was good to use the seamless shift box on both cars today and we ran without any problems we also ran some updated parts for the high downforce configuration and didnt have any mechanical issues we are just trying to understand the tyres obviously the track evolves throughout the day and the event and was very dirty to start with which caused a lot of graining on the tyres overall we got through our whole programme of work and i think we can have a good weekend for tomorrow well be reverting back to the standard gearbox configuration as its the fourth race of this boxs cycle but well be using the seamless shift in valencia
225125 the track was very dusty this morning so we took our time before starting our run programme once again the car felt good even though i encountered quite a lot of traffic during both sessions this afternoon i also got to try the revised aero package for the first time it definitely seemed to make the car better balanced which is very encouraging
225126 another positive day for us the car started the day pretty strongly but we were able to keep improving it throughout both sessions this afternoon i was able to find a particularly good balance and focused on conserving the tyres rather than going for a lap time i had a little bit of graining but things look very promising for tomorrow
225127 today we ran two more or less trouble free sessions save for a few traffic issues this morning which arent unusual on this circuit having said that those traffic issues werent sufficient to disrupt our programme unduly the aero package weve developed for this race appears to have delivered the predicted results and the performance of the car is encouraging so far
225128 a good and constructive start to the weekend we simulated race conditions and both lewis and heikki posted fast and consistent lap times with more rubber on the asphalt the conditions will change tomorrow so it is too early to judge precisely where we are compared to the competition

225285 the americans have all along known about the isis collaboration with the taliban they knew the political leadership of the taliban including mullah omar were in quetta they knew when jalaluddin haqqani was in pakistan earlier it didnt suit their interest to admit this but now that the fellows trained to fight in kashmir are fighting in afghanistan and killing american soldiers theyre feeling the heat
225286 weve been shouting this from the rooftops for years now given the situation in afghanistan there is growing frustration within the u s about pakistans two timing but theres no telling whether this is a one off scolding or will translate into longer term action hopefully there will be more trouble for the isi ahead

225301 affirmative action is in the eye of the beholder i dont think the quota system has helped anyone
225302 i do have some idea of what its like to be deprived of your rights
225303 das hat viel damit zu tun dass es flache strecken sind
225304 auf solchen kursen hatten wir in der vergangenheit eine menge erfolg mir kam es so vor als habe ich nur zwei runden gebraucht um die strecke entdeckt zu haben und wenn du dort einmal ein rennen gewonnen hast dann hast du ein gef hl daf r was notwendig ist um in deinem auto ein rennen zu gewinnen du bekommst ein gef hl daf r
225305 so wie im juni qualifying und rennen liefen sollten wir ein starkes auto haben das mit den richtigen nderungen in den top 10 landen kann und ich sehe keinen grund warum wir nicht wieder eine siegchance haben sollen
225306 die n chsten sechs rennen sind alles strecken auf denen wir gut ausgesehen haben wenn wir keine crashes bauen dann sollten wir eine chance auf den chase haben
225307 wir sagen niemals nie und wir werden bis zum ende k mpfen wir haben in pocono immer gut ausgesehen

225312 everyone thinks its three people six months and you make millions of dollars
225313 if we had been a little company peggle would have been a failure most developers would have given up after three months
225314 the possibility of your doing well is really really low regardless of how well your games sell youre not going to make a lot of money
225315 relatively speaking we are seeing fewer sales than we should be seeing
225316 theyve been reinforcing a particular type of player and consumer one whos not in the habit of trying out new types of game play
225317 will end up moving on to the next shiny light
225318 i think the smart companies can still differentiate themselves and offer higher quality games and do a better job at building brands the cream will rise to the top
225319 please chop off my hair and fix my jacked up bangs that some how were cut crooked not sure how that happened
225320 together with nomination of a new independent chief executive who would assemble the new management team and new independent directors to be added to the board of tnk bp the parity at the subsidiary board level is one of our proposals for change

225322 tear up the agreement that they willingly signed in 2003
225323 weve had enough of inspections and all sorts of raids our law enforcement and state institutions should stop terrifying business
225324 we need to have an appropriate investment climate in this country and this should be a goal for all those present here including government officials in general the law enforcement agencies and the business community
225325 we need to be in a world where we can say that keeping kosher is the way in which i demonstrate not only a concern for my relationship to god and torah but the jewish concern for our relationship to the world in which we live
225326 as soon as 2010 iran will have the option to reach uranium production at military levels

225329 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
225330 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level
225331 we believe we have the suspect we have been looking for all night
225332 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system a growing credit crunch we need to do more
225333 do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies
225334 you cant afford to wait for relief right now people are suffering
225335 we agreed that the main risk we face today is doing too little in the face of our growing economic troubles
225336 they want a serious conversation about the challenges we face
225337 its time we used some of their record profits to help you pay record prices
225338 with american families and small businesses facing record high gasoline prices congress has adjourned to leave washington for a five week break the message this sends to the american people is bad enough its ramifications however are far worse you have the power to call congress back into session at any moment to deal with issues of urgent national importance
225339 no one can argue that the issue of high energy costs and their impact on american families does not rise to this level that is why we write today to request that you call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act h r 6566 such an action will ensure our nations energy crisis receives the attention and action it deserves
225340 it is well past time for congress to lift the ban on environmentally safe exploration for oil and gas on the outer continental shelf and act on other critical reforms to increase production of american energy and lower the price of gasoline
225341 we should not wait until september to do so and frankly we should not wait another day to do so congress should not take the next five weeks off while the american people suffer at the pump we respectfully request that you schedule a vote on the comprehensive american energy act during an emergency legislative session this month
225342 as an artist you actually do have to make a choice to be an outsider if youre an outsider you have the freedom to say what people on the inside dont dare to say

225346 defense attorneys have objected for years that mr kromberg the lead counsel in many of these cases has been using the eastern district of virginia to mete out his own brand of justice for muslim terrorism subjects often openly displaying his personal animus
225347 this long and controversial record forms the backdrop for the allegation of selective and malicious prosecution in this case
225348 they can kill each other during ramadan they can appear before the grand jury all they cant do is eat before sunset
225349 all part of the attempted islamization of the american justice system
225350 such arrangements typically appeal to people harboring strong doubts about the stability of the international monetary system and who believe they are insulating their wealth from a global collapse by tying it to the value of gold
225351 without realizing it we created green eyes as a form of collective catharsis for those who feel like theyre drowning in their relationships and cant get any perspective for those who narrowly escaped a destructive relationship they still somehow miss for those who narrowly escaped a destructive relationship and somehow dont miss it at all for those who try to find love in the 21st century
225352 the u s was thinking of flying u2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over iraq painted in u n colours
225353 if saddam fired on them he would be in breach
225354 the executives current claim of absolutely immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without support in the case law
225355 despite the bush administrations view the president is not above the law nor are his advisors
225356 todays opinion affirms fundamental ideas about the limits of executive power within our constitutional system
225357 if we really believe in california then we must fight for it i am prepared to lead that fight
225358 i know how to bring people to the table and solve problems thats because ive worked every part of the problem solving equation as a legislator state insurance commissioner deputy interior secretary under president clinton and as lieutenant governor
225359 it is with great enthusiasm that i endorse john garamendi for governor
225360 for the past thirty years john has and continues to be a champion for californias underserved populations during his tenure in the california legislature he led the fight for universal healthcare which demonstrates his vision and commitment to improve the quality of life for all californians
225361 more recently john successfully facilitated over 45 million dollars in grants and loans for community clinics infrastructure through the wellpoint anthem merger that is why i know john has the vision and leadership to be a great governor in 2010
225362 i developed a universal healthcare plan in 1991 that sparked the debate nationally and statewide negotiated the headwaters compact in 1998 built the workers compensation plan called
225363 the data show that how and where we live can greatly affect our health
225364 we have the opportunity using evidence based data on community design to create neighborhoods that encourage less car driving benefiting residents health and wallets and shrinking our own carbon footprint
225365 neighborhoods with higher fractions of residents that walk to work tell us that something beneficial about the neighborhood is promoting health
225366 we expect these results mean that residents find walking more attractive and enjoyable where there are other walkers a variety of destinations easily accessible by foot and pedestrian friendly street networks people want to walk when its pleasant convenient and when there is a destination
225367 we are honored to be selected by the ocean foundation as the service provider for the restoration of damaged seagrass meadows as part of this vital project the first if its kind
225368 not only are seagrass meadows critically important to marine life and the overall health of our nations coastlines but play an important role in the battle against climate change
225369 the ocean foundation is pleased to work alongside seagrass recovery as we repair seagrass beds so that marine life is able to continue to thrive and prosper
225370 because of the ocean foundations commitment to the worlds oceans we felt especially drawn to this project and we are excited about all that will be achieved through the generous donations of corporations and individuals it is our philosophy that only by working together can we improve the bodies of water worldwide for generations to come
225371 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
225372 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
225373 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
225374 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
225375 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
225376 the scientific community is really going to run with this
225377 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
225378 more than half of the worlds poorest people live in countries rich in natural resources access to information is a fundamental aspect of development
225379 senator schumer has taken an important step to provide citizens with vital information to hold their governments accountable for how mining and oil projects will impact their lives and lands and how revenues can contribute to the long term reduction of poverty
225380 it is no secret that lack of transparency in the extractive industry often goes hand in hand with government corruption and internal conflict the industry suffers as a result with company investments at risk and higher energy prices for consumers
225381 this legislation would foster accountability in nations where secrecy has undermined development democracy and human rights
225382 mandatory revenue disclosure has the power to weed out corruption in developing countries making way for stability and real solutions to poverty that the oil gas and mining industries can support
225383 this legislation is an opportunity for the united states to take leadership in the international community
225384 revenue disclosure will give communities the tools they need to have a say in how extractive projects affect their lands and livelihoods if communities know how much extractive companies are paying their governments for natural resources they can advocate for a fair share of the benefits to address community needs like education health care and jobs
225385 these new data add to the growing body of evidence that investing in publicly funded contraceptive services can make an enormous impact on helping women reduce unintended pregnancies abortions and unplanned births all while saving money
225386 investing in a prevention strategy is more important now than ever as the number of women who need publicly funded contraceptive services has increased by more than one million since 2000
225387 the impact of publicly funded family planning clinic services on unintended pregnancies and government cost savings
225388 todays action ensures that californians will continue to reap the benefits of one of the fastest cheapest cleanest ways to meet our energy needs namely energy efficiency
225389 part of the genius of californias energy policy is that utilities must use energy efficiency as the first energy resource to meet demand before building more power plants or purchasing additional energy from fossil fuel sources this is a tried and true method
225390 the public utilities commission under the leadership of commissioner grueneich should be commended for making the most of this highly effective tool
225391 to empower locals and provide additional tactics to pressure warren buffetts pacificorp to remove the lower four klamath river dams
225392 weve been campaigning hard for five years and still the company refuses to take responsibility for the dams destruction of our fishery and communities
225393 these workshops are meant to get new blood from different walks of life to engage in direct action in our campaign to remove pacificorps klamath dams
225394 they are being held to prepare for the nonviolent direct action camp that will be conducted in orleans from august 22 to 24
225395 to empowering a new generation of young native leaders emerging across the continent who are bringing innovation creativity and inspiration to struggles to keep their homelands from becoming wastelands
225396 we dont want a lack of tactics or tools to slow down our effort to restore the klamath
225397 we have invited ip3 here to add some creativity to our campaign and help us think strategically about how to influence people like warren buffett
225398 as a european american you are the visitor in our country will you not meet with the native people impacted by your fish killing dams
225399 you say you want to address poverty and disease in the third world but you are creating those same third world conditions right here in america we want to meet and resolve the issue in a way that saves you money and saves our culture
225400 disrupting the shareholders meeting of the richest man on earth was very empowering
225401 i think that now its time for tribes fishermen and communities to all join together to let buffett know that as long as there is no business as usual on the klamath there will be no business as usual for berkshire hathaway or pacificorp either
225402 i really enjoyed going to the protest in omaha a lot of eyes were opened by our presence at the shareholders meeting
225403 we dont have a lot of time left the river is already low shallow and warm and every day the blue green algae on the river gets a little worse
225404 when i go to crescent city and other towns along the coast my heart goes out to the fishermen whose boats are tied up at the dock because of the salmon closure we cant wait for 20 years to restore the river we dont have that time
225405 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
225406 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
225407 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
225408 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
225409 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
225410 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
225411 the department of energy must thoroughly consider all of the consequences of vastly expanding its uranium leasing and mining program in western colorado
225412 the federal government cannot blindly stumble along with this proposal which could permanently and irretrievably contaminate precious water soil and wildlife habitat
225413 the department of energy shouldnt gamble with the future of colorado communities rivers mountains and wildlife by rushing to approve such a large number of new uranium mines certainly without requiring adequate protections to prevent pollution
225414 we must avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and ensure that our water our environment and our people are protected from uranium pollution
225415 its deeply troubling that the federal government is spending our taxes planning new mining before contamination from past mining has been cleaned up
225416 local governments are taking a cautious approach to uranium mining near communities and public lands
225417 our federal government owes the same cautious approach for communities downstream from the national uranium leasing program particularly given its history
225418 we have succeeded in moving climate change to the top of the international agenda for action and this means that the un must take action itself
225419 a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity
225420 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first
225421 but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications
225422 this budget a budget that intends to bind the wounds of war and to care for those who have worn the nations uniform should never be used as a political lever to force policies of one branch of government on the other
225423 the move represents the port authoritys firm resolve to do what is necessary to advance the rebuilding process as quickly as possible
225424 were excited about where we are at this point recognizing that theres still a long road ahead of us before the day that st nicholas opens its doors again
225425 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
225426 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
225427 this recognition of service is an honor for me personally and for cmus excellent health administration degree programs
225428 i see this award as leading by example and modeling the kind of contributions to the profession we hope our students and graduates will emulate
225429 it is fitting that bernie kerr will be the first recipient of this award
225430 bernie founded our chapter he had a vision and he breathed life into it today we have 150 members who are sharing ideas and working to improve health care
225431 i believe this agreement is good for india and good for the world and for non proliferation
225432 the agreement is good for our collective efforts to move towards a world free from nuclear weapons the agreement brings india closer to the debate of our ultimate goal nuclear non proliferation treaty for establishing a world free from nuclear weapons
225433 we cant exclude from the debate india pakistan and israel and those remaining outside the npt these are countries which hold 20 per cent of the worlds population they have to be included
225434 i am looking forward that the nsg will give a waiver to india to carry out nuclear commerce
225435 around 300 million people are living on one dollar per day so we have to bridge the gap between the rich and poor to remove the imbalance
225436 i see this agreement from a bigger picture and i hope that it will reignite the debate on nuclear disarmament
225437 hopefully it will create an atmosphere of partnership and not isolation
225438 this will also lead to comprehensive moratorium on production of any nuclear materials for weapons purposes until fissile material control treaty comes into force
225439 to dream that you are sailing the high seas in a ship denotes that you are standing tall in times emotional turmoil
225440 to see a lake in your dream signifies your emotional state of mind if the lake is clear and calm then it symbolize your inner peace
225441 to see a house in your dream represents your own soul and self if the house is empty then it indicates feelings of insecurity
225442 to see a hotel in your dream signifies a new state of mind or a shift in personal identity you need to move away from your old habits and old way of thinking or you feel the need to temporarily escape from your daily life
225443 green signifies a positive change good health growth healing hope vigor vitality peace and serenity green is also symbolic of your strive to gain recognition and establish your independence money wealth and jealousy are often associated with this color
225444 to see your crush in your dream represents your current infatuation with him if you find yourself thinking about him during the day then it is understandable that his image will appear in your dream during the night if your dream that your crush rejects you refers to not knowing how he really feels about you and whether he likes you or not
225445 and thus may refer to your desire to be the center of attention consider how your stage performance parallels a waking situation
225446 it is reckless to approve a huge coal fired power plant with no global warming emission controls this one massive plant will negate the emissions reductions being implemented by the northeastern states in the first mandatory regional program to cut global warming pollution the administrations shameful decision rewards polluters flouts the clean air act and fails the american people
225447 marys long history of working with gun violence prevention groups her knowledge of the issues and her willingness to work as a volunteer lobbyist in congress made her appear to be a good choice for states uniteds legislative director
225448 unlike the nra which obviously has plenty of money to spend paying spies for years at a time states united relies heavily on dedicated volunteers to accomplish the work of the organization
225449 it is beyond my comprehension how someone could have listened to my story and expressed desire to help prevent others from having to experience the agony i went through all the time collecting money as a gun lobby spy
225450 before the operation we had to describe to him that he would have to deal with the fact hed have somebody elses hands
225451 when he woke up he looked at his hands and went very good
225452 already the number of donors willing to donate their internal organs is declining
225453 on top of that it is more acceptable for people to have a relatives kidneys taken out than for them to have an entire leg hand or their face cut off
225454 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
225455 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
225456 good for india good for the world and for non proliferation
225457 i am deeply grieved to learn about the sad demise of harkishan singh surjeet veteran cpi m leader
225458 he always championed the cause of the farmers poor and the downtrodden and earned the admiration of the people for his dedication and sense of public service
225459 in his death the country has lost an eminent personality who was always sensitive to the social concerns of our times
225460 surjeet saheb was a great political leader a true patriot a man committed to the welfare of the downtrodden a great indian and above all a dear friend
225461 i greatly valued his friendship and his guidance he was one of the architects of the united progressive alliance upa
225462 harkishan singh surjeet dedicated his entire life to the communist movement in india under his leadership the communist movement came into the national mainstream and contributed to giving a progressive orientation to our social and economic policies
225463 harkishan singh surjeet devoted his life to the cause of the poor and the downtrodden and earned the admiration of the people for his dedication he was instrumental in forming the upa coalition government at the centre in his death the country has lost an eminent personality who always fought for social causes
225464 the benchmarks set by harkishan singh surjeet through his conduct sacrifices spartan life style and writings will inspire generations of politicians and the youth who want to enter public life
225465 he was a grassroots political leader and played a pioneering role in empowering the peasants in punjab as a leader of the communist party of india and later the communist party of india marxist he played a vital role in defining and shaping their role in the politics of the country for nearly seven decades
225466 his pivotal role in the formation of the united progressive alliance will be remembered for long
225467 he was suffering from quite some time and was not in a position to communicate i wanted to talk to him but he was hospitalized he was doyen of indian communist movement particularly prime minister president and myself admitted that he was the architecture of the united progressive alliance upa left coalition which was functioning well since the last four years
225468 you cant have your cake and eat it too except here

225470 sell out your family turn little suzy into gas money
225471 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
225472 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
225473 zet je hem aan de deur omdat je het niet eens bent dan komt hij binnen via het raam wijs je hem dan nog eens de deur dan komt hij terug door het kelderraam hij is onuitputtelijk
225474 mijn hartfalen was wel niet zo erg als eerst gedacht ik zou nou kunnen spelen maar de wens van mijn familie gaf de doorslag het is triest om zo te moeten stoppen ik wilde de maldini van psg zijn

225483 i had a lot of fun out there this morning
225484 surfing in the state titles amongst all this awesome competition you have to surf well
225485 i have had a pretty crazy year so far but to come back and surf in this event is really fun
225486 there are a heap of good guys surfing in this event so its fun to hang out and get some good waves but in saying that i still want to win
225487 it just goes to show how strong junior surfing is within nsw
225488 cannot be undone undo history will be lost ok to continue
225489 the tide is super low out there right now but these conditions really suit my surfing
225490 i think i managed to pick off the best waves in that heat and they really opened up for me and allowed me to perform im stoked to advance through round 2 and im looking forward to the rest of the event
225491 ive yet to really have a breakout result this season
225492 i feel like i have been building momentum the last two events though and the wave here in indo is one that i could really do well at i think the swell is supposed to pick up over the next few days and i hope it does game on
225493 no one wants to win heats that way but its a competition and thats how it goes sometimes
225494 i had a good start to the heat and then held priority for the back half i should have done my job a little better and stayed on him a bit closer towards the end and i would have been in better position to perform on that wave but that was my mistake and i had to take off anyway
225495 i lost a bit on skin on the reef on my elbow and my foot and my ass but it was worth it to get through the heat
225496 its so shallow out there this afternoon but i am very happy to advance through to round 3 the wave here is good for me on my forehand and i am hoping for a good result here
225497 did the pirates get one young impact player back in any deal
225498 my answer is no did they get an evan longoria type they could drop in the middle of their order
225499 the circumstantial evidence at this point is about as strong as it can be a whale known to be particularly vulnerable to sonar that has stranded all over the world following naval sonar and that has been found stranded in hawaii only about once every decade strands less than a day after sonar can be heard nearby we certainly hope the navy begins to take responsibility for its actions and adds mitigation measures as courts have repeatedly ordered it to do

225501 exxonmobil reported the largest profit on any corporation in u s history the second quarter of 2008
225502 giving them access to more domestic drilling means more oil for them to sell at the world market price with fewer costs to produce it the consumer doesnt see a cent
225503 the use of great apes for invasive research science policy welfare and current events
225504 this is a historic dialogue on the use of great apes in invasive research
225505 i look forward to discussing the urgent need to get all great apes out of labs and into sanctuaries with leading primatologists
225506 these case studies clearly illustrate the psychological toll that laboratory life takes on chimpanzees and how their suffering ethically challenges their use for invasive research which must come to an end
225507 dan komt vast te staan dat het onrechtmatig gekapt is
225508 dat is voor de toekomst van belang als opnieuw een onverlaat het in zijn hoofd haalt het bos te willen kappen ook kunnen wij dan de gemaakte kosten te verhalen
225509 maar wij denken dat hier andere krachten in het spel zijn dan alleen deze minister defensie wil nog steeds de rest van het bos laten kappen

225513 starting up the same sort of racially tinged attack on mr obama that republican operatives ran against harold ford
225514 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate

225519 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range
225520 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
225521 but under the laws that govern cleanup the navy is also required to implement practical historic preservation measures
225522 that comparison makes it easy for navy officials to recommend to their bosses stripping and coating over the demolition but it leaves historic mitigation unresolved
225523 a great example of how a community can work together to save a historic landmark
225524 how can i just get over it and move on
225525 why is it so hard to just forgive the person who abused me and get on with my life like everyone is telling me to do
225526 will god ever forgive me of my sin of being abused
225527 i received three different emails about this workshop when i read the third one i figured i was supposed to come

225535 as the pace of technology increases the amount of toxic electronic waste is piling up at home and abroad
225536 many americans are unaware that discarded electronics often contain lead mercury and other toxics and end up being salvaged under inhumane conditions in the developing world
225537 this resolution doesnt call for a ban on all exports just exports to the developing nations
225538 exporting e waste to the developed countries which have laws and governments that protect workers and the environment would still be allowed
225539 this plan will allow the company to emerge from bankruptcy in a manner that is fair to all constituencies and puts asarcos assets under ownership of a world class global mining company
225540 while we still need court approval of our plan we believe the end of this complex bankruptcy finally is in sight

225604 the pc market in the uk performed strongly this quarter with both the consumer and professional markets fuelling growth this strong performance can only be sustained if new users are being reached or existing users are buying additional pcs or replacing their old ones more rapidly
225605 a new generation of personal computers on the way from apple inc may sport some of the most significant architectural changes since the mac maker made the jump from powerpc processors to those manufactured by intel corp appleinsider has learned
225606 as part of its move to intel chips in early 2006 the cupertino based company largely abandoned its practice of using custom motherboard chipsets to support the primary cpu in its macs
225607 however with apple striving to maintain mac sales growth of more than two times the industry average its again looking to differentiate the architecture of its personal computer systems
225608 except its a waste of time and money worse its a losing strategy after all apple doesnt need to differentiate on silicon industrial design and software is enough to read why click through
225609 although once famously proud of annihilating its r amp d budget it appears dell is now in some cases reading from the book of apple in taking existing ideas and at least in some ways improving them in recent weeks weve seen the dell dock taking the ui device from os x thats loved and loathed in equal measure and adding handy auto categorization and yes im well aware apple didnt invent docks but if youve been paying attention thats kind of my point studio hybrid depicted is a rather more ballsy production not only taking on the mac mini and apple tv but exposing some of the shortcomings in apples range of highly consumer oriented desktop machines
225610 weve made it clear that our company and apple inc are not affiliated in any manner and anyone wishing to run mac os x is best advised to buy an authentic mac computer from an apple authorized retailer our computers are not mac clones and rsol pc does not market them as such we offer and recommend microsoft windows as the preferred operating system for our jive series because thats the only operating system we will be supporting through the products limited warranty we recognize the growing user interest in linux distributions like fedora or ubuntu so we offer to preinstall them also but the enduser is responsible for obtaining their own software support we are also not blind to the small group of folks that like to run osx86 but if they want to go out and run osx86 on our machine which its more than capable of doing then thats their own choice they just need to be aware and take full responsibility for essentially running a reverse engineered version of a copyrighted operating system they wont receive any software support from us and its unlikely they will receive any support from apple to be absolutely clear the illegal distribution and use of apples operating system is not something we encourage or endorse at rsol pc
225611 maybe that most recent e mail virus was the last straw
225612 for whatever reason youve decided to buy a new computer from apple and want a little help sorting out the different models
225613 from design to function from form to performance you pretty much cant go wrong with anything apple is currently selling weve tested them all in our labs over the past months and theyre just that good read on and well help you choose the right one
225614 as i write this i am awaiting the shipment of my third wireless mighty mouse courtesy of applecare in less than 16 months im betting most of you whove owned a mighty mouse wireless or not for over 6 months will know what my issue has been thats right the trackball it just stops working
225615 apple i agree that the mighty mouse especially the wireless one is an awesome idea and the ability to scroll horizontally is nothing short of bad ass but when i pay 70 for a mouse i expect it to last more than 6 months i feel especially sorry for those who purchased the mighty mouse separate from their macs thus leaving it uncovered by extended applecare
225616 the new standard includes all of the amendments enhancements and more than 100 errata which have been added to the base standard over the last 12 years

225644 mourned the loss of dr bruce ivins who served the institute for more than 35 years as a civilian microbiologist we will miss him very much
225645 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
225646 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
225647 wouldnt it be great if we could just take a pill instead of having to do this every day
225648 new york state and the united states are experiencing a downturn in the economy that is worse than the energy crisis of 30 years ago that is greater than the economic recession of 40 years ago and may yet be as challenging to the american population as even the great depression this crisis is as undeniable as it is dangerous
225649 we have to be smarter about money for too long governments have done less with more and paid more for less
225650 we are going to have to cut spending the time has come for america to cut up its credit cards
225651 there is no quick fix there is no silver bullet there is no painless way in which we can escape these consequences
225652 the federal government is going to have to put more into the states that support it in the next few years before we have what will be a national crisis of bankruptcy and perhaps further fiscal insolvency

225656 jtang what got you all fired up this morning what im stating and have stated seve
225657 it came to me that this woman loves and worships the same god i do
225658 i had this sharpened awareness that in that moment she was in touch with god just as i was it was a dawning and an awakening and it was liberating because it liberates you from standing on a pedestal and looking down on someone else
225659 beyond 9 11 christians and muslims together a new world vision
225660 is that we can find a way to bridge the chasm between christians muslims jews hindus and buddhists and make atlanta a model city that over the next year or two we can develop an interfaith immersion program
225661 a soft evangelical i ask questions and listen rather than telling people what they ought to do or believe
225662 im the most unlikely candidate for becoming a spokesperson about islam
225663 i wondered who i was now that i wasnt a teacher preacher traveler or speaker
225664 you get beneath the dogma and creeds to the essence of what religion is about its about god in human beings in human consciousness
225665 a voice in my head said and you dont know anything about islam which was true i have five degrees four of them theological and other religions had never been taught seriously to me
225666 everything about my faith is rooted in the stories my two grandmothers told me
225667 no one formally taught me to pray as a child i had the question what is god like my grandmother answered that is like a drop in the ocean trying to understand what the ocean is like this is something i feel with my heart god is present in everything god is all around us
225668 there were a couple of imams muslim clerics and im thinking they know all this stuff and im stumbling around in it
225669 we had a pastor and an imam describe how they came to the faith that gives their lives meaning
225670 and we asked people to talk at their tables about how their faith came to them
225671 i dont think just knowledge about another faith is any good
225672 youve gotta meet someone who is of the faith who is speaking out of conviction and out of experience to really feel what islam is like
225673 puts muslims at ease because hes mastered the broad historical perspective of islam but also some of the nuanced details
225674 people are more open to learning a new perspective from someone they respect ben is not trying to convert anyone but to inform people and build understanding
225675 when i heard him talk about islam i thought we need him
225676 many christians are fearful of islam so they put up barriers they trust ben so they are willing to take the first step and listen for understanding
225677 if you sit in silence you can get deep enough into your faith that it touches another person
225678 the reality is that at the core were all the same
225679 in my 76th year i would be passionate about getting christians jews muslims and hindus together nothing in my history would point me in this direction this is not my dream i think its the spirit of god
225680 this beautiful sculpture is a fitting tribute to nassau countys own teddy roosevelt an independent minded republican great conservationist fearless police commissioner and battler for democracy

225683 we were devastated we had planned to build a house on it we played paintball on the property
225684 failure to pay your assessments will cause a tax certificate to be issued against the real property which may result in a loss of title
225685 how could this happen in america an incredible amount we would have to pay how could our government do this to us

225690 ive never heard of such a thing but it fits their plan to sell out to developers
225691 this is the first time the city of deltona has done it
225692 its a dri its a superpower center its for roads its dirt and trees out there now if the infrastructure goes in what does that do for the value
225693 the assessment is the cost of putting in the roads
225694 its unfortunate that the property has sat there for so long its property no one can access or enjoy
225695 ive had a couple of e mails saying please dont do it
225696 no single developer can afford to put over 30 million of roads in there
225697 ive heard of them assessing to put roads in but never to this caliber to some people this is their nest egg

225703 the mets had many needs and they filled not one of them a bat for the outfield corner needed that insurance for a rotation that includes the aging injury prone pedro martinez and john maine and his strained rotator cuff needed that another arm for the bullpen needed that too heck they could also stand an upgrade at second base yet they got nothing its no guarantee that ryan church will be productive once he returns from tandem concussions and fernando tatis is a prime candidate to regress in the coming weeks with so many outfield bats in play at the deadline its particularly disappointing that gm omar minaya failed to address that glaring need

225720 the verbiage that is used is not meant in any derogatory fashion it is only meant to more so speak to a certain group of youth

225724 i hate having to hide such a huge part of me from those i care about the most
225725 its gotten so bad that ive had three panic attacks about it this year
225726 they tease them beyond belief make them feel like they are nothing and god forbid a gay guy might smile at one of them they will talk about wanting to beat up that fag for the rest of the day i know they would never accept me
225727 alternative lifestyle not an alternative low acceptance of gay community
225728 i think smu as an institution is fairly supportive we have domestic partner benefits for staff and faculty financial support for student organizations and out faculty and a dean but as a culture i think there are great pockets of support in different areas and great pockets where there are not
225729 there is a hyper awareness of image and lifestyle here with a strong feeling of conformity everyone dresses the same they even cut their hair the same way and they just cant handle anything that goes against that mainstream
225730 they will flat out tell you that they are not interested in anything that has to do with supporting gay rights or alternative lifestyles at all
225731 they are apathetic if not hostile towards gay people several said they thought gay people had an agenda that is against the rest of society
225732 there are so many closeted people that it is unbelievable tons of top school leaders sports players and more
225733 if those people came out it would make a huge difference because right now most of the people on campus have never had a gay friend they only know what fox news tells them about gay people
225734 we really want to work on letting people know that there is a gay community at smu we do exist we are not a threat to their society in fact we often are key players in it
225735 we dont do this to pick on schools we create this list to raise awareness and help make things better
225736 one year after making the list students printed up all of these t shirts which said gay fine by me and started wearing them around campus
225737 shortly after that attitudes started to change and now they are not on the list
225738 for me its easier just to wait until i get out of here now i cant wait to leave all of this behind and never look back
225739 it was a very funny radio show like a funny banter going back and forth and thats what came out of my mouth obviously im joking still i dont believe in what the t shirt said i didnt say sorry i sent her some information and i sent her a letter from peta saying how the meat industry is horrible for the environment horrible for your health and sent her some information about it i dont know what her intentions were but she definitely wanted to be photographed in that t shirt and i thought you know put a smarter t shirt on

225749 there are so many consecutive over 100 degree days that it pays to be more proactive
225750 we really look out for each other but as police officers we tend to push ourselves to that limit
225751 pretty much each officer understands if they dont drink water they can die
225752 heres a tip for liberals if your candidate is going to stage enormous rallies in front of tens of thousands of chanting germans with monuments to prussian military might in the background in the middle of his presidential campaign it isnt the gops fault if the footage comes out looking a little like hitler at nuremberg
225753 i can actually see kind of a subtle godwin in the ad but you arent going to see me accusing mccains campaign of trying to paint obama as a nazi
225754 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
225755 of course this idiosyncratic personal conclusion of myself is self evident to any thinking human being
225756 obama rightly recognized that while the spot may have been a lot of things an insinuation about his foreignness a potential homage to leni riefenstahl a bald faced bid look starlets for free media attention it wasnt a subliminal message about miscegenation
225757 understandably hypersensitive to the varied uses of bigotry in politics given his latest historical subject

225759 the moodle community is growing with the needs of educators because it was developed to serve educators by educators

225771 he marvel has some admiration for the confederate government under jefferson davis quoting a british newspaper on a dinner in london attended by william gladstone then chancellor of the exchequer
225772 other historians suggest that popular sympathy for the emancipation proclamation in both britain and france made it politically impossible for their governments to offer recognition
225773 many civil war buffs will be delighted by marvels great detail on military action

225800 gotten caught in what could be the biggest auditing scandal in the history of this town and im not exaggerating here i will guarantee you as auditors around the country learn about this theyre going to have disbelief and raw anger that this agency has impugned the integrity of government auditors everywhere by these kinds of irresponsible actions
225801 dcaa audits allegations that certain audits at three locations did not meet professional standards were substantiated
225802 w e also found that contractor officials and the dod contracting community improperly influenced the audit scope conclusions and opinions of some audits a serious independence issue
225803 we noted a pattern of frequent management actions that served to intimidate the auditors and create an abusive environment as a result some auditors were hesitant to speak to us
225804 demonstrates that the governments system of contractor oversight is rotten because the independent government agencies that are supposed to look out for the taxpayers are corrupted
225805 we have senior members inside the dcaa who are retaliating against their own members in favor of the private contractors
225806 you know the department of defense has been on the high risk list of this government for more than a decade scandal after scandal has rolled out of the department of defense on contracting i took a trip to iraq just on contract oversight with an auditors eye meeting with the people that oversee the contracts in iraq i think we burned up more than 150 billion in just pure contracting abuse
225807 and all this time that we have been wasting hundreds and billions of dollars the fox was in the chicken coop
225808 we believe that public school funding is either too high or about right just like the 64 percent of oklahomans that responded to a recent friedman foundation survey
225809 oklahoma schools have enough money its just not being spent wisely
225810 and what do oklahoma students have to show for it
225811 sources close to the matter said the company has developed an in game advertising technology that allows it to insert video ads into games

225813 itd also go one step further and put a stop to all in flight voice communications
225814 i was just preparing a brief keep studying youre going to need it apparently
225815 but for you to compare the us to a regime that purposely attempted to exterminate a group of people based on their religion that is asinine and you should be ashamed
225816 im willing to give up some of my rights for security
225817 its unbelievable that a country the united states that many of us have looked to as the bastion of true freedom could now have eroded so many of the liberties we believed were upheld almost religiously
225818 you cant separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom
225819 it was impossible to gain enough support from the large institutions to win a majority of the yahoo directorships

225823 its been a long time i thought we were forgotten

225826 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
225827 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
225828 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent
225829 as far as live nation goes we believe we have substantially replaced the revenue that that business represents both with international expansion movement into the resale category and the recent acquisitions
225830 our focus now is driving comparable profitability through that business going forward both in the areas of ramping up to scale internationally and with resale and as weve previously announced we went through a very thorough global cost review in q2 and expect that were going to be pulling 35 million in cost out of the business on a full year basis in 2009
225831 so i feel like weve made very good progress on replacing that top line and are well on our way to driving that necessary profitability through
225832 a 7 percent increase in tickets sold with 10 percent higher average overall revenue per ticket
225833 the focus on margin is absolutely the right one as most of you know weve made a series of investments both in international expansion into new markets domestic acquisitions and investment into the resale category
225834 if you look at the margin compression in the business about 90 percent of it comes from this expansive activity by way of acquisition and movement into the resale category as a matter of fact if you look at pricing and volume in the core business its outpacing royalties and weve got good solid fundamentals and our focus is really on driving comparable profitability through these new areas of our business this will position us to grow very well over time
225835 one of the things thats really important in our business is scale so ticketmaster really is a business driven substantially by retail tickets sold through the platform so for example in 2007 we sold 141 million retail tickets
225836 when we acquire businesses they operate generally at levels of scale far below our own so weve got tremendous opportunity as we move them onto the platform consolidate operations to drive comparable profitability in these businesses that on a standalone basis would never enjoy the scale and therefore the margins that we enjoy so when you look across the platform were really focused now on operating what we have
225837 weve been watching closely but so far havent seen that the broader economic climate is directly impacting the live entertainment category or our business specifically
225838 you can be up and running in a couple of minutes
225839 they might pull their active patients and they might pull in ongoing diagnoses but what they usually do is after a visit or two they know what they need to know they archive and theyre done

225850 mandatory meetings at which the retailer stresses the downside for workers if stores were to be unionized
225851 wal mart may be walking a fine legal line by holding meetings with its store department heads that link politics with a strong antiunion message
225852 federal election rules permit companies to advocate for specific political candidates to its executives stockholders and salaried managers but not to hourly employees which most wal mart employees are store managers are salaried but department supervisors are hourly workers

225855 he needed to get rid of an ex girlfriend because she has him jammed up

225865 we have to re think our nuclear relationship with india like australia france and the u k are currently doing in light of the bold but faltering indo us civilian nuclear agreement
225866 ottawa now has a timely opportunity to reassess its non proliferation policies towards india that may revitalize nearly 40 years of lukewarm bilateral relations with new delhi in doing so canada can show india one of the rising giants of the 21st century that canada now means business against a host of suitors

225890 the ad gave us an uneasy feeling that the mccain campaign was starting up the same sort of racially tinged attack on mr obama that republican operatives ran against harold ford a black candidate for senate in tennessee in 2006 that assault too began with videos juxtaposing mr ford with young white women

225896 if obama is president will we still call it the white house
225897 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate

225984 doesnt matter if he did or didnt half inch a thing he still broke the law
225985 the only thing i could support is a fair trial if he didnt nick anything he should be sentenced for virtual breaking and entering we all do things outside of the rule book sometimes and we all know that we have to accept the consequences when we get caught book im
225986 the reality is that the man committed a crime and should be punished

226048 eu acho que n s n o podemos de nenhuma maneira neste momento em que eu leio nos jornais que h uma tend ncia e press es junto ao senhor presidente da rep blica para vetar esse projeto permitir que isso possa ocorrer sem d vida alguma seria um retrocesso no direito brasileiro
226049 vetar um projeto dessa magnitude com esse objetivo sem d vida alguma eu n o vejo que possa estar conjugado com a imagem do governo do presidente lula um governo que preserva as liberdades que se estabeleceu em nome das liberdades e da democracia
226050 fica um apelo para que o senhor presidente da rep blica n o venha a vetar esse projeto e encontre uma f rmula na qual viabilize a presen a do advogado na vida e no sistema do nosso direito sem que haja amea a sua liberdade de exercer a profiss o
226051 acho que esse um caminho que deve ser exercido tamb m com a colabora o da ordem cada vez sendo mais firme mais dura com aqueles advogados que saem do caminho que eles devem ter no exerc cio de sua profiss o dignificando a e n o a tornando muitas vezes motivo de execra o p blica

226059 you cant sneeze in this industry without angie pedersen knowing and blogging about it
226060 the breakdown of talks is worrying but not critical to the future of new build nuclear in the uk time is not on our side as the government has left it very late to give a firm direction for nuclear we need a clear resolution quickly as further delays might make it difficult to fill the looming energy gap
226061 it looks as though the population believes climate change is serious and there seems to be momentum behind the issue and there are some people who dont like that
226062 there are still plenty of creationists around and there are people who believe tobacco is not linked to serious health effects and so there are still people who choose to ignore or doubt the amount of evidence for climate change
226063 we would kill literally kill for a good paper that proved the science on global warming was wrong
226064 then i could retire and accept my chair at harvard unfortunately thats not going to happen and theres vast amounts of evidence why
226065 in essence the models we use to predict climate have been proven right
226066 you feed in the greenhouse gas concentrations that weve seen and the models predict extremely well the climate variations weve seen if you dont do that you get nothing the mathematical probability of it being a chance mistake or the wrong numbers is astronomical
226067 if theres been any change at all recently its that the observational evidence suggests were moving away from the lower limits of the abc projections towards more serious scenarios ive certainly seen no evidence of scientists holding back on their views or suppressing findings or anything approaching that
226068 i think there is healthy scepticism and then theres unhealthy scepticism
226069 what you do see is people who will claim that simply because they have a phd in engineering that they are an expert on climate modelling
226070 the other side of the coin is the danger that people who want to discuss the legitimate scientific issues in public becoming less if they are going to be called dangers we do need to keep giving scientists the freedom to go back and forth on these issues and apply their scepticism
226071 theres little doubt that if we burn all of the coal that sits below the earths surface we can return the planet to the condition it was in 50 million years ago when the antarctic was a tropical forest and much of the rest of the planet would be pretty difficult for human beings to live on
226072 weve got to see that coal is not a useful resource to burn unless we can recapture the carbon that is produced by burning it
226073 we therefore need to work positively towards carbon capture and storage if we can manage that then of course we can continue to use coal to drive our economies but frankly i havent seen the proof that that can be done
226074 this is still unproven technology and i think until its proven its dangerous to assume that we can continue to use coal
226075 i think those power stations are going to be priced out of the market as carbon dioxide pricing goes up so i quite simply dont think its a good private sector decision to invest in coal fired power stations
226076 it seems to me that carbon capture upon which the whole thing predicates you cant use coal unless you can capture the carbon is such an unproven science and its such a long time in the future that it would be dangerous in the extreme climatically for the government or e on to go ahead
226077 the rather boring fact is that the world is going to be burning lots of coal
226078 whatever people might wish whatever people singing in the sunshine at summer camps might idealise the world is going to be using lots of coals in future
226079 another coal power station at kingsnorth would be disastrous for the climate
226080 sir david king has joined the many others including both opposition parties who are speaking out against unabated coal power stations
226081 its now high time for the prime minister to step in show he has some courage and ditch the plans for kingsnorth
226082 a deep anxiety because people do want to know moral rules to live by
226083 the ability to act on the basis of own considered will
226084 few people who survived auschwitz continued to believe in the all powerful all good heavenly father or the scriptures
226085 therefore clive hamilton seems to pick up this challenge ignore the illusions of secular prosperity and lead us to something different who would not see some value in it
226086 i think the environmental urgency he responds to forces us to new thinking about the mysteries of existence
226087 its not very fashionable to espouse religious views so hes espousing a non spiritual spirituality which leaves everyone feeling somewhat confused he didnt know the solution it seems to be to charge up with some communal force but he doesnt say what it is or what it means
226088 its the idea of the classic philosophers life where you set yourself up as critical of modern life
226089 the big issue for me is this is all about morals and has political implications that are not spelled out
226090 i dont want someone deciding political implications on the basis of their own morals which would impinge on my freedom
226091 what i would endorse is that clive hamilton is resonating with a very ancient religious and philosophical tradition
226092 it would be a tremendous step forward to provide a more reliable robust system to serve the entire electric industry not just wind
226093 im not aware of any utility thats building a transmission line that doesnt on occasion need to make use of such a tool
226094 first step in providing the federal government siting authority that supplements existing state authority
226095 but it seems theres widespread and very diverse opposition to federally driven programs
226096 i hope that the suggestions made by our experts concerning sampling procedures bio monitoring and precautionary measures will help ensure that this dreadful tragedy does not also turn into an environmental disaster
226097 new nuclear build is supposed to be a central part of the governments energy strategy but it seems to be dependent on the decisions of foreign companies over whom it has absolutely no control
226098 disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful
226099 time is not on our side as the government has left it very late to give a firm direction for nuclear we need a clear resolution quickly as further delays might make it difficult to fill the looming energy gap
226100 it is pathetic that a government minister who not only controls 35 of british energy shares and who also has to commit public and consumers money to guarantee the future viability of the industry and who represents the public interest when it comes to licensing and planning should allow himself to be pushed about by british energy shareholders who simply want to cash in on their ownership of licensed nuclear sites
226101 hutton has got to get a grip and put the interest of the uk public who foot the bill before the self interest of the shareholders
226102 this takeover would have taken us back to the old days of a state subsidised monopolised nuclear power sector
226103 the french government via edf would have the monopoly while the british government via the taxpayer would have shelled out subsidies to the tune of billions
226104 i confirm our ambition to be a major actor of the nuclear rebirth in britain we have been working on that for three years and we have taken measures to reach this target
226105 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
226106 the first objective is in the context of the framework convention on climate change to determine the factors of emissions in order to carry out an inventory of greenhouse gases released by the sector
226107 the countries of the developing south according to the convention must adopt measures but are not obligated like the industrialised countries to reduce their emissions that is why we want to know for the countries like new zealand that do have an obligation how much they emit and how they are going to cut emissions
226108 china has been experiencing similar problems during its industrial revolution that western nations saw during their period of rapid growth pollution environmental damage and resource depletion
226109 domestically we are being constrained in many ways we do not have that many natural resources anymore
226110 we have to rely on the international markets so there is a big security concern there
226111 in order to really drive towards a low carbon economy policy incentives are crucial but it is not always the case
226112 the wind sectors fast growth was mainly a result of domestic policies because the government offered incentives to developments so that private and public sector entrepreneurs would jump on it
226113 but the solar pv sector benefitted mainly from the international market such as demand from the us and eu
226114 even today the policy incentives are still not there yet it still has grown to the level it is now
226115 in terms of total emissions china is already the worlds biggest emitter
226116 thats publicly available information even the government is not denying it anymore
226117 but if you look at emissions on a per capita basis we are not the biggest emitters because we have 1 3bn people
226118 but just looking at numbers does not help tackle global climate change
226119 in china we are concerned about the speed of growth in emissions it is really scary
226120 if they are not able to do it with the technology available to them then is it reasonable to expect china and india to do it
226121 china does not commit itself to a number and then not deliver
226122 when the technical economic and environmental viability of these small local plants is demonstrated they will mushroom throughout the amazon where oil bearing fruits are plentiful
226123 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
226124 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
226125 i may not have spoken out the way you want me to speak out
226126 the only way to solve the problems in this country is if we all come together black and white
226127 so if nascar wants to come back they better figure it out because i dont think the fans want to come back and see that

226147 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
226148 we have argued repeatedly that there is no need for federal legislation in this area and todays fcc action proves that point
226149 once a complaint was filed alleging that comcast had violated the fccs national internet policies it was appropriate for the fcc to adjudicate the complaint
226150 one need look no further than todays fcc decision for proof that engineering challenges on the internet should be solved by engineers not government officials
226151 in second guessing reasonable network management techniques with no notice or guidelines in place that benefit the overwhelming number of broadband subscribers in america the fcc has inexplicably elevated the interests of a few bandwidth hogs over everyone else
226152 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory
226153 defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
226154 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
226155 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated

226164 i got bored of synchronised swimming as it was not challenging im a person who likes speed and synchronised swimming did not give me the adrenaline rush
226165 swimming is more competitive and the training is much tougher my parents supported it and im glad i made the switch
226166 i love food and i dont control my diet i eat fried stuff and like to indulge myself in fast food all the time
226167 i train six times a week for five hours daily besides that i work out often and also do yoga im totally tired out when the day ends the only thing i do outside swimming nowadays is reading
226168 we believed in slavery for 18 and a half centuries before we came to know gods will for us with respect to people of colour
226169 it has been more painful than i thought it might be
226170 ive felt the exclusion profoundly i understand thats just the way it has to be but its a very odd and difficult feeling to have been separated from your own house of bishops by an external force
226171 as a constant and steady reminder that every bishop in the anglican communion has gay and lesbian people in their diocese whether they know it or not whether they know who they are or not whether it homosexuality is legal or not
226172 i dont consider them enemies at all and its no surprise to me that people who live in contexts very different from our own in the united states see this problem very differently
226173 its no surprise that many of these bishops and people in these countries where homosexuality is publishable sometimes by imprisonment have not had the experience we have had in the american church which is of faithful lesbian and gay people in the pews making themselves known to us and our having to grapple with that issue
226174 that doesnt mean i dont believe we shouldnt be changing those attitudes
226175 resist the push by those who are not here to try and settle this once and for all because in the end i think we will come to regret our rejection of gay and lesbian people the way we have come to regret our support for slavery and our virtual rejection of women
226176 the beauty of anglicanism is that it has been a big umbrella under which we can disagree about many things so long as we agree on the essentials
226177 i would plead for a continuation of that great tradition in which we hold together and we continue to be the church despite our differences on this issue because i dont think it rises to the level of being an essential
226178 you dont hear anyone on the side of those who would argue for greater inclusion of gay and lesbian people argue that anyone else has to leave no one is saying that the conservatives within the communion should leave because they dont understand the will of god
226179 that is what you hear coming from the other side and the difficulty of course is that you cant make anyone stay i would make a plea for our holding together while we live in this tension for a while
226180 we have no parishes threatening to break away i might even say its the one diocese in the whole of the anglican communion that doesnt deal with this issue at all
226181 though we do not share a faith we surely share a fate
226182 whatever our faith or lack of faith hunger still hurts disease still strikes poverty still disfigures and hate still kills
226183 if there is only competition and not co operation if there is only the state and the market and no covenantal relationships society will not survive
226184 what is the face religion all too often shows to the world conflict between faiths and sometimes within faiths
226185 your ability to hold together in a world driving us apart is your unique contribution
226186 the hardest thing in the world is to hold the adherents of a faith together the anglican communion has held together quite different strands of christian theology and practice more graciously and successfully than any other religion i know
226187 we may have forgotten this but for a thousand years between the first crusade and the holocaust the word christian struck fear into jewish hearts
226188 think only of the words the jewish encounter with christianity added to the vocabulary of human pain blood libel book burnings disputations forced conversions inquisition auto da fe public executions expulsion ghetto and pogrom
226189 and since then jews and christians have done more to mend their relationship than any other two religions on earth
226190 but now it is high on the agenda of virtually every bishop in the world
226191 we can play our part in being the glue that holds society together for the common good
226192 the dynamic of interfaith dialogue differs when muslims are in a minority and when they are in a majority
226193 dialogue is for us a daily business it is a dialogue of life
226194 dialogue has also helped us to help other people especially in transforming the society and we do it through education through health care and through programmes of poverty alleviation irrespective of creed caste or colour

226198 the passing of this resolution is particularly timely given the escalation of attacks against the bahais in iran in recent months
226199 this includes a arrests in march and may of the seven members of irans national bahai coordinating group they are being held in evin prison in tehran without any charges and without access to an attorney or to their families
226200 and we in the congress should not be silent as iran sets up the mechanism to ethnically cleanse its bahai minority totaling over 250 000 human beings
226201 it sends a strong signal that congress will continue to watch closely the treatment of the bahai people in iran
226202 we are deeply grateful that the u s house of representatives has passed this resolution which speaks up for those who are unable to have their voices heard in their homeland we look forward to the day when the iranian bahais will have their human rights restored and be able to contribute as equal citizens to the advancement of the country and the global community which they love

226217 i discussed the case as it was reported in the mainstream media but since then i have had the opportunity to discuss the case in detail with james todd an expert witness for the defense in the case and there are aspects of this case that are significantly different than reported
226218 from this reporting it seemed to me that fcworld member professor emeritus sandra mcclennan was the heroine of this story but the facts as revealed to me by james todd are quite different

226272 this doctor is using genuine homeopathy which replaces antibiotics of course
226273 it is already painfully obvious the angle the tv execs are going to take with this show welcome to the dark ages folks
226274 just because you want something to be true does not make it true
226275 we cant prove its true but you cant prove it isnt so there
226276 it is the vanity and arrogance of mere man that makes him deny that which is beyond his five senses
226277 the fact that so many people believe it proves theres something to it
226278 true and false are just meaningless concepts that spring from the human ego
226279 the proof is there it is just being suppressed by the powers that be for their own selfish reasons
226280 we have not proven difinitively why the sky is blue
226281 see i told you that you werent open minded enough
226282 oh but youre only seeing what you want to see
226283 in true science if something does not work you go back and reevaluate your assumptions methods ideas etc
226284 oh but youre only seeing what you want to see
226285 and for the record devonk richard saunders declared at the opening of the tv show that as a skeptic he was ready to believe so much for declaring psychic powers impossible
226286 thats been the problem with the psychic sceptic debate from the beginning neither side wants to see anything the other has to offer it is about winning and not about learning that simple idea is one of the many reasons i have massive respect for james randi in all his working with the challenge he has said he is willing to accept psychic ability is real provided that it can be proven through scientific methods that is an open honest and real way to look at the world and also the entire point to critical thinking in general too bad more of us dont follow that example
226287 the challanges have been laid out my friend and the most resounding one is
226288 due to the overwhelming evidence from the scientific comunity as well as general observable knowlege there is no reason to believe that the laws that have currently been agreed on by the majority of the scientific comunity can be circumvented
226289 putting your point concisely as opposed to attempting to make it sound as complicated as possible
226290 we can do a lot better if we just stop trying to be
226291 because i we said that everyone has psychic ability they do
226292 well maybe if you replied when people were overly nice which a lot of people have been doing with you you wouldnt get people being sarcastic because they know its the only way to get a response
226293 because shes afraid if someone walks in that something may happen to caylee
226294 and if she would just open up and tell us where caylee is this could end quickly
226295 im not afraid of anything because im going to do anything to protect my client
226296 thats my job thats my role in this process and no one seems to understand that theres no standing in the way theres no protecting theres no one in need of protection other than the things ive taken to do and thats exactly what im going to do
226297 it was the state led organization whose purpose was to put former or
226298 according to the recollection of survivors rok military police and police reserves called up the bodo league members were detained preemptively just after the outbreak of war even though they did not plot any protest against the south korean regime the executions of political prisoners and suspected communists may have been practiced without due process in every isolated valley of south korea initiatedfrom suwon and inchon on june 28 of 1950 three days after the norths invasion the killings were separately practiced until about the end of august 1950 now that several graves have been found the pattern of killing across the country resembles testimony offered by survivors the traitors were confined in jail for several days and finally were dragged to valleys to be shot
226299 i am immeasurably indebted to ham sok hon himself it will soon be eighteen years since i first met him and over nine years since he died but the longer i live the more i am conscious of how much i owe him specifically it was he who inspired me to become an historian rather than continue as an engineer to become a latitudinarian rather than a fundamentalist a humanist rather than an evangelical and a romantic rather than a puritan it was he who taught me to love and enjoy history and philosophy and all the most important things i needed to learn about life and humanity for me he has been a window through to the truth tao and god i wish he could have lived to see this result of his inspiration and teaching his memory and example have been with me ceaselessly as i live and work at it 1998 sung soo kim

226306 earnings for our upstream operations benefited from prices for crude oil that were significantly higher than a year ago
226307 natural gas prices also increased between periods contributing to a doubling of upstream profits from last years second quarter
226308 in our downstream business the increase in the price of crude oil had an opposite effect
226309 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states

226320 the government wants us to fail we are doing our best but we are under attack everywhere
226321 it is certainly going to close off all sorts of options for diplomacy and leave us very few options other than condemnation and isolation
226322 i think it is absolutely imperative to go straight to the top
226323 there is quite strong concern they will expel un staff and possibly entire agencies
226324 the organization id of the user being verified does not match the organization id of the execution context passed to verifyuser
226325 the government has not been seen to be transparent when it comes to the justice system as a whole it is unfortunate that this perception holds but the memories of what occurred in 1998 are too fresh
226326 it has to be credible and stand the utmost scrutiny there cannot be a shred of doubt in the evidence
226327 to not be credible would send a very bad signal not just internationally about our institutions for the man on the street it sets a bad precedent
226328 it has reminded the three parties that even after taking over five states in the last election the struggle is not over
226329 if we were so threatened by pakatan rakyat do you think we would have reformed the subsidy system and raised the price of petrol
226330 we would be more defensive and more populist instead the government is forging ahead and doing what it thinks is right
226331 the commissions findings were not in favour of the establishment the justice system now is in a state where you cannot have a cover up
226332 this is not 1998 at that time anwars case was the result of a power struggle in umno
226333 now this is something that is outside umno the people in charge now were not in positions of control then the circumstances are different

226376 do other people in your house tell you they knew you were on the way home based on how your dog was acting
226377 in fact in the uk there are few laws against quacks operating on humans but probe a dog without a veterinary license and the full wrath of british justice is brought against you
226378 of course its wrong to make fun of other peoples beliefs

226478 nb please do not read the lyrics whilst listening to the recordings
226479 in order to possess a song people do want to know what the lyrics are
226480 its emotional theres a reasoning you want to know why this line affects you so much
226481 might as well face it youre a dick in a glove
226482 when i was young and listening to elvis costello you had your own idea of what the lyrics were
226483 later when you then see the lyrics on the pages of boxed set sleevenotes you think thats not as good as i thought
226484 because then theyve made it their own theyve created the meaning and its all about meaning and identity
226485 a philosophy for life everyone in their lifetime is at one point the walrus the eggman and even the goo goo goo joob so i suppose the walrus is the leader the eggman is the follower and the goo goo goo joob is just undecided this song holds all the answers
226486 i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss well a few of the verses well theyve got me quite cross
226487 you see ive forgotten if theyre green or theyre blue anyway the thing is what i really mean yours are the sweetest eyes ive ever seen
226488 its interesting that people feel the need to have the text metered out on the page in front of them more often the more resonant meaning is in the sound the way its sung rather than on the page
226489 if you just look at the words written down youre missing a substantial part of the meaning and meaning is unfixed the way everybody hears a particular song is different and you bring your own resonance to the words
226490 it is often the songs that have less meaning that people tend to attach their meaning to like one what is it actually about
226491 both songs are very big echoey edifices of sound but very specifically human or humane in the point theyre making
226492 im not a u2 fan but one is a beautiful and affecting song in the line carry each other there is a sense of unity a very humane sentiment everybody hurts is the same its there in the title

226528 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
226529 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
226530 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent
226531 plaintiffs privacy claims fail among other reasons because the view of a home from the driveway that can be seen by any visitor delivery person or telephone repairman is not private
226532 todays satellite image technology means that complete privacy does not exist
226533 plaintiffs live in the 21st century united states where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass unless there is a clear expression such as a gate fence or keep out sign indicating that the public is not permitted to enter anyone may approach a home by a walkway driveway or any other route commonly used by visitors without liability for trespass
226534 we need to protect consumers access said fcc chairman kevin martin a republican
226535 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
226536 the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
226537 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
226538 we commend chairman martin and commissioners copps and adelstein for standing up for internet users and working across party lines to protect free speech and the free market

226542 the general feeling i get from looking at numerous university courses is that web languages like html css and javascript are below the technical threshold of most computer science programs and above the technical threshold of most mis new media programs what im getting at here is that many educational courses dont cover this kind of stuff in any great level of detail i would be willing to wager that if you ask 10 developers that work with web standards where they learned how to use web standards that 9 of them would reply that they are self taught the other 1 wont answer you because shes too busy trying to get her site to render properly in ie 6

226561 my family and i are so honored that the portion of the bill that will protect children from unsafe infant and toddler products such as cribs is named for our son danny
226562 this bill represents the most significant improvements to product safety since congress created the cpsc in the 1970s this reform is much needed long overdue and necessary to ensure that cpsc can successfully ensure the safety of consumer products
226563 we applaud the senate for their strong vote in support of consumer safety today
226564 this week congress responded to the wishes of parents and children all across america and passed legislation that will help restore our confidence in the safety of our toys and everyday products
226565 this landmark bi partisan legislation will overhaul an agency that as reported by consumer reports magazine was unable to do its job for far too long the president should now sign on the dotted line and turn this bill into law
226566 this bill introduces critical reforms like ensuring that toys are tested for safety before they go on the market banning certain hazardous substances and creating an online database for consumers to share information about dangerous products with each other
226567 consumers dont always come out on top in congress especially when big business fights hard but this time consumers won big congress deserves applause
226568 we applaud the senate for acting to get toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates out of our childrens toys
226569 this bill is a huge victory for americas littlest consumers in the face of exxonmobil and the chemical industrys efforts to gut it the conferees and their staff deserve tremendous credit for bringing it over the finish line
226570 congress passed today the strongest consumer product safety bill in 30 years
226571 our children and grandchildren are the big winners because their toys will be safer
226572 this bill will enhance the scientific integrity of the cpsc protect whistleblowers and improve consumer safety by making the agency more transparent and accountable

226578 the mandatory shall be responsible for seeing that no palestine territory shall be ceded or leased to or in any way placed under the control of the government of any foreign power
226579 nothing in this chapter shall be construed in or of itself to alter in any manner the terms of existing international instruments to which members of the united nations may respectively be parties
226580 does not affect any right obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination
226581 the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies
226582 this territory was not occupied in the sense of the geneva convention since those rules are designed to assure the reversion of the former legitimate sovereign which in this case does not exist
226583 had not been taken from a legitimate sovereign the fourth geneva convention and the hague regulations 1889 1907 were inapplicable there
226584 the convention applies only to acts by one signatory carried out on the territory of another the west bank is not the territory of a signatory power but an unallocated part of the british mandate the controversy about jewish settlements in the west bank is not therefore about legal rights but about the political will to override legal rights
226585 resulted in a lapse or vacancy of internationally recognized sovereignty the west bank was in legal jargon res nullius a thing belonging to no state
226586 sovereignty in international law may be acquired by any state in a position to assert effective and stable control without resort to unlawful means
226587 that israels presence in the territory constitutes an occupation is utterly specious
226588 the expulsion or murder of much of israels jewish inhabitants in 1967
226589 since the disputed territories were israels as a result of arab aggression they could not retroactively have become a cause
226590 that it is idiotic to base our claims on bergen belsen or abrahams interview with god

226745 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall
226746 it is the first time i know of that a pregnant womans body has been equated to a meth lab
226747 i hate to see a young mother put in prison away from her child
226748 but if she could be put in a treatment program with her children that would be the best course maybe we need to revisit the legislation
226749 this is an opportunity to get treatment and assistance to a mother whose addiction is so bad she has chosen to take illegal drugs while carrying a child
226750 i made the biggest mistake of my life and did some drugs with her father right before i went into labor unaware i was about to have her
226751 i get out and i have a child whos 1 its hard to adjust to being the mother
226752 i decided to get this over so she wouldnt remember
226753 if we prosecute pregnant women who use any kind of illicit substance we are opening the door to other prosecutions

226758 he couldnt afford that were playing and winning and every game is a big game he was able to step in and play at a high level from day one
226759 youre so used to being a dominant player in high school and college and not really having any problems on the field
226760 i think hes playing a lot more relaxed and a lot more focusing on the next play
226761 now he can take one part of a particular technique and improve it then he can see the real good results of improving just one part of it
226762 would get hung up on improving one part of it then something else went to pot today we did that and said ok youve got that now now lets focus on the next part last year he couldnt do that he would get hung up and dwell on only one part of it
226763 coming in last year i was trying to get the system down now i have the system down and im working on technique
226764 it depends on the person but for me it was tough
226765 it took me almost the whole year to get it down im a tough critic of myself i expect to get everything right if i didnt get something right id beat myself up on it
226766 i dont harp on the past like i did last year that was one thing i really needed to work on i would get down if i did something bad and start spiraling downward i had to get over that and let the last play be the last play and sort of move on and forget about it
226767 im doing a much better job of that this year

226785 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who who could have been a good australian citizen
226786 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we would have been a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case

226948 i remember everything i remember it being sunny and hot i had my window down
226949 the next thing i knew the concrete started to wave in front of me
226950 the bridge pulled apart in front of me and i went sliding
226951 i said i will not die on that bridge i am not going to die today
226952 this is not the way i am going to go
226953 when i hear that many states have close to a majority of their bridges deemed obsolete or structurally deficient that scares me and i think that finding ways to help remedy those problems that simultaneously relieve states of the burden financially is very very important and should be a welcome trend in the united states
226954 without a doubt our federal approach to transportation is broken
226955 it is time for a new a different and a better approach
226956 we are looking at mileage based revenue structures where people could be taxed based on the miles they travel we are looking at private sector investments
226957 you would have thought the state learned its lesson and done a better job of inspecting the bridges and overpasses yet this was one they failed to accurately assess it was like a meteor falling to the ground
226958 i say how did we get money for stadiums how did we get money for all these new stadiums were building
226959 whats more important baseball or safe traveling should we all be afraid every time we cross a bridge now

226964 currently available electrolyzers which split water with electricity and are often used industrially are not suited for artificial photosynthesis because they are very expensive and require a highly basic non benign environment that has little to do with the conditions under which photosynthesis operates
226965 they took too much time to handle calls and didnt take as much calls a day as other workers

227059 so wichtig ist wolfgang clement nicht mehr dass wir nun wochenlang dar ber streiten sollten wie das mit ihm weitergeht
227060 es hat doch ohnehin seit monaten niemand mehr geglaubt dass wolfgang clement spd mitglied ist da w rde es auch keinen berraschen wenn er es nicht mehr ist
227061 allerdings wird die kommission auch die politische biografie eines sozialdemokraten zu w rdigen haben der spd landesvorsitzender war der ministerpr sident war und der nicht gez gert hat dem ruf nach berlin als bundesminister zu folgen
227062 die engere parteif hrung kann und wird dem urteil der bundesschiedskommission nicht vorgreifen mir ist aber wichtig dass in einer gesamtbetrachtung sowohl pers nliches verhalten als auch die politische lebensleistung in die beurteilung einbezogen werden
227063 wolfgang clement hat durch sein politisches lebenswerk erhebliche und beachtenswerte leistungen und beitr ge erbracht und sich damit um die spd verdient gemacht

227073 it is a shame that the conservatives appear to have once again fundamentally misunderstood our published figures
227074 in the last five years ace has reduced its administration costs by 10 3 million down from 10 to 8 of our overall income from government and lottery not only is this lower than the 9 target proposed by the conservatives in their recent good causes report but we have publicly stated our intention to reduce administrative costs by a further 6 5 million by 2011
227075 many of the arts organisations that lost out on grants during the recent spending round will be disappointed to learn that the arts council spent 30 million on its own operating costs almost 2 million on governance costs and a further 27 million on other activities a total of almost 60 million
227076 the level of spending is even more worrying when one considers that if you remove grants for the five largest organisations the national theatre the royal opera house english national opera the royal shakespeare company and the southbank centre which total almost 100 million this 60 million in costs represents more than a fifth of the grants the arts council administered the next conservative government will ensure that as much money as possible goes to front line arts organisations rather than central administration
227077 no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one state over those of another nor shall vessels bound to or from one state be obliged to enter clear or pay duties in another
227078 a very material object of this power was the relief of the states which import and export through other states from the improper contributions levied on them by the latter were these at liberty to regulate the trade between state and state it must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the articles of import and export during the passage through their jurisdiction with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter and the consumers of the former we may be assured by past experience that such a practice would be introduced by future contrivances and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs that it would nourish unceasing animosities and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquility

227160 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
227161 that was my specific reference and if karadzic is in the hague and is still scared that i have an arm that long i guess i should treat it in a backhanded way as a compliment
227162 i will work from the assumption that there might be a retrial and i will assume that it is likely to be in the new year
227163 you cant kill innocent people you cant commit suicide that is a bedrock of islam
227164 this latest trial has shown yet again that much more was known about the 7 7 bombers by the police and security services than the victims and public were told
227165 the victims the bereaved and the public are entitled to know the full facts behind the worst terrorist atrocity on the uk mainland they are entitled to know whether or not the 7 july 2005 bombings could have been prevented and they are entitled to know whether lessons have been learned
227166 and helping companies extend their existing infrastructure and overcome the operational hurdles theyre facing around scale availability and energy efficiency
227167 clearly weve moved to a point in time where our customers have to be much more focused on protecting the information itself as opposed to protecting the pc or protecting the network
227168 while those are necessary components of a protection strategy theyre not the end all more has to be done
227169 good data loss policies start with the understanding of what is the critical data that i have and where is it
227170 in many instances there is some critical and sensitive information on every laptop but not all information thats on that laptop is critical and sensitive
227171 if you think cryptography is the solution to this problem you dont understand the problem and you dont understand cryptography
227172 youve got to look at what value you place on the information
227173 nobody wants to pay 500 to protect a 50 asset
227174 theyve had to learn the hard way you cant solve technology problems with policies and you cant solve policy problems with technology
227175 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
227176 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
227177 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
227178 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
227179 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall
227180 naomi went from one doctor to another in america pulled all her contacts and did not take no for an answer my daughter saved my life

227183 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
227184 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
227185 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
227186 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
227187 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
227188 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
227189 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
227190 obama is new to the scene people have questions and hang back
227191 you will have a story told about obama every day
227192 its giving us a better understanding of how he would be as president
227193 it takes them years to feel they know a politician
227194 what the candidates do in september and october is going to matter more
227195 its going to be mid september before we get a truly accurate reading of whats going on

227197 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
227198 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
227199 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
227200 knowing is not enough we must apply willing is not enough we must do
227201 the charges demonstrate the commitment of everyone who worked on the case to find the alleged offender and now we will help the states attorney make sure justice is served
227202 the use of electronic media is arguably superior to providing company information the old way
227203 it can be presented in interactive formats to allow each individual to click through to the level that is appropriate to him
227204 that is a welcome clarification and could encourage companies to be more innovative and creative in how they present their disclosures online rather than merely dumping documents in pdf or image based documents that mirror the printed documents
227205 it could also encourage companies to make investments to improve their investor relations web sites and facilitate the use of blogs for communication and investors
227206 importantly while the new guidance says that companies and their employees are liable for information they post on blogs and discussion forums not really news they have no duty to correct inaccurate information posted in comments on their sites by third parties
227207 could break the age old shackles that bound businesses to traditional media and distribution channels
227208 if the hypervisor is already commoditized and most of your competitors have a free version then paul maritz did the right thing
227209 you saw how fast he moved diane greene wasnt out of there two weeks
227210 were focusing our efforts on the 20 plus products we sell on top of the hypervisor this is a continuation for us of a long term strategy
227211 in terms of the pure hypervisor clearly esxi is more appealing
227212 discriminatory and not narrowly tailored to address comcasts concern about network congestion
227213 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
227214 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
227215 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
227216 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
227217 the fact is the fcc does not know what comcast did and did not do
227218 ironically todays decision may result in slow speeds for 95 percent of internet users

227237 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
227238 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
227239 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
227240 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
227241 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship

227265 were not supposed to talk about ourselves our job is to share this message
227266 oh well you see i dont have any friends who are jws when did you become a jw or were your born into the church
227267 i was born into the church my mother used to be catholic then she became baptist then she became jehovahs witness
227268 i follow jesus or i try to ive been doing it a long time now but i still find that each step is fresh and takes me forward to a place where its new all over again its exciting
227269 when i was a kid i didnt care about the important things i mean obviously god is not here right all i did was go to the mall and hang out with my friends but now i care about the bible
227270 wait a minute what do you mean when you say god is not here
227271 i mean you cant see him so he didnt seem real to me
227272 oh ok fair enough now i assume you still go to the mall
227273 really when i go to the mall i see god there
227274 yes but not just that when you go to the mall god is there hes doing stuff
227275 sort of but one of the things jesus said was i do nothing except what i see the father doing so were supposed to do the same thing i look out and i try to see what the father is doing like here in our cul de sac god is up to something and i want to be part of it
227276 yes thats why were doing this but dont you agree that if everyone believed the world would be a better place
227277 of course things are broken but everything will be made new

227287 it is an introduction film which shows the preparations for the olympics and the iocs own work together with local organisers
227288 it is such an obvious propaganda film pure marketing for china and the olympic games we are not used to seeing this type of thing from public service nor on any other channel for that matter this had nothing to do with journalism
227289 we considered it appropriate in relation to everything else we broadcast you cant take each program on its own you have to look at the whole picture
227290 it is a question of the companys editorial integrity if the film is included in an agreement and has been produced by a public relations firm then it is definitely inappropriate
227291 we had a passionate affair that lasted 4 5 days we were good together

227295 because of the amount of stuff thats coming into live its actually a little difficult for people to find it especially people outside the core users
227296 its based on this idea that you know exactly what you want to do hit the eject button put the disc in go to multiplayer and start playing your halo match thats the way its always worked that worked super well for the cognoscenti of the console world but the truth is that theres an amazing amount of content that for a lot of people is hard to find
227297 the idea is to move toward this channel metaphor so you can see at a glance the types of things that i can do on my box to make these things much more relevant about me
227298 today if youre playing halo and i say hey lets play uno its a case of right ill set up the session and ill invite you in theres a whole bunch of steps and im wondering whats going to happen where hes gone for new people thats difficult so what if the party leader selects the new experience and we all go there together no loss of communication no loss of us being together and social
227299 the community channel will be filled with animated avatars that are all saying come on over im playing this press one button and you can party up and get into their experience or start that conversation

227331 hybrids are top of mind for buyers seeking low emissions high fuel efficiency vehicles but not all hybrids are created equal
227332 when developing the altima hybrid nissan engineers had a requirement to make it a nissan style hybrid not just a fuel efficient car this is a key reason that the altima hybrid has done so well when stacked up against the competition such as in the recent comparison by a leading automotive enthusiast magazine which called the altima hybrid the best among the hybrids tested
227333 altima hybrids drive system creates a synergy between its electric motor and its gasoline engine offering efficiency and excitement in the same attractive package
227334 altima hybrid feels remarkably smooth most drivers will never be aware of the transitions between the electric and gasoline power sources
227335 mostly what they will feel is highly responsive acceleration and the seamless delivery of power under almost all driving conditions
227336 already considered a benchmark in the performance luxury suv category the mdx improves for 2009
227337 we expect the 2009 mdx to continue as one of acuras best selling models
227338 we have worked with mattel for more than 10 years and the development of a matchbox version of the evora 1 64 model unfolded at the same time as our first evora was being built so there was a lot of excitement and synergy around the two projects the dramatic plan shape and the distinctive graphical detailing of the real car are perfect for a scale model all the design team grew up with matchbox so it was tremendously exciting to work with the company that is in part responsible for inspiring our interest in car design
227339 we have a close long standing relationship with lotus and partnering with them to create a matchbox version of the new evora in advance of its introduction was a unique and exciting opportunity for our designers
227340 the matchbox team was among a handful of people who were privy to the new cars final design our team approached this project with our passion for all things automotive along with a deep understanding of the ethos behind the lotus design
227341 go out there give myself a chance make some putts and above all keep my compo
227342 altima coupe is sleek and sporty featuring an aggressive stance and a bold shoulder that adds dimension to the body side
227343 its a car that looks much more expensive than it is both the exterior and interior and feels like it too
227344 the driving performance of the altima coupe is biased toward sporty feel especially when equipped with our award winning v6
227345 handling is also a strong point of the coupe as is the responsiveness feeling provided by the xtronic cvt transmission
227346 along with the altima coupes extensive list of available features and amenities it offers one more thing to discerning coupe buyers the reassurance of nissan durability quality and reliability
227347 given the uncertainties in the u s and limited visibility into traction in its growth initiatives and trading at 11x enterprise value 08 ebitda we believe growth and valuation will be handicapped

227366 get your ass down to first base and shut up
227367 it was a great practice we had good tempo and had great spirits we got a lot done
227368 its good we have some good competition there every day you come out here you see one guy that flashes we have a number of preseason games to put our defense in but im looking forward to seeing them in live conditions weve got some great effort weve some young guys with a lot of potential well just wait and see
227369 its very similar to what ive done with tom nalen what ive done with dewayne robertson here is a veteran guy that came off surgery and missed six practices in a row and didnt complain and didnt want to miss practice but i thought it was the best for him
227370 hes going to have an mri today to just check everything out and make sure if there is something we have missed according to head athletic trainer steve antonopulos its not the knee its beneath the knee the bursa sac is causing him a little irritation right now he doesnt think its anything serious but to prevent anything we are going to check it with an mri and hope itll be fine and just a little bit sore
227371 he is having a good camp he has his weight back anytime you are in your third year you feel a lot more comfortable the terminology the system the supporting cast and the defenses most quarterbacks in their third year want to go out and prove themselves
227372 it really doesnt i wasnt promised anything all i was promised was the opportunity to compete and im still competing i have nothing but respect and admiration for john lynch i was sorry to see him leave i was learning a lot for him and he was a great veteran leader and i am going to miss him around here
227373 i was surprised he didnt say anything to anybody obviously he and coach mike shanahan spoke it was new to us all yesterday i wish him the best and i hope that he lands somewhere else i wish him nothing but success
227374 not yet when i came on my visit we spoke about some things coach shanahan is a guru he knows everything if he needs me i am available he knows that i am sure as the games get closer and week 2 starts to arrive im sure i will have a sit down with the offensive coordinator
227375 i have always tried to carry myself as a leader and was in san diego in this secondary with champ bailey dre bly and hamza abdullah im able to focus on doing what i need to do to help this team win games and win the division and ultimately get a chance to win the super bowl i am more than willing and capable of being a leader and that is what i plan on doing
227376 hes got a pretty strong arm every time we got ready to play him our coach said stay deep this kid can throw a hundred thousand yards hes got a strong arm hes got a cannon im impressed by him i am impressed with brandon marshall brandon stokley and eddie royal those guys dont drop anything the hard catches they make them cutler is doing really well i am impressed by him too
227377 im a little shocked me playing with john for last four years and how competitive he is and how much pride he has about what he is doing on the field it stinks that he cant play every down but that is what he wants to do he wasnt happy with his role and i am behind his decision all the way whatever he wants to do i would love him to stay but every guy has to look out for himself
227378 not to this extreme i didnt see it coming i knew that he was uncomfortable with his role and that is pretty much all i knew
227379 he was almost like a fourth linebacker out there hes great in run defense and his leadership most of all is going to be missed because he is a proven winner and a hall of fame player and guys look up to him and respect him for what he has done and what he can do
227380 well you dont have to yell at anybody to be a leader i think people misunderstand you can just lead by example i think the way you lead on this defense is by just working hard everyday and when guys get down you pick them up i know myself that i have to step up a little bit without john here because john was always the guy who would say something there are a lot of guys that lead by example look at d j williams we expect everybody to pick themselves up and gather around him
227381 he was very frustrated this would have been his 16th year i cant say that i have been there but he just came off of a pro bowl year it is not like he cant play when a team is ready to move on and go in a certain direction that is the way you have to take it jerry rice didnt finish in san francisco but he was a great player
227382 well not really i think the hardest thing is that we will just miss his presence and what he brought to us i think we have a lot of time to adjust so i dont think it will set us back too much
227383 they are smart players and they have been around so we expect them to fill in and play as well as we expect them to
227384 im getting used to it looking back at 05 we probably have 10 12 guys on the whole team its nothing new it is just the way this business is
227385 we need to step up losing a player is all part of the game you have people and you lose them its the responsibility of everyone else to step up and fill that role whether it is on field stuff or leadership i think we have enough guys to do that
227386 it caught me off guard a little bit its hard to say im surprised what is it like 15 years its not just a flat out surprise but the fact that he has been here five days and just disappeared caught us all off guard
227387 i didnt sense it he did a good job covering it up its hard to imagine he wasnt a little frustrated being the perennial pro bowler that he is to come in and not be an every down guy im sure hes frustrated
227388 i dont think its one person i think we have a lot of great leadership one of the best things about this team so far is that people have been self motivated and leading themselves it makes for a better team we havent had any situations where we needed a guy to step up by yelling and screaming to get us in line everyone is here everyday and ready to work

227469 i hate to see a young mother put in prison away from her child
227470 but if she could be put in a treatment program with her children that would be the best course maybe we need to revisit the legislation
227471 this is an opportunity to get treatment and assistance to a mother whose addiction is so bad she has chosen to take illegal drugs while carrying a child
227472 i made the biggest mistake of my life and did some drugs with her father right before i went into labor unaware i was about to have her
227473 i get out and i have a child whos 1 its hard to adjust to being the mother
227474 i decided to get this over so she wouldnt remember
227475 if we prosecute pregnant women who use any kind of illicit substance we are opening the door to other prosecutions

227491 las zonas monta osas del sur del territorio constituyen los puntos m s susceptibles de deslaves durante la presente temporada de lluvias por lo que se coordinan acciones con gobiernos municipales y protecci n civil para atender cualquier situaci n adversa
227492 tambi n contamos con un fondo de contingencias que el gobierno del estado a trav s de protecci n civil tiene considerado para ese tipo de situaciones porque son fen menos que no se pueden prevenir
227493 aunque es dif cil enfrentar los riesgos de las contingencias ambientales

227495 our approach is proactive both in promoting and protecting the interests of the city
227496 our impact measure more accurately gauges what is going on in the classroom which is the way schools really should be evaluated if were trying to determine their effectiveness
227497 we cant evaluate schools assuming that they all serve similar kinds of children
227498 if we evaluate schools that way things change quite a bit as far as which ones we would identify as failing
227499 it suggests that many schools serving disadvantaged kids are doing a good job with children who face a lot of challenges
227500 these schools may be serving children from advantaged backgrounds who do well on achievement tests but the learning rate for their students isnt dramatically faster when they are in school versus when they are not in other words these schools are not having much positive impact
227501 we are not pressuring the schools that need to be pressured
227502 when you shift the focus from achievement to impact there are still schools that do very well and some that do poorly
227503 but they are not necessarily where you think they are there are high impact schools in every kind of neighborhood serving every kind of child the same is true of low impact schools
227504 if theres a school that rates high in educational impact but low on achievement maybe the school should have a summer program with those same teachers who are having such a positive impact
227505 thats certainly more appropriate than saying something must be wrong with this school because of the low achievement scores
227506 rather than use those six tests for low quality information lets redistribute them differently to get quality information about the schools

227512 heikki ist ein teamplayer und hat in deutschland seinem deutlich schnelleren kollegen platz gemacht
227513 er hat mit seinen erfolgen bei den extrem schwierigen grands prix von england und deutschland bewiesen dass er seine balance als weltklassefahrer gefunden hat
227514 er hat aus seinen fehlern zum ende der letzten saison und zu beginn der diesj hrigen saison gelernt und zum richtigen zeitpunkt die botschaft verstanden wie er sich auch in schwierigen rennen als potentieller weltmeister verhalten muss aus meiner sicht befindet er sich auf dem richtigen weg wenn er und das team jetzt in dieser richtung weiter arbeiten kann ferrari diese kombination nicht schlagen

227517 the key drivers of the monthly change are a 3 5 m m rise in energy prices are linked to a 6 5 increase in petrol price and a 0 3 rise in services prices notably a 6 m m rise in airfares stronger than the seasonal average of recent years reflecting the fact that some large uk carriers raised air passenger duty rates in the month
227518 the consumer prices figures have provided some nasty surprises in the last few months although inflation was expected to move above 3 in may triggering only the second ever open letter from the governor of the bank of england to the chancellor the outturn of 3 3 was higher than expected the picture is unlikely to improve in junes figures if nothing else petrol prices are likely to have registered another chunky increase in response to the latest surge in oil prices to close to 140 per barrel
227519 the business sentiment index which has generally held just below 40 since january 2008 weakened to a new threshold of 52 4 in june the lowest level since year end 1992 given the size of junes decline the july survey is expected to confirm the past deterioration without necessarily building on it the business sentiment index could level off temporarily or decline slightly the current conditions index in contrast could drop off much more sharply after declining slightly in june even though it still held above the historical average
227520 the sixth consecutive fall in incoming orders will add to the downturn in business expectations if our forecast is correct this would be the lowest reading since late 1992 a time when germany was in recession
227521 using a fuse that must be replaced each time an overcurrent condition occurs is unacceptable

227534 o my people think over it if i act upon a clear direction from my lord who has bestowed on me from himself the merciful talent of seeing the right way a way which you cannot see for yourself does it follow that we can force you to take the right path when you definitely decline to take it 17 53 54 and tell my servants that they should speak in a most kindly manner verily satan is always ready to stir up discord between men for verily satan is mans foe hence we have not sent you with power to determine their faith 21 107 109 o prophet we have not sent you except to be a mercy to all mankind

227540 the knowledge of it is verily with god alone and verily i am but a plain warner
227541 to us our deeds and to you yours peace be to you we seek not the ignorant
227542 so have we appointed for every prophet an enemy devils of men and jinns who inspire each other with seductive deceptive speech which leads astray but had thy lord willed they would not have done so so leave them with what they do devise and let the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter listen to it and let them be well pleased with it and let them gain what they can gain
227543 and when you see those who meddle with our revelations
227544 because of that we presribed to the children of isael that whoever kills a soul unless it be for retaliation or because of spreading corruption earth it would be as if he had killed all mankind and whoever saves a life it would be as if he had saved the life of all mankind and certainly our messsengers came to them with clear signs but even after that many of the the children of israel transgressed on earth

227601 es ist nicht sinnvoll dass jetzt schon au enstehende eigene veranstaltungen dazu machen
227602 erst mal sprachlos aber genug verunsichert um das zu canceln
227603 man kann gar nicht genug gegen rechtsextremismus machen es ist albern dass die stadt das zentral an sich ziehen will
227604 anstatt den veranstalter zu ermutigen werden dem kn ppel zwischen die beine geworfen

227607 all it took to set off a full 24 hours of cable news hysteria was one quote that the washington posts dana milbank attributed to barack obama second hand unsourced out of context and eventually widely disputed nice work everybody
227608 if you ask i have one or not yes i do have a prick but my wife wont let me use on you sorry
227609 maybe whoever did this should be taken to a cornfield on a 100 deg day to get the same treatment
227610 may i be the first to ask a resounding why
227611 as usual here in hungary it was a difficult friday because of the dusty circuit it was hard to draw clear conclusions because there was tyre graining that affected the cars performance and general balance so we concentrated on finding out what kind of behaviour we can expect from the tyres i hope we can have another strong weekend because i like this track the car has been competitive recently and we are looking to score more points
227612 the morning went well for me on the dirty track surface and we had no problems with the car in the second session the track changed there was a bit more grip and the car started to be a bit trickier to drive but overall this was not a bad first day hopefully we can continue with this speed if i can qualify well and we can have the race pace we had in hockenheim then a points finish should be possible after my accident in the last race ive completely recovered i tested at last week without problems i passed a further medical check yesterday and i felt fine driving the car today

227615 those who said senator mccain was throwing away floridas electoral votes by advocating more offshore drilling might want to think again
227616 whether thats because they dont know the specifics of each mans plan or just dont think drilling is important enough to swing their votes is the great unknown
227617 we have to pay much more attention to the foreign market than we used to
227618 no matter what good you do managers can always find fault in you
227619 sure lets do a poll but an open one where everyone can vote with their own
227620 unfortunately the result of the austrian reference is still some way off it is too far away for it to be right for us simply to await that result we think it right to make a ruling now but one that allows for the possibility which we think unlikely that the reference would make a difference to the result
227621 what were doing allows you to use solar panels 24 7 because you can use the fuel that they generate any time you want
227622 i assure you once these liquor and parking licenses are up in december they will not be issued if theyre still delinquent
227623 id be very surprised if an entity like that would let the city take over a venue valued at 15 million to 20 million for taxes owed that are under 1 million
227624 under our ordinances the stipulation is that you cant get licenses if youre in arrears in your taxes
227625 i wasnt trying to indicate that it was the mayors fault but theres an appearance of impropriety here how can one business be allowed to operate when others have been shut down almost immediately
227626 if theyre in arrears now once we notify them then well be in revocation proceedings regarding the licenses weve issued them
227627 im not aware of the two years in arrears i dont recall that that happened did they get preferential treatment thats not the case with the license commission theyre treated like any other licensee
227628 its been awhile since we released our last new title but for a very good reason our latest title jaybots catchy cadence is an amazing game and its now ready to play

227644 it just might really piss them off even more than they already are
227645 and people say illegals arent using the system arent costing us anything
227646 i hope they also levied a fine for employing an undocumented worker to take advantage of the fact that the employee was illegal in hiring them and then attempting to get out of paying fair compensation for on the job injuries simply because an individual is
227647 thats what they get for hiring an illegal in the first place
227648 we are calling for revolutionary change in our nations animal shelter practices and policies
227649 most people believe shelters exist to protect animals tragically the reverse is often the case the institutional killing of cats in animal pounds and shelters is the leading documented cause of death for cats in the united states
227650 that is why we are mobilizing the public and working to fix our broken sheltering system
227651 there was some early uproar when facebook first permitted applications about some of the music sharing apps
227652 what ultimately happened then was that the music sharing apps very rapidly were tweaked so that people werent doing any actual file sharing
227653 hasbro certainly couldve saber rattled and pushed the issue with facebook
227654 particularly under the grokster decision from a few years back facebook has to be very careful even if its getting indemnity from the people who are putting applications on the site that indemnity might not amount to much if theres very little there to back it up
227655 in fact in last weeks f8 conference announcement they said they are trying to award and sort out the good applications versus the not so good ones
227656 its posturing but its the way that they are ensuring that theyre not in bed with their application makers for this purpose
227657 strive s to work with developers to correct any issues we discover but when necessary we will act quickly to correct problems and ensure a safe and high quality facebook platform experience for all
227658 i think that this is a questionable area of intellectual property law and its not clear cut
227659 when things arent clear cut you dont necessarily go and cut off peoples access to platforms
227660 the thing is theres 400 000 developers using facebooks platform and theyre trying to find ways to be successful and that means copying games that are going to work
227661 theyre clearly trying to segment quality apps that help the user experience versus ones that dont
227662 theyre a private entity theyre not a public utility and theyre not an isp
227663 its perhaps disingenuous for facebook to use the word neutral in that kind of situation because at the end of the day they do hold all the cards on what people can and cannot do on their site
227664 if you dont make the problems public the companies dont fix them and the consumers buy shoddy stuff
227665 the concept of responsible disclosure is well and good for new locks that havent hit the market yet but that doesnt help you when the lock is already embedded in millions of facilities theyre not going to fix them
227666 how does it help the consumer not to tell them that there is a vulnerability
227667 medeco customers have a right to know whether their locks can be compromised
227668 we believe that lock picking obviously is an illicit activity even if its a sport we frown on all of that even if its for fun
227669 as new technologies have become available that is what spurred product innovation and that spurs development of new standards
227670 our responsibility is to make changes when we see a change in the state of the art
227671 everybody has some responsibility to not disclose things that can hurt people and that people dont have power over changing
227672 is it a known vulnerability if people dont know about it
227673 im not sure you need to worry about it unless people are out there demonstrating it and showing how to do it
227674 the assumption is that the criminals dont know about it
227675 criminals know how to pick locks the secrecy just hides the truth from the consumer
227676 the goal is to make security better as soon as its not responsible to do research the bad guys win
227677 the lock picking industry doesnt get this because theyre basically still a guild a secret knowledge kind of field whereas computer security is always built on open knowledge
227678 there have been insecurities discovered by computer people turned locksmiths that have existed for hundreds of years
227679 let them make their security assessments based on how secure they are told the locks are

227684 vdi staat nog in de kinderschoenen en is zeker nog in ontwikkeling sinds kort zijn twee grote namen in de virtualisatiewereld vmware en citrix ingestapt in vdi met deze toetreding zal er in ieder geval een versnelling komen in de r evolutie van het product vdi de virtualisatie van het werkstation zou nog een stap verder kunnen door het te verplaatsen naar de hardware van het werkstation zelf hiermee bedoel ik de virtualisatie van de lokale hardware met een synchronisatie naar het datacenter indien de mogelijkheid zich voordoet hiermee komt er ook een mogelijkheid voor laptops om gebruik te maken van de voordelen van vdi er is nog een lange weg te gaan maar ik ben ervan overtuigd dat met vdi een eerste stap is gezet naar een flexibele en dynamische werkstationinfrastructuur
227685 virtualisatie op de desktop is een volgende stap in de virtualisatiemarkt de vraag is of iedereen hier al aan toe is op dit moment is iedereen zich aan het richten op de virtualisatie van de servers enerzijds omdat de servers steeds krachtiger worden anderzijds vanwege milieuredenen zal de vdi techniek echt doordringen tot de desktop voorwaarde is denk ik dat de applicatie geschikt is om hiermee om te gaan de huidige technieken citrix en rdp hebben voor een aantal applicaties beperkingen waardoor ze eigenlijk niet gebruikt worden indien deze beperkingen uit de weg worden genomen is er zeker een kans van slagen verschillende bedrijven zijn inmiddels betrokken bij de ontwikkeling van vdi vooral voor het versnellen en beperken van het verkeer
227686 ik denk dat er twee verschillende technologie n op een hoop worden gegooid aan de ene kant de nieuwe incarnatie van de domme terminal aan de andere kant het gebruik van virtualisatie voor de dekstop het ene is prima zonder het andere te gebruiken een terminal in combinatie met een broker en windows server levert minder problemen op dan de hier beschreven oplossing wat ook niet vergeten moet worden is dat met vdi de desktop effects en film een probleem vormen een terminal zonder geavanceerde grafische weergave doet gemiddeld 100 kb per seconde piekbelastingen boven de 1 mb per seconde zijn normaal printen maar bijvoorbeeld ook usb sticks vormen een uitdaging printopdrachten van 100 mb zijn niet ongewoon maar wel lastig als je in een pand zit dat bijvoorbeeld met een sdsl verbinding aan het centrale netwerk hangt ik denk wel dat deze technologie de toekomst heeft maar hij is zeker nog niet uitontwikkeld
227687 hoewel het steeds meer komt is vdi nog niet doorgebroken hoewel hiermee een goede stap gezet kan worden in de richting van working anywhere zie ik bedrijven het niet snel doen omdat het een grote investering is vdi biedt een ge soleerd systeem waarbij je er dus voor zou kunnen kiezen om de eindgebruiker alles op zijn eigen desktop te laten instaleren zonder dat anderen er last van hebben de vraag is dan of het niet een andere vorm van beheer vereist want ten opzichte van het reguliere beheer geeft het een grotere vorm van centralisatie van systemen steeds meer en meer zal er remote gewerkt worden en steeds meer wordt de systeembeheerder verwijderd van het persoonlijke contact met de klant al met al ben ik een beetje in dubio vdi is in potentie een goed product of het slaagt ligt aan de manier waarop het toegepast gaat worden
227688 vdi is meer dan een hype ondanks dat het nog niet echt is doorgebroken de grote bedrijven als microsoft vmware en citrix leveren goede oplossingen en een speler als 2x levert een goede prijsbewuste oplossing die zeker de moeite waard is voor klanten levert het enerzijds een besparing op maar veel belangrijker het levert een continu beschikbare client op de client is bijna monkeyproof voor gebruikers levert het een heel flexibele omgeving op mits goed ge mplementeerd juist in de implementatiefase gaat het vaak mis onjuist ge mplementeerd wordt het al snel een bottleneck in je omgeving ik heb zelf de vdi training van vmware gehad en was erg verbaasd wat er allemaal nog bij komt kijken om het goed te doen voor de klant is het een goed concept waar zeker geld mee te besparen is maar zorg voor een goede implementatiedienstverlener
227689 vdi is zeker een groeimarkt voor komende tijd ik zie dat de interesse vanuit de markt er zeker is maar dat er te veel naar de kostenbesparende aspecten gekeken wordt ik denk dat dit een verkeerd uitgangspunt is om te kijken naar vdi en het zal zeker ook niet de doorslag geven om vdi te implementeren het is meer een oplossing die gaat samenwerken met de traditionele omgevingen en dus naast de bestaande infrastructuur zijn sterke punten zijn de voordelen van centraal beheer en het snel uitrollen van nieuwe werkplekken ik denk dat vdi een product is dat we de komende tijd veel gaan tegenkomen
227690 op dit moment is vdi als concept meer een tussenoplossing voor veel bedrijven zal het complementair zijn aan hun server based computing omgeving en niet per se concurrerend waar de meeste ict managers maar zeker ook de business managers van dromen is een homogene omgeving die off en online kan werken en daarmee overal beschikbaar is of beschikbaar gemaakt kan worden perfecte uniforme ontsluiting tot alle applicaties die de eindgebruiker nodig heeft tot die tijd moeten we het doen met de beschikbare infrastructuurproducten en die zijn zeker niet slecht er ontbreekt echter hier en daar nog wel voldoende integratie om acceptatie door het bedrijfsleven vanzelfsprekend te maken een implementatie van een virtuele desktop waarbij al deze producten ingezet worden moet ik echter nog tegenkomen kostentechnisch gezien is dat namelijk een slechte oplossing
227691 vdi wordt steeds vaker genoemd als oplossing en komt steeds vaker op de roadmap te staan de voordelen van vdi zijn onder andere security beter in staat compliant te zijn en een betere manageability ook zaken als een thuiswerkplek zijn makkelijker te realiseren en de migratie naar vdi is relatief eenvoudig om de kostenbesparingen te halen die vaak worden genoemd zijn er diverse randvoorwaarden het betekent dat de infrastructuur aan de juiste eisen moet voldoen qua bandbreedte storage en tooling het betekent dat de kwaliteit van beheer op een hoog niveau moet staan het vraagt om meer kennis dan standaardbeheer in sommige gevallen is een groot voorbereidend traject nodig voordat er kan worden begonnen met implementatie een goede architectuur is hierbij nodig de toekomst van vdi ziet er heel goed uit en zal binnenkort ook niet meer weg te denken zijn
227692 vdi is mijns inziens zeker geen hype sterker nog ik denk dat het op dit moment de enige manier is om de uitdagingen die alle bedrijven hebben op het gebied van beheer stroomverbruik ruimtegebrek in het datacenter koelingsproblemen etc op een effectieve manier te lijf te gaan belangrijk bij elke vdi oplossing is dat deze zo min mogelijk moet ingrijpen op de bestaande infrastructuur applicatie onafhankelijk moet zijn en naadloos met bestaande applicaties moet kunnen integreren het artikel refereert aan oplossingen van citrix en vmware op ons kantoor gebruiken wij al zon acht jaar de sunray als desktop en onze vdi oplossing wordt regelmatig ge mplementeerd bij klanten vdi heeft dus zeker een toekomst

227698 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
227699 given everything we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible

227719 he has a way of breaking it down so its understandable
227720 these are simple changes that will make a big difference to patients at the end of their lives
227721 historically doctors have been encouraged to back away from patients when they enter hospice but this keeps familiar people involved
227722 plus its nice to have someone there who is not concerned with the hospices bottom line
227723 people are living longer and the end of life looks different than it used to
227724 the federal government wants to know what theyre paying for and everyone understands that
227725 good organizations are already doing most of these things so the effects on us will be minimal
227726 the new rules really should allow the hospices to meet the individual needs of each patient
227727 it usually will fall to the states and the individual doesnt have any way to enforce these rights
227728 will have to be very diligent about keeping up with what is going on
227729 our job is not to add stress at the end of life but to make it easy
227730 its a continuation of the trend weve been seeing moderate job declines overall and increases in total unemployment
227731 weve had some struggles with being able to train them ourselves and this was a good way to have volunteers run all week keeping them upright and theyre on two wheels

227735 the microsoft hyper v platform allows layered tech to deliver a category leading product that outperforms traditional vps offerings generally available in the marketplace
227736 these are full virtual machines with complete control over everything right down to the operating system customers now have a greater range of control than ever before combined with a much higher degree of security and reliability
227737 we are excited that layered tech is among the first hosting providers to bring dedicated hyper v based virtual private servers to market
227738 their offering combined with the tremendous advantages of a hypervisor based virtualization tool will help extend the savings realized through server consolidation and deliver on the vision of true virtualization in addition hyper v will enable layered tech to continue to run a heterogeneous environment by running both windows and linux on the same server using a single management interface

227750 i dont want labour so ill tactically vote for the 2nd lot
227751 i dont want a tory government so ill hold my nose and vote labour
227752 families are overstretched things look bad for the economy schools and hospitals dont seem to be improving rapidly enough despite all the extra money and hard work by staff
227753 labour and the tories cut people out theyre so used to being in power every few years they dont listen and they dont deliver our party is different it is a voice for people who want something different from politicians our party is full of people who are so much more than just politicians
227754 when we promise to make britain fairer we are talking about big tax cuts for those who are struggling paid for by more taxation on those who can afford it an end to the unfair and regressive council tax and extra investment in the poorest children from their first day at pre school right through to university
227755 when we promise a greener future for britain we have detailed plans to invest in clean energy instead of nuclear and get people out of their cars and into quality public transport
227756 when we promise to make politicians listen to people we will introduce fairer elections in which every vote everywhere really counts and counts equally and well end the influence of big money in politics
227757 when we promise to stand up for british freedoms we are proposing a freedom law to get the government off peoples backs and new privacy protection for our personal data we wont just be fair weather defenders of civil liberties when it is convenient or provides a good tv stunt
227758 so make it happen isnt just a dry shopping list of policies it is a fundamental statement about how we liberal democrats believe in different things and how we do things differently from the other two tired old parties
227759 the proposals in this document offer people individuals families and communities the power to make a better life for themselves we know that if we want britain to be fairer we are the only ones who will make it happen labour cant the tories wont we can and we will

227782 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
227783 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist

227786 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters

227810 this is the third time in just the last couple of weeks that congressman wolf has voted against hardworking americans and hardworking families in virginia and i have to say as a woman this particular vote is the most offensive to me

227825 the civil nuclear initiative is good for india and good for the world as we move forward toward our goal of sustainable development and energy security the peaceful uses of atomic energy will play an increasingly important role
227826 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create precedence and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapon activities refraining from adherence to npt and putting all nuclear material and facilities under the agencys comprehensive safeguards
227827 threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent

227832 but what kind of saint would really curse issueless women with the blessing of deformed children
227833 some of these children the handicapped ones especially are accompanied by relatives
227834 but begging gangs also look for poor parents who will sell them because they are a burden to feed and shelter

227852 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke is or whether that arm can reach me here
227853 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it

227884 this model has correctly predicted the winning party 12 out of 14 times
227885 the weak current state of the economy and the sharp rise in energy prices pose a significant headwind to the mccain campaign if voters weigh these factors similarly to how they have in the past

227916 this is classic johnson admits that myers has violated the umns code of conduct and then proceeds to tell us why he is being allowed to do so with a matter of academic freedom
227917 academic freedom is not the issue academic malpractice is for example section 10 21 b of umns tenure code explicitly says that a tenured faculty member can be terminated or suspended for unprofessional conduct which severely impairs a faculty members fitness in a professional capacity
227918 in 2001 this part of the tenure code was invoked against a professor at umn because he had images of child porn on his computer
227919 it is a sure bet that umn would not tolerate a white professor who worked a comedy club on weekends trashing blacks indeed it would say that such behavior disqualifies his ability to be objective in many respects myers is worse and that is why sanctions are warranted

228013 the kurdish political leadership is determined to protect the constitution and the principle of national consensus and work to advance the political process and the march of democracy in the country provided they do not come at the expense of the legitimate rights of the people of kurdistan
228014 turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed during a telephone conversation conducted with him thursday president jalal talabani expressed concern over the claim made by the annexation of kirkuk province to maintain the kurdistan region
228015 erdogan stressed his desire arrival of iraqi leaders to agree on district councils election law acceptable to all parties
228016 the proposal that was submitted on the proportion 32 of each essential component and 4 of aldo assyrians of kirkuk a proposal good support and solve a lot of problems
228017 this step does not consider itself a threat to the region but to join if no agreement is reached on the election law between the district councils and the kurdistan alliance bloc of other blocs
228018 renewed at the same time seeking consensus among the diverse components of kirkuk as it seeks simultaneously to the compatibility between the various constituencies in iraq
228019 do you find yourself racking your brain or scouring the web for that one perfect topic to blog about do you find yourself cursing out loud because you discoved that the topic you wish to discuss has already been covered by 6 354 other bloggers and at least six of them did a better job than you
228020 conduct contrary to the constitution reveals the ambitions of owning a response contrary to the will of the iraqi people
228021 the union held today friday morning an emergency meeting focused on the crisis of kirkuk province and reached attendees to fully convinced that the kurdistan regional government is trying to seize the oil rich preserve
228022 the kirkuk governorate to join the kurdistan region of iraq in the event no agreement is reached between the kurdistan alliance and other political blocs as the iraqi constitution
228023 we strongly reject this and if kurds tried to move effectively towards the annexation of kirkuk to the kurdistan region of iraq we we will organize a series of protest demonstrations and will soon send a delegation to the central government to urge them to respond to kurdish ambitions
228024 the province of kirkuk is not kurdish and it is not arab or turkoman but for all those components of iraq can not be unique to a certain point at the expense of marginalizing the role of other actors
228025 if these are the fruits of democracy democratic lame we oppose at the same time emphasize the need to keep the iraqi city of kirkuk where everyone lives in peace and call the kurdistan regional government not to rush again to take decisions with disastrous consequences at the level of the iraqi peoples unity

228227 it was my common sense that helped me defuse the bomb though i learnt only the basics of defusing bombs at the nsg i knew i had to do it
228228 i tried to cut a few wires with pliers but the thing will not come out immediately i asked one of my officers to get scissors and cut the wire later i removed the battery and the detonator
228229 perhaps this could have made those carrying the other bombs this was the first one drop them wherever they found it to be safe

228238 she has qualified she has a right to compete and she even has olympic accreditation which means she can stay at the olympic village
228239 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to offshore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real obama im john mccain and i approve this message
228240 given the magnitude of our challenges when it comes to energy and healthcare and jobs and our foreign policy youd think that wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears
228241 on energy policy i think there are some pretty dramatic differences
228242 one of the arguments against offshore drilling is that it will be five to six years before there is any production some experts in the industry would argue that thats not true that it could be there in a couple of years my position is that if it is five years and if we dont start now it will be five years from some later date so it should at least be one of the options that we look at and there is a big difference between the two candidates on that issue and whichever one is elected would have to contend with the feelings in congress
228243 john mccain is in favour of free trade and his votes in the senate have indicated that
228244 additionally whichever candidate is elected they have a congress that looks to be increasingly protectionist and we might not be able to deal with any free trade agreements in the immediate future
228245 i dont think we ignore southeast asia and it is more than just visits by important people from washington dc that makes the difference so id like to correct that misperception that we dont care we do care
228246 whoever reads soorat al kahf on the night of jumuah will have a light that will stretch between him and the ancient house the kabah
228247 whoever reads soorat al kahf on the day of jumuah will have a light that will shine from him from one friday to the next
228248 the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him said whoever reads soorat al kahf on the day of jumuah a light will shine for him from beneath his feet to the clouds of the sky which will shine for him on the day of resurrection and he will be forgiven his sins between the two fridays
228249 how my client could act against national security by himself in such a high secured place
228250 gholamhoseini is in evin prison in the sever charges with acting against national security as an afflicted worker just wanted to talk to the general director of vahed company and tehran mayor about returning him to the job
228251 judiciary officials have been taking hard on gholamhoseini by the order of detaining which is as hard as the charges have been brought to him because detention order should be the judiciarys decision for those who have been accused to murder
228252 acting against security at 4 00 pm on june 25 2008
228253 i was brought up in a country that relished fear based religion corrupt government and an entire white population living on stolen property that they murdered for and that is passed on from generation to generation
228254 i dont consider myself specifically political you know i think of working as an actor as being a human thing the concerns i have that fall into politics are human concerns
228255 she was in the process of becoming the biggest star in the world i just wanted to make my films and hide i was an angry young man i had a lot of demons and dont really know who couldve lived with me at the time i was just as badly behaved as her so i cant point the finger of blame

228258 we are in a good position to control the match tomorrow
228259 we have to repeat our performance take catches and bowl in the right areas as we did today if we take a couple of early wickets the tail will start
228260 we are happy with our efforts today but it would have been nice to get more runs in the first innings
228261 he mendis is a very good bowler and has got lot of variations bowlers like him are good for the game
228262 immediately once we realized that there was a security breach the port was placed on lockdown no vehicles in no vehicles out and what we did at the point we tried to locate the vehicle
228263 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
228264 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
228265 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
228266 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision
228267 but analog is still a rapidly growing part of the semiconductor business
228268 and there is really only one company that provides a soup to nuts analog system for wireless infrastructure products that company is
228269 digital chips which store data in ones and zeroes operate by differentiating between on and off signals
228270 analog chips by contrast process gradations and are able to process waveforms such as speech music and video so analog chips create a bridge to the digital world where data is stored and manipulated
228271 digital chips themselves are ill suited for communicating as digital circuits shrink to ever smaller sizes the value in the analog portion that doesnt scale well continues to rise
228272 a year ago i would not have recommended analog devices the company was struggling from 2004 to 2007 adi posted a 1 compounded annual growth rate in revenues and earnings per share
228273 during that time the company was a provider of handset basebands modems inside a phone which really became a commodity business it was also in the pc power management businesses which was also a drag on the overall growth of the company
228274 the good news is that during the first quarter adi got out of these businesses and has taken steps to move from single digital earning growth to double digit growth adi looks set to deliver double digit growth of 13 five year cagr much ofthat growth is coming from its communications business
228275 wireless carriers have been upgrading to third generation 3g networks over the past year and many now are focusing their sites on building fourth generation 4g networks as well as wimax networks
228276 with each move up the idea is to provide higher data rates allowing for more applications to run at once and for higher quality pictures and video as a result i think this stock looks very attractive
228277 the biggest part ofadis analog business is products for its industrial and communications business which account for 72 of revenues within this business adis wireless base station revenues grew significantly over the past year
228278 manufacturers of base stations which are radio receiver transmitters that serve as the hub of the local wireless network have been td scdma the chinese version of 3g equipment
228279 large oil discoveries in deep water off the coast of brazil has triggered another major long term round of contracts for the leading international drillers
228280 this bull market is accelerating and we must grab it by the horns now
228281 the brazilian find sits thousands of feet below the surface and only the major drillers can get to that oil other fields in russia the north sea and off the coast of indonesia require the drillers
228282 the order backlog has become enormous and following the brazilian offshore find will create an even deeper backlog its time to boost our allocation to the oil equipment and services companies
228283 the leading drillers in my opinion are still undervalued relative to their earnings prospects and one great company that still trades less than its projected earnings and cash flow over the next 12 months is dallas based ensco a premier global offshore drilling contractor
228284 its services are essential to oil companies in their worldwide exploration and development efforts its fleet of 52 rigs including six ultra deepwater semi submersible rigs under construction is strategically located in the most prolific domestic and international oil and gas markets
228285 in early 2001 esv completed construction of its first deepwater semi submersible rig which has proven to be a cost effective solution to deepwater drilling t
228286 he company has embarked on construction of six additional ultra deepwater semis the first is scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter of 2008 with the others following in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012

228288 on a day to day basis its things like eating a healthy diet taking exercise drinking alcohol in moderation not smoking that help us control our blood pressure
228289 this clarifies the amount of physical activity that should be targeted for achieving and sustaining this magnitude of weight loss but also demonstrates the difficulty of sustaining this level of physical activity

228296 teachers and trade unionists around the world care deeply about what is happening to our colleagues in iran we are carefully monitoring events and feeling a great deal of outrage that fair process and respect for trade union rights is so severely lacking in this case
228297 this verdict has been communicated to me and prison and judgment enforcement officials have asked me to write a letter requesting forgiveness the problem is that i have not committed any crime to ask for forgiveness
228298 they want to break my morale but i have to say i am doing well and my spirits are high my only point is that i have never been a member of any political party or group they want to use me as a scapegoat
228299 the charges demonstrate the commitment of everyone who worked on the case to find the alleged offender and now we will help the states attorney make sure justice is served
228300 i believe the agreement is good for india and good for the world
228301 we are of course approaching all friendly countries but we do hope that the nsg will similarly grant a clean unconditional exemption for india
228302 the deal is certainly important for india but its also important for the world at large because i think it meets the twin objectives of energy security as well as global climate change related issues and concerns
228303 and the concrete result of that i hope will be a comprehensive moratorium by all states that have nuclear weapons not to test them at any time in the future

228318 when you are trying to add to your squad you hope to do so prior to starting your competitive games
228319 there are teams who are not always prepared to let a player go before they know they can get one to cover
228320 so its not easy at this time in the season when you consider there are still four weeks before the transfer deadline

228383 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
228384 i think you are misinformed about when you say not one time
228385 ive been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the united states senate and worked to pass legislation to prevent it when i wan in the state legislature and i have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target african american and latino communities ive said that repeatedly number two jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that theres an injustice thats been done and we need to change it thats number two when sean bell got shot i put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem
228386 these are issues ive worked on for decades now that doesnt mean im always going to satisfy the way you guys want these issues framed i understand that which gives you the option of voting for somebody else it gives you the option of running for office yourself

228580 i think i learned more than anything how to battle adversity im the kind of guy where i have a chip on my shoulder and have tough skin a lot of times thats what you need in the fourth quarter to win games and i think i have that i have so much experience having to battle through adversity im never nervous im never scared
228581 his professional dreams began as a junior in high school during mater dei calif highs spring game brennan led a team of reserves against the top unit which featured matt leinart brennan snatched the spotlight outperforming his more decorated teammate with precision passing to lead the reserves to a stunning victory later that day brennans father terry came home and greeted his son with an eager embrace
228582 man if you can keep doing this you can play in the pros someday
228583 there were so many negative times for me and it was really unfair i was fighting through a lot of adversity my main goal at that moment was to play football i didnt care if i was going to be in the nfl i just wanted to play somewhere whether it was for a d i college a d ii college or in canada
228584 weight and hip issues also were a concern brennan weighed 185 pounds during senior bowl workouts in january approximately 40 pounds lighter than the prototypical size for the position in april brennan underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right hip and some predicted he would go unselected in the draft
228585 this is something ive experienced my whole life ive had to fight things since junior high into high school and well into college now im at the next level and it has never held me back from succeeding you have to turn it into good motivation
228586 those are things that you cant coach into a guy and hes got that a little bit about himself hes getting himself ready to play not just run plays its a good attitude to have
228587 his attitude has given teammates pause brennan quickly has gained a reputation as an antithesis to the stiff all business field general prototype he wears tights on the practice field he cracks jokes with veterans he plays the ukulele
228588 hes probably one of the most interesting rookie quarterbacks ive ever been around
228589 hes cool calm and collected i think the hawaii lifestyle rubbed off on him he puts me in the mind of a brett favre type guy its not the conventional drop back quarterback style he gets the job done
228590 brennan has embraced his new life but is cognizant of his past at the end of a recent morning practice fans leaned over a burgundy rail near the practice fields they held pens footballs caps stadium seats anything to lure the subject of their attention moments later brennan walked toward their outstretched arms and flashed a faint smile before signing autographs
228591 in football you set a game plan and you get out there and it all goes to shambles sometimes you have to be able to bounce back youll throw an interception or youll get sacked as a quarterback you have to be able to fight through the adversity more than anyone

228613 ramos has been following arshavin for a long time even when he was coach of sevilla
228614 andrei has already expressed his desire to move on from zenit and has also said that he wants to play for tottenham he likes the teams style of play and ramos style of management

228616 never trust a man who puts his words in the mouth of god and says its absolute truth its lies and it smells like death
228617 our world has grown weary of greed exploitation and division of the tedium of false idols and piecemeal responses and our hearts and minds are yearning for a vision of life where love endures where gifts are shared where unity is built where freedom finds meaning in truth and where identity is found in respectful communion this is the work of the holy spirit this is the hope held out by the gospel of jesus christ it is to bear witness to this reality that you were created anew at baptism and strengthened through the gifts of the spirit at confirmation

228661 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
228662 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
228663 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
228664 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
228665 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
228666 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
228667 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
228668 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
228669 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
228670 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
228671 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
228672 when she made it clear she didnt want to have anything to do with him he became enraged
228673 after they made a deal they were following her to another motel room when they were approached by three males from behind and forced into a room at gunpoint
228674 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
228675 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
228676 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
228677 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
228678 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
228679 give away contest for her one desire by kimberly killion
228680 no le entraban los drivers que tra a en un cd
228681 haha omg u know what i got damn shit for my maths whatever
228682 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
228683 were trying to get a hold of apple right now until we hear from apple its hard to say what the real reason is because if it was at amp t well at amp t is not the iphone service provider outside the us
228684 were not quite sure why apple took down the netshare application yet weve received no communication from apple thus far
228685 netshare did not violate any of the developer or appstore agreements were hoping well get some feedback from apple today sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time
228686 well do our best to try to get the application back onto the appstore if at all possible at the very least we hope apple will allow it to be used in countries where the provider does permit tethering
228687 the item youve requested is not currently available in the us store
228688 this should never have been even accepted for consideration let alone allowing it to go to sale
228689 i do wonder if apple is actually testing or examining the apps before posting them to itunes
228690 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future
228691 mr lutfi and mr spears have mutually agreed in private that no hearing or order is necessary at this time
228692 during the temporary conservatorship the conservators have the power to insure that lutfi will not harm britney anymore
228693 if mr lutfi makes any future attempt to contact britney after the temporary conservatorship has concluded britney has made clear she will take all appropriate legal action
228694 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
228695 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics

228726 hab a peores y hab a mejores es un rival de nuestro nivel la eliminatoria est al cincuenta por ciento soy muy optimista hay que jugar los dos partidos 180 minutos y la ventaja de campo es importante la vuelta en casa es una ventajita que podemos tener
228727 al final el schalke tambi n debe estar preocupado sabiendo que la vuelta es en madrid y que somos un equipo que estamos creciendo que estamos trabajando que hemos fichado bien y que llevamos un par de a os intentando volver a los primeros planos es un rival para volver a los primeros planos
228728 vamos a comprobar si neuer est lesionado que es un gran gran arquero y eso marca diferencias luego tiene dos o tres jugadores croatas importantes parece que est lesionado rakitic y no s si klasnic tambi n rafinha est en beijing como el kun ag ero han fichado a farf n que es un delantero importante est altintop
228729 es un equipo como el nuestro ha sido tercero en la liga alemana tiene experiencia en la champions ha sido campe n de liga y copa en su pa s es un rival duro los alemanes son fuertes estamos como ellos seguramente
228730 obvio estoy muy contento con la oportunidad que me est dando el t cnico de la selecci n y m s comprometido con el trabajo con lo que he estado haciendo porque gracias al trabajo que he hecho aqu es por lo que se da esto y habr que trabajar todav a much simo m s para seguir en el gusto del t cnico y aprovechar la oportunidad que se me da
228731 tal vez no despu s de un partido tal vez no pero f sicamente futbol sticamente yo estaba mejor me sent a mucho mejor en la cancha entonces sab a que de una u otra forma a lo mejor en alg n momento se me podr a dar no ten a la certeza de que se diera ahora pero con el trabajo que estaba haciendo a lo mejor se me pod a dar
228732 a cualquier futbolista que le preguntes le encantar a estar hasta el mundial pero depende de uno de c mo est s ir respondiendo y el trabajo que hagas
228733 ser a dif cil hablar de eso realmente yo creo que hay que ir paso a paso desde mi punto de vista se dio la oportunidad de ir hay que aprovechar tengo que trabajar al m ximo y ah en base a lo que hagas es lo que puede pasar
228734 la central es una posici n de mucho riesgo es una posici n en la que el equipo depende mucho de t pero todav a no sabemos vamos a presentarnos ah con el t cnico saber qu es lo que quiere y ah ya sabremos en qu posici n me tiene contemplado y en la que te ponga tratar de hacer las cosas lo mejor posible
228735 para m faltar an otros de aqu pero creo que me agrad el llamado de diego creo que se lo ha merecido al menos desde que yo llegu ha hecho un esfuerzo se ha consolidado en la defensa como lateral o como central entonces es un tipo vers til que le puede dar mucho a la selecci n y en lo personal me agrada
228736 yo se lo recomiendo y le digo ste muchacho puede jugar de lateral porque acu rdense que l no juega con carrileros no existen entonces diego aqu lo estuvimos utilizando de lateral entonces simplemente le dije ste muchacho le puede servir de central o lateral seg n como la vean
228737 no la s lo nico que me acaban de avisar es que es diego oficial me s otras que sacaron ustedes los medios pero ciertamente no la s pero de todos modos ni me pregunten porque no voy a opinar opino de mi jugador que me dio mucho gusto
228738 si no pasa nada antes del 31 de agosto me quedar aqu
228739 siempre est encima de los jugadores y que sigue los entrenamientos con mucha atenci n
228740 si no pasa nada antes del 31 de agosto me quedar aqu
228741 justo premio para ellos y la instituci n porque con esto demuestra que chivas sigue siendo la cantera m s importante de m xico para las selecciones
228742 de ninguna manera contra tecos y barcelona tenemos que llegar al cien por ciento seguramente lo que ellos hagan en la semana con la selecci n y nosotros ac no ser problema para hacer un buen partido contra monterrey
228743 siempre he sido chiva de coraz n y ahora que van a jugar ante tecos les vine a desear suerte
228744 voy a ver si no hay inconveniente de subir al ring con la camiseta para que toda la afici n se d cuenta de que soy un chiva de coraz n
228745 llego en mis mejores condiciones me he preparado bien y estoy seguro de que el campeonato se quedar en casa
228746 la verdad que me siento mejor a lo que me sent a la semana pasada estoy con mucha m s confianza estuvimos hablando con el t cnico y la idea es tratar de ir sumando minutos e ir agarrando ritmo el ritmo lo agarras dentro de la cancha
228747 yo estoy para tratar de sumar lo que pueda la gente esta esperanzada pero est esperanzada en todos en el equipo en tigres as que yo de mi parte tratar de dar lo mejor estoy trabajando para eso despu s los resultados dir n todo

228750 si bien reci n hace una semana vengo haciendo futbol en la pretemporada no he jugado no he jugado un partido siquiera amistoso as que vengo haciendo a lo que es entrenamiento
228751 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
228752 it is the first time i know of that a pregnant womans body has been equated to a meth lab
228753 i hate to see a young mother put in prison away from her child
228754 but if she could be put in a treatment program with her children that would be the best course maybe we need to revisit the legislation
228755 this is an opportunity to get treatment and assistance to a mother whose addiction is so bad she has chosen to take illegal drugs while carrying a child
228756 i made the biggest mistake of my life and did some drugs with her father right before i went into labor unaware i was about to have her
228757 i get out and i have a child whos 1 its hard to adjust to being the mother
228758 i decided to get this over so she wouldnt remember
228759 if we prosecute pregnant women who use any kind of illicit substance we are opening the door to other prosecutions
228760 weve got a small community that has a very bad drug problem
228761 when a child is born and lives a few minutes because the mother was addicted to methamphetamine thats a very very serious crime here
228762 i was just preparing a brief keep studying youre going to need it apparently
228763 in the heller case scotus declared an individual right to keep and bear arms in your own home for self defense subject to reasonable restrictions
228764 but for you to compare the us to a regime that purposely attempted to exterminate a group of people based on their religion that is asinine and you should be ashamed
228765 we have an excellent relationship with apple in the uk we have a multi year exclusive partnership with apple which we are only one year into

228781 he kills us every time we play him having him in their lineup makes every hitter around him better with him and david ortiz it was pick your poison if you are a yankee fan you have to be excited big time
228782 obviously he is a great hitter i am happy i dont have to face him anymore
228783 nothing surprises me about boston not too many players leave there happy its very well documented going back to mike greenwell roger clemens mo vaughn and nomar garciaparra
228784 they were the best 3 4 hitters in the league since 2003 when ortiz finally started playing more they were pretty deadly
228785 bay is a pretty good hitter i dont know if there is a lot of drop off there
228786 it may be doom 4 or it might not be doom 4 or it may be doom with a subtitle or something descriptive of the setting
228787 its good news that there are new sources of financing but we have to be very careful in order that this new financial help does not destroy the original policies of the bretton woods institutions that aim to cancel debt
228788 we decided to set aside a day to talk about non traditional financing sources that is china india brazil and sovereign wealth funds in order to clarify the way the imf and world bank appreciate the interests of these new sources of financing in africa
228789 the china development bank is willing to share its experience and provide financing to agricultural development in africa
228790 a big concern is debt lots of debt has just been wiped out and now with china coming are we going to see a new cycle prices of oil and other resources are high at the moment but if prices drop african countries will still have to pay interest on loans from china
228791 we are for transparency the meeting aims to clarify the position between traditional and non traditional financing sources but most important is that africa has to give its position to these non traditional sources to tell them what they have to do for us
228792 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
228793 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
228794 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
228795 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

228807 i was like well i really didnt need manny there it definitely would have one hopped third hopefully one of these days we can see the overhead of that play and just kind of see how everything converged and happened its pretty funny
228808 it doesnt matter how things go for you were not going to give up were just going to go and play the game like ive said and move on if it doesnt happen so who cares theres always next year its not like the end of the world or something why should we panic

228832 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
228833 for a long time people were saying use debit instead of credit
228834 there are very defined rules about how defective merchandise would get handled and you have rights you dont have with pin
228835 if theyve had other transactions where theres been fraud in the past we will take that into consideration
228836 if a thief steals your pin they can go to an atm
228837 you have to make sure you have enough money to pay it back
228838 have you talked to puff about his rapping or his dancing for that matter
228839 we have been informed that 16 students died and 27 were injured we think that there are still four or six more children under the rubble
228840 todays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds nonproliferation regime
228841 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create precedence and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapon activities refraining from adherence to npt and putting all nuclear material and facilities under the agencys comprehensive safeguards
228842 threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent
228843 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible
228844 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
228845 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us

228850 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it
228851 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression they are wrong and acting without approval
228852 half of our political action committee contributions are to members of each party
228853 we regularly educate our associates on issues which impact our company and this is an example of that
228854 we stand ready to work with the new congress and whoever is elected president
228855 we wrote reports and made many recommendations to the government after the 2005 cholera outbreak but none of them were ever implemented and so we are left to start all over again
228856 everyone builds their own wells in this country and they can only afford to build cheap ones which then fall into a state of disrepair and allow toxins to pass through them infecting the well water
228857 it is always the same problem we do evaluations we do reports with lots of conclusions but in the end it often just comes down to lack of money and poor organisation
228858 they need to cover where they have travelled what is their main water source what they have eaten which markets they frequent whether they have participated in traditional practices involving food and drink
228859 we werent paid last month but we did get our salaries in may
228860 it is the governments responsibility to build up water infrastructure here and if they dont do it what else can we do
228861 why are people always left to fend for themselves in this country
228862 you simply cannot conserve marine resources successfully without talking to local communities
228863 people use these resources intensively their lives depend on them it is just not possible to conserve without looking at what problems the communities face
228864 madagascars conservation areas have traditionally been in wilderness regions with small human populations
228865 now with a push towards creating so many more protected areas they are increasingly going to be in places where they affect far greater numbers of people this calls for a whole new approach to the management of protected areas
228866 the people who live and work in an area feel it is their territory
228867 they do not they cannot be told by others what to do using a top down approach just creates problems it is better to start from the bottom and work upwards
228868 some villages are aware that resource degradation is a serious problem and they want to solve it but in some areas this is not the case we can guide and give advice but its not our role to impose marine parks or ban fishing in an area
228869 there are many problems here but first we need to help reduce fishing
228870 but to do that people need other work they need other jobs so they dont need to fish
228871 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
228872 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level
228873 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
228874 an arrow was launched through the heart of the npt today with the approval of the india safeguards agreement
228875 as a result of heavy hnded diplomacy india can benefit from nuclear help from abroad while keeping its weapons programme unchecked hypocrisy wins
228876 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with npt member states
228877 but it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
228878 green mountain energy company helped fpl grow sunshine energy to one of the top ten utility green power programs in the u s out of more than 800 such programs

228880 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
228881 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
228882 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
228883 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
228884 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
228885 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

228922 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
228923 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
228924 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
228925 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
228926 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

228943 all of the scientists there who worked with us were supposed to have been investigated and given polygraph tests
228944 i think the basic economics are changing peoples view on what they really want to have in their driveway as oil becomes more expensive people are putting a much higher premium on cost efficiency
228945 its clear to us that large numbers of people used to buy large suvs and pick ups and i dont think theyre going to come back to that category given the high cost of energy

228948 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
228949 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
228950 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation

228957 unfortunately this was exactly the practice that comcast was engaging in with their own subscribers internet traffic
228958 the truth is that the fcc does not know what comcast did or did not do
228959 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with the industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer applications
228960 our free practice programme went well and we have made progress the car was reacting well to the different set up solutions that we tried so i am quite satisfied with the days work the track changed a lot during the day and its quite a demanding place with lots of corners but i enjoyed driving the circuit and i hope things continue like this tomorrow
228961 another positive day for us the car started the day pretty strongly but we were able to keep improving it throughout both sessions this afternoon i was able to find a particularly good balance and focussed on conserving the tyres rather than going for a lap time i had a little bit of graining but things look very promising for tomorrow
228962 it was a typical day of practice with a lot of laps covered and lots of data to analyse this evening to be ready for tomorrow overall we improved the car and we are moving in the right direction we still have a few things to improve but if we can make the most of the final free practice session tomorrow morning we should be able to approach qualifying in good shape
228963 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition but clearly they are very quick i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better
228964 i got a phone call at dinner time and now i am on my way down to brands hatch

228977 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
228978 the economic stress and uncertainty that consumers may face over the next six to 12 months will likely result in a continuous period of slow new vehicle sales
228979 it is also unlikely that a pronounced rebound will occur in 2009 and conditions could actually worsen before they improve
228980 this is an unprecedented shift to make owning as affordable as renting

228994 im always going in half an hour before the players arrive because i have to set up everything
228995 but everything was ready so i just walked a little bit around this rather large room
228996 i thought i was alone just checking the mirrors and somebodys looking back at you so i was a little bit shocked
228997 then the danish assistant coach came and i said there are some guys here
228998 now they started to talk a lot and use the telephone and started taking down their cameras because there were two video cameras on the other side of the mirror but they wouldnt unlock the door
228999 after half an hour we succeeded in opening the door
229000 but we didnt ask because of course we didnt know what had happened with the spying
229001 there was this guy in a building close to the field with a camera
229002 we saw him in the middle of the training the danish staff told fifa officials that he was there and they got him out of the building then later we discovered one more but they never did anything about him
229003 they provoked us and maybe thats what they were trying to do did they want us to see them or not its difficult to say

229009 thats fresh news he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before
229010 his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story

229019 surprisingly we found that methadone kills leukemia cells efficiently we never expected that
229020 provide the foundation for new strategies using methadone as an additional anticancer drug in leukemia therapy especially when conventional therapies are less effective
229021 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments fail which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
229022 in our lab we found that we also can kill solid tumors

229024 i was talking to one of his ex girlfriends not too long ago and she was texting him the whole way back from edmonton until 10 minutes before this accident happens
229025 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
229026 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
229027 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the suspect was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
229028 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
229029 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
229030 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
229031 the suspect came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
229032 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
229033 my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up
229034 caron said his three children all loved mclean who he described as a quiet easy going guy
229035 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy
229036 hes always been a quiet guy just kind of socialized with his buddies and that was it
229037 i can tell you that the state of the infrastructure in the nation today is improving albeit slightly it is improving
229038 im comfortable telling you today that we should not have another incident like that
229039 the item youve requested in not currently available in the us store
229040 but there will be an opportunity for public comment after we have a text and before new zealand ministers are asked to make a decision
229041 what we are seeking with the present consultation is information from the public on what should be the focus of new zealands participation in acta what should new zealand be trying to achieve through participation in the negotiations and what matters should new zealand seek to have covered in such an agreement
229042 we had the first meeting earlier this month of proposed participant countries
229043 we should finish discussing border protection and start on civil enforcement after that theres criminal enforcement and other bits and pieces
229044 we dont believe you we cant and wont help you so just go away
229045 this is inconclusive were protecting you from yourself go away
229046 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
229047 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
229048 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
229049 the ultimate goal is to find new ways to help people like the armed forces and first responders stay alert and on top of things when they have to be awake for extended periods of time
229050 we have drugs now that can keep people awake but theyre addictive and lose their effectiveness with repeated use this research should help us find methods for maintaining mental acuity that have more specific effects are less addictive and retain their potency
229051 this tests the flies mental capacity in two ways first theyve got to remember that the lighted vial is the one that has quinine in it and then theyve got to suppress their natural instinct to fly toward the light
229052 using this gene and other related genes we may be able to find better ways to boost performance for someone like a relief worker whos had to stay awake for six straight days trying to save people trapped by an earthquake
229053 i want to emphasize though that this type of treatment would just be for people who absolutely have to stay awake
229054 its not about trying to cram too many hours in your day everyone else should just suck it up and get a good nights sleep
229055 ashley and mary kate take readers on a journey through their celebrated young lives pausing to reflect on what has helped shape them into who they are today

229069 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
229070 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
229071 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq

229127 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
229128 obama has always said that iran must end its illicit nuclear program

229184 it is not so much that charter schools are that much better in my home state of arizona thereve been charter schools that have failed but they provide the competition that increases the level and excellence of education in every school and i want if i may summarize it in a personal way i want every family in america to have the same choice cindy and i had with our kids and that is to send their children to the school of their choice
229185 but earlier this year in april you made comments about mudslinging how it had been affecting other campaigns and how you didnt want to do that but recently especially last week when obama went to europe it seemed like there were a lot of campaign ads that you had put out that were doing that and the one yesterday comparing him to brittany spears and paris hilton like i was like okay so it seems like to americans like me and other people you might have flip flopped on what you had said earlier and what is your response to that
229186 were proud of that commercial we think americans need to know that i believe that we should base this campaign on what we can do for americans here at home and how we can make america safe and prosperous and thats the theme of our campaign i thank you

229200 to quote african american writer james baldwin anything that cannot be faced cannot be fixed
229201 there are three important myths being pushed by the bush administration in the press and in speeches
229202 first that iran has developed an illegal nuclear program but the fact is the united states started irans nuclear power program in the 1970s and iran has simply continued the u s sponsored program there is absolutely no evidence that iran is developing nuclear weapons as the international atomic energy agency iaea reported on may 26
229203 the newest argument is that iran is responsible for american deaths in iraq no evidence has been provided to prove that
229204 neither the united states nor iraq has displayed any of the alleged iranian originated arms to the public or press and lately it is looking less likely they will iraqi officials lately have backed off the accusations against iran a plan to show some alleged iranian supplied explosives to journalists last week in karbala and then destroy them was canceled after the united states realized none of them was from iran

229253 we come here off the back of two rather difficult races and our target here has to be to extract the full potential of our package and then try to secure the best possible result
229254 fridays results always have to be looked at with caution especially at a track like the hungaroring which is always very dirty on the first day clearly we are up against some very strong opposition on a track where historically we have usually struggled a bit but i am confident we can have a good race
229255 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition but clearly they are very quick i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface we know in which direction we have to work and we will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident all the same
229256 we worked on various set up options for the car i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail the situation is not too bad the car handles better but our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race

229272 i guess many drivers had trouble with graining so i dont think i was the only one but i found the balance of my car really poor we made several changes during both sessions but they didnt lead to the progress we wanted for the very last outing we then made major changes and luckily this proved to be a step in the right direction im happy we tried this because we now know a lot more
229273 we did the usual friday programme we evaluated the tyre compounds and worked on the cars set up in order to find out how the car and the tyres behave on this track we will now analyse todays data and prepare for saturday
229274 we didnt start the day quite the way we wanted and had to make several changes throughout the sessions in order to find the best direction for us
229275 we definitely went the right way with the changes and have made some good progress with the car tyre wise we have yet to make our decision its not immediately clear which option to go for but well analyse that tonight once again the competition is looking quite strong especially the renaults
229276 our pace wasnt where we wanted it to be in the morning session so we made a few changes in the break between sessions the changes worked better for us as we certainly found some more pace in the afternoon we still have some work to do this evening to make sure we get the best from the car tomorrow i also know that i have to do some work to improve my pace as well
229277 a busy day for the team during which we worked through a number of set up changes on both cars throughout the course of practice the main area that we have to focus on here is qualifying its almost impossible to overtake around the hungaroring so a good qualifying position is key to a successful result on sunday the drivers and engineers will now spend tonight working through the set up to get more performance out of the car
229278 overall we had a good day today which enabled us to further understand the new rear suspension that we will be racing for the first time this weekend
229279 we made some positive changes after the morning session to improve the car as i was not happy with the balance when we had very low grip at both ends the changes ensured that the car was a lot more responsive this afternoon and an improvement over how it has felt for much of this season our long run pace is looking okay but we have further work to do over one lap as the balance is not quite there yet
229280 it has been a challenging day today which we expected as we continue the set up work with our revised rear suspension and new aero parts once the track had improved this morning we worked on getting the right balance on the car and conditioning the tyres unfortunately we struggled with understeer and we need to look at the data closely this evening to confirm our direction before qualifying as the lack of overtaking opportunities here makes it important to get a good grid slot
229281 this is always a demanding circuit for the brakes and engine due to the high ambient temperatures and low average speed we also need to be mindful of the fact that we are expecting an equally hot weekend in valencia in three weeks time therefore engine management will be particularly important here the nature of this circuit calls for the bridgestone soft and super soft tyre compounds with which we will need to maintain a balance to prevent graining and overheating beyond that the heat will make this a tough race for the drivers however ours are well prepared for these conditions
229282 this morning was the first time i have driven here since the track configuration was changed so i was finding out what its like in a formula 1 car that went okay this afternoon it was the usual programme of evaluating the tyres with different fuel loads the track rubbered in quite a lot towards the end and as i did low fuel runs earlier in the session this did not show in our later lap times i was struggling a bit on the option which i had expected as this track changes a lot if you dont have a major problem with the car its best to leave it alone and see what happens on the second day otherwise you make changes to the car which are not appropriate for the saturday conditions you have to be patient
229283 i had hydraulic problems in both sessions a shame because i lost a lot of track time and fridays work is very important i hardly ran at all and therefore we are lacking information which will be a handicap for the rest of the weekend obviously this means the data from the other car will be twice as important as usual i will try and learn from sebastien but relying on your team mate is never as good as finding your own way around the track hopefully i can catch up a bit tomorrow morning
229284 weve got some work to do tonight to try and work out where we can find some more pace in the car
229285 we had a good run in terms of laps completed but it would always be nice to be a bit quicker well be back tomorrow and will do our best
229286 a normal friday for us today making our tyre comparisons and getting used to the conditions i think its going to be very tight again in the mid group but well see how tomorrow goes

229300 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as the crusade but it has just as much if not more screaming than ascendancy the songs are longer and there are more vocal parts so i do everything from the lowest possible singing notes i can do to the highest halford wannabe notes and everything in between and the same goes for all the screaming because we felt the music called for that stuff
229301 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest shit weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed

229312 i think mr krslovic has chosen the most honourable course of action and i commend him for what he is doing here
229313 i will not be attending the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose last week i realized it was impossible to gain enough support from the large institutions to win a majority of the yahoo directorships in todays corporate governance system where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions realizing i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight where little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both camps and the end result would be no better than the compromise that was reached in fact in winning a minority position on a board by a fight to the end you always have to be concerned that you may be boxed out by the majority that remains on the board committees can be formed that you are excluded from and you are given information only on a need to know basis an important part of my compromise with yahoo is that the board in the settlement agreement has agreed that any meaningful transaction including the strategy in dealing with that transaction will be fully discussed with the entire board before any final decision is made additionally if any committee is formed to negotiate a meaningful transaction carl icahn will be a member of that committee
229314 i knew that the value of the company was billions of dollars however the deceptive practice of hiding myspace financials by intermix management robbed shareholders of their opportunity to adequately gauge the companys value

229319 when corporal c m schultheis had retreated as far as he felt he could do so in safety and believing the suspect had a weapon concealed in his pants he fired at the advancing suspect from a distance of approximately eight feet with a total of 10 rounds from his service weapon of which nine rounds struck the suspect who was dead at the scene
229320 you better expletive shoot me your sic better expletive shoot me
229321 reasonably believed that the decedents aggressive actions represented a deadly threat to himself and that corporal schultheis use of deadly force under those circumstances was justified

229326 that dovbear just loves posting hyperlinks to stuff that many folks dont walk to talk about

229329 dovbear a man with his hashkafas in the right place that is assuming you think the right place is bashing chassidim superstition the zohar spirituality and kugel which i do
229330 dov bear has fantastic attributes candor loyalty truth courage a razor sharp mind and he flatters no one

229334 but under the laws that govern cleanup the navy is also required to implement practical historic preservation measures
229335 that comparison makes it easy for navy officials to recommend to their bosses stripping and coating over the demolition but it leaves historic mitigation unresolved
229336 a great example of how a community can work together to save a historic landmark
229337 comcast did not practice network management they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked consumers access to it
229338 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
229339 consumers must be able to both know and understand what theyre getting and what they are paying for

229343 to handle the amount of traffic and sales we anticipate it was prudent for us to take a step back to ensure we have a seamless integration and every piece fully tested and in place before we launch
229344 this also provides our vendors additional time to ramp up for the quantities of cd packages and books well require
229345 we had a great product and a strong field of bidders that led to an excellent outcome
229346 we did really well in april and by waiting until summer we allowed demand to build back up
229347 in a slow market for all types of condominiums nationwide it can take months or years to sell as many units as we did today
229348 between the two auctions and the individual sales in between weve sold 60 units since april and thats nothing short of remarkable
229349 investors rent space to students and capstone manages the project for them we had some people buying as many as four and five units today
229350 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services we also believe that the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
229351 that dovbear just loves posting hyperlinks to stuff that many folks dont walk to talk about

229376 hostility towards islam used to justify discriminatory practices towards muslims and exclusion of muslims from mainstream society
229377 the message that i thought was delivered to us was that they do not want him associated with muslims or muslim supporters
229378 discriminatory practices towards muslims and exclusion of muslims from mainstream society

229381 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
229382 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
229383 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
229384 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
229385 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
229386 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
229387 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
229388 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
229389 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
229390 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone

229393 the first objective is in the context of the framework convention on climate change to determine the factors of emissions in order to carry out an inventory of greenhouse gases released by the sector
229394 the countries of the developing south according to the convention must adopt measures but are not obligated like the industrialised countries to reduce their emissions that is why we want to know for the countries like new zealand that do have an obligation how much they emit and how they are going to cut emissions
229395 liquidation by frightened investors who are giving these united states of ours away
229396 a bull can make money a bear can make money but a pig never can

229413 neither harvard colleges administrative board guide for students nor the faculty of arts and sciences student handbook mention the ramifications of non academic plagiarism
229414 theres a sense among students today that if its something they can find on the internet then by definition they can use it freely without attributing it to anybody
229415 the full board hears all disciplinary and academic review cases violation of the alcohol rules disruptive conduct academic dishonesty and sexual harassment are typical of the disciplinary cases it handles
229416 i have found cases of academic dishonesty a few times in my courses i reported them to the administrative board for investigation as required by faculty rules

229423 it is a good exercise for your lungs this instrument didgeridoo is not difficult its fun

229425 there is a guitarist who plays just outside the au bon pain and he plays at night the music he plays fits the time and the place very well that really adds a lot to the atmosphere
229426 feels sad because some of them are homeless i always try to give them something each time i pass
229427 a part of harvards own kind of culture people come here they play it attracts the tourists you know you hear music on the streets thats good
229428 the american public knows that the congressional bans on drilling are artificially inflating their gasoline prices and shipping tanker loads of american wealth to unsavory regimes around the world
229429 the united states energy system has been built over more than 100 years and cannot be replaced overnight no matter how much some washington politicians want to wish away petroleum based fossil fuels the reality is that there is no feasible near term alternative
229430 expanded domestic exploration and drilling are essential to lowering gasoline prices america has plentiful oil resources now off limits and tapping those will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and strengthen our national security
229431 repealing the congressional drilling bans can quickly reduce gasoline prices as the market anticipates greater american supply in the near future hopefully the public will drill drill drill that point home to their congressmen during the five weeks that theyre back in their districts while this crisis festers
229432 if you get the right incident the american public will support

229443 if you get the gt gt right incident the american public will support
229444 it is important for us to ensure that the safety message filters down to every level of the workers
229445 sometimes complacency will set in and that will lead to accidents these accidents many of them are avoidable
229446 we have to ensure that their foreign workers health is looked after the place is hygenic and it doesnt create public health problems it is also important for us to ensure that their morale is high and will be able to be productive if they are given proper housing
229447 due to the plunge in stock market as well as concerns over dong high inflation and high interest rates all these have impacted the residential market prices have started to decline
229448 but in vietnam you have high interest rates now so costs have gone up and also a number of people who invested in the stock market have seen their wealth erode
229449 in terms of stock its got less than a million square feet
229450 for any mnc looking into vietnam they have less than ten good class buildings to look into and the majority of the buildings are virtually full
229451 overall we expect the office rental to continue to grow at a more modest rate of about 5 to 8 per cent on per annum basis

229454 one of the most inspiring things to see is how hungry kids around the world are to get an education

229474 i heard its because once you open a can you cant store the food in the can cause it will go bad my mom always puts things in a diff container too
229475 well once you open them the jalapenos you can keep them out and the will be good for a week or longer but it gets tricky once you put them in the fridge once you close the fridge the air is trapped and just circulates meaning that if things that are smelly or powerful in taste the other food in your fridge will smell amp tasted like other things amp also once something is in the fridge amp is pulled out amp gets to room temp over amp over is goes bad faster
229476 i think that anything canned should not be stored in the can after it is opened because it will collect bacteria faster

229478 green mark buildings typically would be slightly more expensive some of the materials you are sourcing such as recyclable materials are more expensive and not readily available so again it boils down to the cost as well as the timing a lot of developers are always trying to find the fastest way to complete a building at the most minimum cost
229479 was mainly attributable to lower sales from development projects in china

229553 i dont understand why so many people are surprised that this book is a failure pelosi is a vaccuous empty suit who represents an amoral left wing cesspool of a district
229554 the worst read in a long time couldnt she afford a better ghost writer should the american people take lessons from the leader of the 9 congress less time spent on book writing more time for the peoples business
229555 a weak book from a weak mind pelosi should stick to what shes good at whatever that is
229556 now i know why congress has a 13 approval rating
229557 i dont want my daughter receiving any messages from nancy pelosi
229558 we have the opportunity to restructure the program to make it more user friendly

229560 demand has been high weve been selling out every afternoon
229561 june apples fared real well and peaches are coming off real nice
229562 this is a night for america to stand together and to promote awareness safety and neighborhood unity
229563 national night out shows the vital importance of police community partnerships and citizen involvement in our fight for a safer nation
229564 kennetts first annual national night out is expected to be not only a chance for our community to take a stand against crime but also an opportunity for our citizens to get more acquainted with our city government
229565 with the help of an amazing group of people who have worked hard in planning this event it should prove to be an exciting night
229566 i would also like to give special thanks to jan mcelwrath who has devoted so much time in coordinating this event with me
229567 above all it is not only my dream but the wish of every hard working law enforcement official that we all stand up against drug dealers thieves and criminals and let them know that we are not going to allow them in kennett anymore
229568 please come out august 5th and join forces with the entire kennett city government and lets all send this message together

229570 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
229571 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
229572 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
229573 but the fight is far from over a duopoly market where phone and cable companies control nearly 99 percent of high speed connections will not discipline itself we look forward to working with the fcc and congress to ensure proactive measures keep the internet open and free of discrimination and accessible to all americans
229574 im here to help you mam why dont you wait in the car where its warm by the way my name is joe

229583 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
229584 im willing to give up some of my rights for security
229585 its unbelievable that a country the united states that many of us have looked to as the bastion of true freedom could now have eroded so many of the liberties we believed were upheld almost religiously
229586 you cant separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom
229587 it is not necessarily about what a conservative government should bring about or fund in the literary sphere although jeremy hunt mp has some good ideas on culture under the conservatives but the kind of literary culture that by free spontaneity and association will assemble under the conservatives
229588 publishers publish books they think will appeal to the public the article is absolute nonsense atlas is spinning rather than shrugging
229589 a different kind of culture will develop under the conservatives whether they instruct it or not and that this perhaps is what will underpin a change in literature
229590 how about mine being your first picking up papers tomorrow just need a person to sign forms

229598 adam is an artist who i would have signed to the label had i discovered him first he is a great young singer songwriter and performer and the big machinists are all very excited to be working with him his forthcoming album is going to turn some heads
229599 im really looking forward to a long relationship with the big machine family
229600 the team at midas records has been wonderful to me and ive made some great friends at radio as a result
229601 big machine brings so much to the table and with their help we believe adam is poised to make a major impact in country music
229602 it is a truly exciting prospect to be working with big machine and helping advance the career of adam gregory
229603 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
229604 das ist ein hammer los der schwerstm gliche gegner f r uns
229605 consumers believe that retailers like wal mart know the quality and safety of products they sell
229606 retailers benefit from that trust and must be held accountable for the products they sell
229607 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
229608 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
229609 i would like to recognize john lowrys important contributions to catalent over the last seven years and particularly the leadership continuity and focus he brought during our transition to a standalone company i am also pleased to assume an even more active role during this transition to help drive catalents future success
229610 discriminatory and not narrowly tailored to address comcasts concern about network congestion
229611 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
229612 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
229613 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
229614 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
229615 the fact is the fcc does not know what comcast did and did not do
229616 ironically todays decision may result in slow speeds for 95 percent of internet users
229617 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications blocking that communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop
229618 because most adults qualify for credit and are comfortable purchasing with credit cards they arent necessarily the ideal target for prepaid debit cards
229619 but teenagers who may not qualify for traditional credit cards and whose parents are likely uncomfortable with them spending on credit are the perfect target for prepaid debit
229620 because prepaid cards are a safe way to give teens experience using plastic they appeal to both parents and teens alike
229621 card issuers and banks might look at prepaid debit as a way to build brand loyalty and trust from an early age tapping into teen spending today and adult spending and credit tomorrow

229627 based on some intriguing preliminary studies in animals j timothy lightfoot a kinesiologist and his team at university of north carolina charlotte suggest that genetics may indeed predispose some of us for sloth using mice specially bred and selected according to their activity levels lightfood identified 20 different genomic locations that work in tandem to influence activity levels in mice specifically how far the animals will run
229628 is that there is a lot of investment from the roman catholic church in the anglican church cohering for a whole range of reasons the last thing they want to see is a church structurally split
229629 a really much more serious issue than the discipline or moral theological issues with which were wrestling
229630 while youre writing a report at the end of it you find that something different has taken place it may be that women have been ordained or a pope has died or an archbishop of canterbury has resigned were an evolving institution
229631 what is the faith is the apostolic faith something that was parcelled up and completed at chalcedon or is it something that is still emerging that is a theological question that is part of the wrestle thats an exiting thing that the two parties are committed to continuing
229632 its a multi layered role and its a role that in a sense each person creates
229633 part of creating it is getting to know people making networks listening interpreting and understanding then theres teaching running courses and developing the educational programs
229634 i suppose a great deal of what im taking into my role is stuff that i learned accidentally in melbourne i hope in some sense melbourne matured me and helped me to look for other interpretations explanations and nuances than the one that immediately hits you in the face and so i suppose ive gained a level of theological reflection of being able to talk to people get beside people and understand where theyve coming from
229635 what am i bringing to the role i think im bringing me who for nearly a sixth of my life was formed by being dean of melbourne
229636 khalid sheikh mohammads animus toward the united states stemmed not from his experience there as a student but rather from his violent disagreement with the u s foreign policy favoring israel
229637 i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about american pressure on israel
229638 archbishops bishops and other ordinaries in the federated states of canada in grace and communion with the holy see
229639 at the threshold or doorstep visits to rome in 2006 by the catholic bishops of canada note 1 three specific questions form the focus of this paper
229640 the mission of making disciples in all nations and of preaching the gospel to every creature
229641 believes it necessary to state clearly that the church while profoundly respecting the persons in question cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality present deep seated homosexual tendencies or support the so called gay culture
229642 erects or approves ecclesiastical universities and institutions ratifies their statutes exercises the highest supervision over them and ensures that the integrity of the catholic faith is preserved in teaching doctrine

229649 miliband has crossed the rubicon and is now in kill or be killed territory
229650 for all i know our navy was shooting at whales out there
229651 how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
229652 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
229653 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
229654 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
229655 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack
229656 rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9 11 is wearing off and the behavior pattern of citizens in both the u s and europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror
229657 so i can understand the argument for not writing something that was rejected uh maybe my attitude always towards editors is theyre mice training to be rats but the point is jejune if you know what that means
229658 american public if you get the right incident the american public will support bang bang kiss kiss you know were into it

229662 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai
229663 you will find folks who will say there is significant penetration of the isi by terrorist elements and thats a serious concern
229664 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom
229665 we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002
229666 overall the report looks to be broadly consistent with other data that show the economy quite soft basically stalled not growing very much but not contracting very much either
229667 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
229668 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
229669 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
229670 all of that stuff is sealed we have nothing we can talk about
229671 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
229672 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
229673 they will delight our readers who have followed the growth of the jolie pitt family
229674 and in three years theres only been a couple of days that its really been a washout
229675 the customer base has grown from three years ago to now
229676 our goal is to provide a great place for the community to come together and not just the harvard community but the surrounding cambridge community
229677 because massachusetts is actually very strong agriculturally we want people to see whats grown in our backyard
229678 sell direct trade chocolate meaning its a step beyond fair trade they actually go down to central south america and buy cocoa beans directly from growers and they grind the chocolate
229679 once we got some blueberries and they were so good that we ate them before we left
229680 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
229681 527 will send out some induendo like obamas life abroad really doesnt equate with life experience and his work with peoples civil rights doesnt give him a broad sense of americans
229682 a majority of americans believe that democratic candidate barack obama will win the presidential election against republican hopeful john mccain in november a fox news poll showed thursday while 51 percent say obama who is vying to become the first african american president will win the election only 27 percent are betting on a mccain victory a month ago 47 percent of americans believed that obama 46 would win the election compared to 32 percent for mccain a 71 year old arizona senator
229683 do we really want to elect a president who listens to ludacris and chose to play songs at his political rallies during the primary like 99 problems but a b tch ain t one
229684 his father was a black man from kenya and his mother a white woman
229685 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
229686 we ve voted for presidents since 1968 and have never seen a candidate more arrogant and filled with his own hubris than obama
229687 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
229688 some view the flag as a symbol of slavery others view it as a symbol of heritage personally i see the battle flag as a symbol of heritage
229689 should be lowered forever from the staff atop south carolinas capitol
229690 i hope mccain gets booed at the national urban league or that people get up and walk out
229691 you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
229692 obamas first reaction was restrained i didnt take it personally and i dont think he intended to offend he said
229693 later in the day after other african american politicians did take it personally obama issued a much stronger statement i didnt take senator bidens comments personally but obviously they were historically inaccurate he said
229694 in short obamas first instinct was to let the remarks go rather than use them to beat up on biden he recalculated only after other african american politicians reacted with less understanding
229695 eventually obama realized that anything less than condemnation would make him sound insensitive to perceived racism
229696 just remember that the the news media has the attention span of a fruit fly so this will fade as long as we dont lose another one
229697 clearly three percent lower gasoline demand is going to have an effect on downstream numbers at least until we see a real meaningful correction in the feedstock costs
229698 rates of infection among african americans and also among hispanics are much higher than among white women sixty four percent of women with hiv are black even though blacks only make up about 13 percent of the u s population
229699 education plays an important role because hiv is more prevalent in their communities women of color need to know they are more likely to be exposed to hiv
229700 all women should understand how to protect themselves such as limiting their number of partners and using condoms consistently
229701 physicians can explain to their patients that hiv screening is recommended for all adults now and that there are numerous benefits to being tested we need to continue to destigmatize hiv screening and make it a part of routine care

229707 approximately 50 percent of military participating in off duty education choose online learning courses due to their temporary duty deployments or just the need to have flexibility and portability as some days are 12 hour days while others may be shorter
229708 our student support system is what makes uwf stand out among other colleges and universities
229709 students have questions today and are deploying tomorrow we offer them immediate assistance to take care of whatever they need so they can complete their courses
229710 many military service members choose uwf because it offers an online program that provides them with the flexibility and convenience to start at one place and still continue their education despite being called to duty

229712 we have spent the past eight months conducting research and development on arabic language and culture
229713 weve spent time figuring out how to translate content into arabic creating virtual keyboards for arabic and developing instructional materials that will be used by distance learners who will interact with the arabic instructor each session through web conferencing software

229721 roquette americas generous and significant contribution along with hundreds of others will make this much needed community facility a reality
229722 our intention is to make a lasting contribution to benefit the people of the city of keokuk and the local region

229728 we value our partnership with the community and the local region
229729 the creation of a facility such as this will provide many opportunities to showcase local talent as well as great entertainment for everyone
229730 along with the checks we received so many notes and letters written by the donors
229731 people would write that they remember playing at rand park they would say they cant pay much but they were glad a new bandstand is being constructed and wanted to contribute
229732 the features electricity lighting etc will allow major groups individual concerts and dramatic arts
229733 the stage will be as large as the stage at the grand theatre

229760 ibm was the clear winner across the board maybe microsoft underestimated ibm and in some cases decision makers are more open to at least considering alternate solutions they might not have even entertained before which would be good news for ibm and jive in particular
229761 this bill will provide an important alternative to the way doctors currently get their information about drugs from the drug companies themselves
229762 by providing physicians with thorough independent research on all the drugs available to them we believe we can improve the quality of health care and reduce the cost of prescription drugs in america
229763 many doctors learn about new drugs from drug company sales persons who may not be objective
229764 studies confirm that when unbiased health professionals armed with educational materials provide guidance to doctors they are more likely to purchase the best drug for the patient instead of the best deal for the pharmaceutical company
229765 receive no support from any entity that manufactures products used to treat the medical conditions discussed or from any organization funded by such entities
229766 this section would basically disqualify the previous list of entities because many of these entities receive support for research sponsorship and education from manufacturers
229767 under the rubric of academic detailing the government can tell doctors whatever it wants about drugs while drug companies can only say what the fda allows
229768 sorry senator kohl but the government has a conflict of interest here and such a double standard turns the first amendment upside down the supreme court has been very clear that individuals and companies have a right to tell the truth about their products and that there is no such thing as truth imposed by government
229769 office calls work thats why they are the preferred sales tactic of industry so it makes sense that governments and others who actually foot the cost of prescription drugs should adopt the same tactic albeit with the goal of encouraging the use of the best safest most cost effective drugs

229781 how do we know if a private school accepting vouchers is failing
229782 this improved estimate means little if it does not serve as the spark to inflame our collective anger about the deadly neglect of an acute emergency this week president bush signed a new global aids bill but persistent underfunding and restrictions here at home tie our hands in combating the epidemic in our own backyard the time to argue whether this is a black epidemic or a gay disease is over its absolutely and distinctly both as we will see in this new data and if you are a young gay black man the likelihood that you will encounter hiv is staggeringly high even if your personal behavior is no more risky than people in other communities how many interventions has cdc developed to reach the diverse populations of gay men of african and caribbean descent in this nation who are facing some of the highest rates of hiv infection on this planet one and it has reached just a tiny fraction of the men in need if we lack the courage to demand develop and deploy a comprehensive and accountable national aids strategy that confronts the hard truths of poverty and bias that fuel the epidemic we dishonor the memory and struggles of all we have lost to this disease all who continue to fight for their lives in the face of so many challenges and all who will become infected in the coming days months and years
229783 buried in the release will be alarming new evidence that hiv prevention efforts in the u
229784 as with so many issues in hiv aids we do not have to hunt for a conspiracy to explain how we have found ourselves in this troubling state of affairs the damning evidence is right out in the open our country has no national aids strategy flat and then actually declining funding for hiv prevention persistent jesse helms era restrictions on proven means of effective prevention and the pernicious intersection of hiv and major social injustices such as mass imprisonment of the racial and ethnic groups disproportionately impacted by the epidemic as well as the sanction of bias against sexual and gender minorities shortly after this announcement senators mccain and obama will speak at rick warrens saddleback church where they will face questions on hiv aids will they take this opportunity to call out for bold measures in the domestic epidemic including a national aids strategy full funding for honest hiv prevention and groundbreaking research and an end to homophobic abstinence only until marriage programs or will they continue to relegate the domestic epidemic to the back burner of this campaign
229785 what we have now confirmed is that on the day this article will be published its likely that another american will become hiv positive about every ten minutes over a third of whom are under 30 years old will we point fingers at them and cast blame further fueling stigma or will we finally take a long unflinching look at a country that tolerates bullying and unrelenting violence against lgbt youth funds ideologically motivated programs in our schools defunds and suppresses research on sexuality and public health swells our jails and prisons by locking up unprecedented numbers of people from the racial and ethnic communities hardest hit by hiv and has never provided necessary hiv prevention education and tools to any significant percentage of the population the bottom line is that the hiv epidemic in the us continues to spread and at a rate greater than was previously thought the real measure of political leaders and the american people is if this bad news spurs good action the establishment of a comprehensive and accountable national aids strategy that will eliminate barriers to effective prevention generate adequate resources and hold our government accountable for ending this epidemic

229849 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody laying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
229850 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
229851 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers

229865 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
229866 preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
229867 this result adds to our understanding of the relationship between h pylori and stomach cancer and to the debate on how we should treat people with this infection
229868 the trial aims to recruit 56 000 people across the uk treat any who show signs of h pylori infection and follow them over 15 to 20 years to see if this treatment is effective
229869 i look in the mirror i see my hair is black
229870 thats uh interesting i guess you understand that you have green hair about as well as you understand that youre a terrible reporter
229871 discriminatory and not narrowly tailored to address comcasts concern about network congestion
229872 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
229873 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
229874 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
229875 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
229876 the fact is the fcc does not know what comcast did and did not do
229877 ironically todays decision may result in slow speeds for 95 percent of internet users
229878 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications blocking that communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop

229895 you try to want to balance between being optimistic and aggressive and not going into things that are just quackery
229896 i would certainly discuss it with the neurologists and if they thought it would be safe and wouldnt be a problem id try anything
229897 from a surgeons standpoint the main thing we use methylene blue for is we inject it into the patients veins and it turns their urine blue thats so we can find leaks
229898 in the end i decided the only way to win was to win to have a clinical trial that proves the point
229899 as a result ive already had several calls from my office saying is this available can i get this for my mom and dad
229900 its a fine line trying to give people the idea that theres hope out there in the field because there really is but also tempering the news based on the information
229901 weve read so many reports of things that were so promising and then we go and talk to the neurologist
229902 in the final analysis so far always they dont hold up to the original hype that comes out
229903 but there are so many of these studies that somebody has got to hit on one of these
229904 we have shown that b serrata enriched with akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee
229905 certainly osteoarthritis is in need of new safe analgesics although many effective therapies that reduce pain such as muscle strengthening exercises shock absorbing footwear and weight loss have very few bad side effects
229906 this report on treating knee pain with a chemical derivative of b serrata is interesting but the patient numbers are small there were some problems with the reported trial design and we need more information on its medium to long term safety
229907 when its time to announce such a title ill announce it so please look forward to it
229908 we all know where weve been we all know things have gone wrong but from this point on its about the future we have an opportunity to work together to win again
229909 i am absolutely clear in my mind that firstly we do not stand in the way of scots having their choice i do believe they will continue to choose to be part of the united kingdom
229910 but secondly there is no blank cheque for mr salmond for my support in relation to what his proposals are until i see the details of what he is saying
229911 murrays first serve at 39 2nd serve pts won at 36 not good enough
229912 what is murray doing his serve must be about 10 and hes hitting his forehand horribly
229913 murray will display the collingwood spirit and win this in three sets
229914 this match represents a great opportunity for murray not only to win but to lay down a marker to the rest of which most danger is in the other half i think moya will make it hard early days and a first set tie break could go either way but im backing murray to come through in three sets against a tiring moya
229915 some of the good counts we are seeing at pier 4 are related to the bird exclusion practices
229916 two years later we have our third annual sandcastle festival
229917 otherwise it takes a long time even to walk through and see all the creations
229918 even the amateur teams give the master sculptors a run for their money
229919 i remember as a kid creating a wedding in my sandbox with a big cake and stuffed animals
229920 it really really is one of those events i truly enjoy you sit on the beach you enjoy the music you enjoy the weather and you see the families come down to talk with the master sculptors who are such a great group of people

229970 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between all cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
229971 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large
229972 in our particular study a sixfold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
229973 our findings remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
229974 people who have or suspect that they have sleep apnea should consult their physicians about diagnosis and treatment options
229975 this australian data has additional strengths in that it is a population based prospective sample with a long period of follow up
229976 further work is needed to see if mild obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse effects and if continuous positive airway pressure treatment reduces cardiovascular risk in larger populations
229977 our findings of significant mortality risk with untreated sleep disordered breathing in conjunction with prior evidence that continuous positive airway pressure can effectively treat severe sleep disordered breathing underscore the immediate need for heightened clinical recognition and treatment of sleep disordered breathing

229982 when the fadaba beans are fresh in september we buy a years supply and freeze them so because the beans arent dried they takes less time to cook and we can remove the sausages from the pan after 40 minutes and then the beans cook on their own for another 20 minutes the shorter cooking time means less fat in the dish but we dont lose any flavor because the fresh beans absorb flavor more quickly than dried beans
