4540000 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4540001 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4540002 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4540003 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4540004 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4540005 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4540006 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4540007 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4540008 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4540009 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4540010 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4540011 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4540012 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4540013 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4540014 we are encountering a devastated country without institutions the first thing we are going to demand is a return to the normal and institutional functioning of the country
4540015 a frontal assault on corruption which is a cancer that corrodes the entire society
4540016 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4540017 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4540018 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4540019 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4540020 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4540021 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4540022 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4540023 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4540024 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4540025 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4540026 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4540027 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4540028 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4540029 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4540030 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4540031 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4540032 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4540033 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4540034 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4540035 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4540036 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4540037 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4540038 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4540039 the european union must be prepared to commit itself including on the ground
4540040 many countries have said that they are ready to join in
4540041 we are encouraged by what we saw this morning but we have to go through the united nations
4540042 you call it peacekeeping troops i dont call it that but controllers monitors european facilitators i think the russians would accept that
4540043 im convinced at the end of the day we will find an international peacekeeping force in the region with the eu at its heart
4540044 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
4540045 i do not think we should get lost today in long discussions about responsibility or who caused the escalation of the last few days
4540046 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
4540047 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki a russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4540048 the principal element the respect of teritorial integrity of georgia is missing
4540049 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4540050 it is clear that georgia wants this dispute to become something more than a short if bloody conflict in the region
4540051 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4540052 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4540053 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4540054 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4540055 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4540056 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4540057 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4540058 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4540059 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4540060 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4540061 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4540062 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4540063 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4540064 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4540065 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4540066 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4540067 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4540068 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4540069 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4540070 you can no longer remember a time when it was not so soon you wont remember not remembering
4540071 i will not disappoint slackercentral i will complete each slacking with total concentration and i will gain honor for slackers and for the slackercentral nation
4540072 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4540073 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4540074 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4540075 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4540076 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4540077 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4540078 we know the owner alexandre gaydamak cant keep funding it its not a bottomless pit so in the end we had to accept the offer for pedro
4540079 theres no money left for signings now but we have spent good money
4540080 the owner has backed me and i cant fault what he has done there are still great players here
4540081 we may have to sell another one to raise the money to buy but if another one goes thats another loan i need
4540082 we are short of three players that is what we need to be a squad who can compete on the domestic front and try to have a run in europe
4540083 i have to balance the books though i had great offers for one or two other players but they didnt want to move
4540084 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4540085 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4540086 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4540087 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4540088 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4540089 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4540090 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4540091 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
4540092 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
4540093 wal mart seems to be willing to break federal election law in order to stop their employees and all of americas workers from having a fair shot at the american dream
4540094 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4540095 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4540096 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4540097 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4540098 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4540099 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4540100 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4540101 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4540102 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4540103 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4540104 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4540105 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4540106 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4540107 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4540108 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4540109 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4540110 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4540111 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4540112 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4540113 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4540114 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4540115 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4540116 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4540117 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4540118 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4540119 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4540120 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4540121 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4540122 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4540123 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4540124 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4540125 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4540126 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4540127 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4540128 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4540129 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4540130 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4540131 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4540132 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4540133 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4540134 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4540135 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4540136 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4540137 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4540138 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4540139 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4540140 seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the united states and its democratic allies
4540141 seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the united states and its democratic allies
4540142 seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the united states and its democratic allies
4540143 every country is tired of war except for the us war including nuclear war is the neoconservative strategy for world hegemony
4540144 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4540145 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4540146 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4540147 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4540148 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4540149 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4540150 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4540151 if they can do it i would say go do it
4540152 our concept does not rely on any reuse of sediment
4540153 the community is looking for answers and the only way to get answers is for somebody to commit to a dollar figure with a proposal that is complete valid and viable
4540154 lafarge was the first in its industry to move into aggregates and concrete in a significant way over 10 years ago and to develop a unique expertise in creating value in the concrete business with this acquisition we are taking a pioneering step in the emerging indian market
4540155 twenty years ago that would not have been the case thats how far weve come
4540156 this is how to find out if these things really work
4540157 on behalf of lafarge i would like to extend my sincere condolences to china and to all those who have lost family and friends in this catastrophe since the earthquake we have been focused on helping our employees their families and the local communities around our plants affected by this tragedy at this difficult time lafarge is determined to do everything possible to support both its employees and the local population surrounding its operations

4540160 i wont run on a national ticket in 08 on live tv no further comment necessary for this lie
4540161 did i ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while i sat in church yes
4540162 would you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
4540163 i am a christian and i am a devout christian i believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of jesus christ i believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life but most importantly i believe in the example that jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful i didnt fall out in church as they say but there was a very strong awakening in me of the importance of these issues in my life i didnt want to walk alone on this journey accepting jesus christ in my life has been a powerful guide for my conduct and my values and my ideals there is one thing that i want to mention that i think is important part of what weve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e mails that have been sent out denying my faith talking about me being a muslim suggesting that i got sworn in the u s senate with a quran in my hand or that i dont pledge allegiance to the flag i think its really important for your readers to know that i have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years and i have never practiced islam i am respectful of the religion but its not my own one of the things thats very important in this day and age is that we dont use religion as a political tool and certainly that we dont lie about religion as a way to score political points i just thought it was important to get that in there to dispel rumors that have been over the internet weve done so repeatedly but obviously its a political tactic of somebody to try to provide this misinformation
4540164 it was such a strong explosion that even people at a 15 20 km radius heard it
4540165 when we saw flames engulfing the shade where some workers were having lunch we ran to douse the fire but someone shouted at us to run as the explosives were kept in the same shade the detonators went off and we were thrown away
4540166 there are stringent rules for the storage of detonators and other such material at stone crushing units
4540167 penndots interested in the technology and theyre putting out a number of pilot projects
4540168 we are doing these on lower volume roads and we want the pilot projects to have both the warm mix asphalt and superpave hot mix asphalt as a control
4540169 we are not far enough along yet to predict whether warm mix asphalt will go into general use across the state
4540170 we possess the necessary advantages to cultivate a rich working environment that encourages knowledge and learning
4540171 for example we recently created the corporate development department which will be responsible for putting together intensive training programs for all our employees in all specialties
4540172 se r e de las cicatrices el que nunca ha tenido una herida
4540173 as market leader increases by british gas would spark a chain reaction accross the entire energy industry
4540174 when you do a crime of that nature you have got to be held accountable
4540175 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4540176 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4540177 we told the world this is about starting an invasion
4540178 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4540179 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4540180 we need to do our utmost to deter such behaviour in the future
4540181 unfortunately today we are looking evil directly in the eye and today this evil is very strong very nasty and very dangerous for everybody not only for us
4540182 today paraguay breaks with its notoriety for corruption breaks with the few feudal lords of the past
4540183 will work boldly to obtain better living conditions for the peasants whether they have land or not
4540184 i just want him to get rid of the corruption and the inequality so we have a chance at giving my children a future
4540185 in the chaco the government never did anything for us
4540186 i think the board and the staff need to take this very seriously
4540187 it became apparent that several financial control and contract management issues had been overlooked at that time we sought and received authorization from the board to pursue an independent review by the auditor of public accounts of a project in which a possible discrepancy had occurred
4540188 the contract was very weak and was not protecting the commonwealths interest
4540189 ultimately the responsibility falls back to the office of agricultural policy
4540190 in the previous administration under fletcher that office was not providing adequate oversight and accountability
4540191 i am more in touch with the majority of the people in the county
4540192 were happy to report that all of our shipping centers are resuming normal operations after experiencing three days of significant issues
4540193 throughout the night and as we post this update our distribution centers are processing customer orders and getting them into the mail if a member should have been shipped a disc tuesday wednesday or thursday with rare exception it will ship today friday
4540194 taking aggressive steps to fully understand the root cause of this weeks problems and safeguard against issues like these in the future
4540195 if you could not be a judge in your obituary what would your next obituary say
4540196 i cant at this point in my life think about doing anything other than becoming a lawyer and judge thats why im at a liberal arts college to learn about other things but i never know when to stop i would be a loving partner to my husband a great mother and fantastic grandmother
4540197 you are an embarrassment to this school and all it stands for we do not believe that you belong in this community we ask that you give up your position on your own rather than having us take it away from you what you did was offensive to every person in this room including the dean you will be given 72 hours to clean out your office and the dean will personally finish up your classes you will not receive a recommendation from the school but you may appeal this decision to the professorial board or deans office if you wish thank you that is our recorded decision
4540198 failure to engage in substantive discussions on our all cash premium proposal prevented us from confirming for our financing sources the significant synergies associated with this transaction that along with our revised outlook and the present economic climate led us to conclude that financing terms for the transaction are no longer attractive for our shareholders we remain focused on executing our strategy of delivering holistic solutions that address our customers key challenges while ensuring that cadence operates in the most cost efficient manner
4540199 photography to the amateur is recreation to the professional it is work and hard work too no matter how pleasurable it may be
4540200 the fact is that relatively few photographers ever master their medium instead they allow the medium to master them and go on an endless squirrel cage chase from new lens to new paper to new developer to new gadget never staying with one piece of equipment long enough to learn its full capacities becoming lost in a maze of technical information that is of little or no use since they dont know what to do with it
4540201 anything that excites me for any reason i will photograph not searching for unusual subject matter but making the commonplace unusual
4540202 in western australia aboriginal women are more than 45 times more likely to be a victim of domestic violence than non aborigines
4540203 they cant get over their rage and its inhuman to ask them to get over it
4540204 sir the bishop of durham in his articulate letter aug 9 regarding the leaking of the williams letters makes some useful clarifications and i am grateful for his statements regarding dr williamss closing address at the lambeth conference as for why sic i decided to offer his letters to the public arena i have written to dr wright at length but suffice it to say that as events moved from gafcon to lambeth i became almost sure for various reasons that the liberals knew far more about dr williamss personal views than the traditionalists did and if so the balance should be redressed over the years i have shared the letters with only a few i had no desire to embarrass dr williams over his statements and i hoped that his personal views would change now that the issue of homosexuality in the anglican communion has become such a big issue i judged it was time to override my misgivings about making his views known anglicans can make up their own minds what to do with the information
4540205 liberals knew far more about dr williamss personal views than the traditionalists did
4540206 over the years i have shared the letters with only a few
4540207 i had no desire to embarrass dr williams over his statements and i hoped his personal views would change
4540208 i judged it was time to override my misgivings about making his views known

4540211 out new technology after doing a few shows telling my filmmaking stories i started getting wonderful emails and a bit of a following
4540212 i bring my experience to the table i also get industry leaders in from time to time to discuss their background and tales of the process of filmmaking hopefully listeners will learn from my mistakes
4540213 i did a tech review on a product i really knew little about i got called on it from listeners it taught me never to review anything unless i knew it like the back of my hand
4540214 i record on my macpro in ubercaster with a rode podcaster mic its easy and wonderfully efficient
4540215 our first podcast featured the director of who gets to call it art peter rosen
4540216 as well as the artists james rosenquist and larry poons
4540217 film forum has hosted thousands of q amp as with filmmakers since the 1970s
4540218 people who were unable to attend our events and are interested to hear more about the making of a film
4540219 there was a palpable emotional reaction from the audience when they saw riley emerge in the theater after a mournful ending
4540220 we record with shure wireless mics through a mixer into a sony cassette deck
4540221 then transfer from tape deck into cubase where its mixed and edited mastered in wavelab
4540222 because i wanted to capture some of conversations that i was having with people in other industries the niche is centered on the convergence of tech and storytelling how technology is enabling new forms of funding creation distribution and audience building
4540223 we are always looking to interview people doing interesting work
4540224 we dont just interview filmmakers but cross into all forms of storytelling such gaming music and technology
4540225 the freeform aspect of it made it enjoyable and the audience really responded well to it
4540226 in terms of raising the financing attaching actors etc i wasted so much time and money it was really quite sad
4540227 i felt film school prepared me so much less than the process of working on my first feature and i wanted to pass along what little i knew and learned
4540228 mostly younger independent filmmakers trying to figure out how they can get their films made and then seen although young isnt entirely fair because the age range varies
4540229 but sometimes the guest has no energy theyre introverted or nervous and it takes too much effort on my end to keep the conversation exciting and then its more about me then them
4540230 he was just an honest fun guy and you could see how and why he was successful
4540231 plus at the end he told a story about how he basically came within inches of directing a planet of the apes remake for fox at the age of 20 or something
4540232 agama adalah pola pikir cara berpikir manusia dalam memahami tuhan atau penciptanya
4540233 if you just look at the scrabble application wall its pretty clear that there are a few people who are angry enough at hasbro and ea to want to sabotage the game
4540234 not right now i have a very important conference call to make
4540235 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4540236 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4540237 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4540238 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4540239 my one great talent lies in making those who wrong me suffer horribly
4540240 de blob was the eye opener for us that we can make cool games and function as a good team the game definitely gave us the opportunity to start our own company
4540241 we always dreamed of designing an rts and when wii ware came out we immediately figured that this was our chance
4540242 i just liked it right from the start i like the fast flowing corners and there seems to be plenty of grip in the wet in the free practice it was dry and its a bit bumpy but my motocross helps there and i dont mind the bike jumping around a bit
4540243 i just enjoy this track fast corners and it seems to suit my style im looking forward to the race wet or dry
4540244 the first qualifying session was so bad i was so terrible
4540245 then in the second session i began to get a bit of feeling for the track and the grip and started to go better i moved up the leaderboard and my lap time is not so different from jd and the other guys around me so i am quite happy with that
4540246 i was pretty slow at first i just didnt have any feeling for what the track was like then i started to feel the grip and got going a bit in the end it was not too bad
4540247 it would have been nice to be fastest but there was no sense in crashing and the front row is good all i need is a good start now
4540248 its always fun to have a dry race but for me the wet will be ok too im looking forward to it
4540249 i have raced here twice before in the european championship and i really like the track i like the way it goes up and down hill the fast corners for me the race can be wet or dry i dont mind
4540250 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4540251 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4540252 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4540253 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4540254 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4540255 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4540256 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4540257 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4540258 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4540259 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4540260 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4540261 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4540262 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4540263 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4540264 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4540265 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4540266 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4540267 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4540268 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4540269 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working
4540270 for something like that to happen everybodys head has to be on the same continent
4540271 these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus were getting on great but we want to keep that chemistry and not get burned out we dont want to be doing it just for the money because it can turn into a chore thats what happened the first time it seemed like work and it wasnt fun anymore so i figured f this ill go get a job if youre doing something just for the money i think having a job is a bit more honest than playing in a band just for the money
4540272 its like everything just merges into one nowadays everythings sounding the same the problem with the modern metal scene is people are too busy copying bands wholesale and not actually taking an influence and doing something new with it i dont think its laziness i think it just comes down to imagination and intelligence
4540273 ozzy did it and even zakk wyldes done it playing with black label and ozzy
4540274 other people have done it but as far as vocally its just me and ozzy its good company to be in hes the dude that basically created this niche i think it would be pretty grueling to do it for a full tour
4540275 christian bale attended a london police station on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that has been made against him to the police by his mother and sister
4540276 mr bale who denies the allegation co operated throughout gave his account in full of the events in question and has left the station without any charge being made against him by the police
4540277 im excited to have paul and lynden join our gopher coaching staff
4540278 this is a great step in pauls career and in his progression as a collegiate coach in lynden we welcome one of our own one of the best throwers in gopher history home im looking forward to getting down to business and working with these talented coaches toward the common goal of continuing the tradition of excellence that is gopher mens track amp field
4540279 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of
4540280 painstakingly created his public persona to be that of a major drug dealer and gangster but is in reality a former correctional officer
4540281 ive been hearing things about me on your web site we gonna make a story we going to see each other we going to talk where are you
4540282 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part

4540289 i have a couple of daytime photos to share in confirming we are not alone both were taken in scarborough ontario on two different dates on april 9 2008 at 3 16pm est at work i noticed something strange moving across the sky from west
4540290 i sent an urgent request to the russian president through official channels to start negotiations to regulate our relations during military actions like those seen at the start of august
4540291 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
4540292 foi coisa de padroeira mesmo num dia comum seria trag dia

4540332 is this all i paid for my finished video i would have paid you double
4540333 the single most important thing you can do in businesses is be yourself
4540334 respectful of how much weve done to bring new audiences into the market
4540335 i think his view was that warner music should be compensated the way they might for a performance on itunes but this is an entirely different business that is very technically complex were going to favour those publishers that recognise and appreciate how much we can add value to their artists
4540336 were introducing a whole new group of artists to new audiences that is resulting in their itunes downloads being exponentially higher than they would otherwise be as well as new album sales and new merchandising opportunities
4540337 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
4540338 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
4540339 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4540340 id love to if i can find the right movie
4540341 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4540342 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4540343 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4540344 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4540345 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4540346 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4540347 i heard from school boards and school administrators in my district that the shortage of special education teachers is a severe challenge i promised to do what i can to relieve this shortage when we have people interested in doing this important work we shouldnt put unnecessary impediments in their way this will help families of special ed students by bringing more special ed teachers into the classroom to work with their children
4540348 it is in californias best interests to award contracts that benefit and build small business in our state the small business community and i have significant concerns that the state is not doing all it should to work with small business i am going to continue looking into these contracts until i am sure that small businesses and veterans are being treated fairly and that taxpayers are getting a fair deal for their money
4540349 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4540350 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4540351 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4540352 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4540353 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4540354 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4540355 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4540356 hillary rodham clinton is a lesbian and muslims worship satan
4540357 he said more people pray every day than have sex
4540358 meditation could be restorative in the same way as sleep
4540359 in the bu llshit department a businessman cant hold a candle to a clergyman
4540360 civilized humans demonstrate the ability to short circuit these impulses
4540361 so if people pray more than they get laid does that mean that religion could be just as basic a human need
4540362 and this particular batch of stuff will become a part of a chain leading to more stuff
4540363 i unless i think the accident is evil am not injured and it is in my power not to think so
4540364 people dont have control over every thing that happens to them but people control their reaction and thinking
4540365 fortune or fate is going to send you a lot of things you do not like the stoics said the true character of a person was how we dealt with things about which he had no choice
4540366 alexander gives a treasure to a soldier and mule soldier puts treasure on mule but mule starts collapsing so soldier takes treasure on his back and carries it into camp
4540367 power and success both lead to a dangerous over confidence which leads the actor to overstep the bounds of law setting off a chain of cause amp effect that leads to ruin
4540368 leave me alone dont get me mixed up with those guys
4540369 in january july 2008 340 cases of israelis both right and left wing disturbing the peace were opened compared to 313 cases in the parallel period last year
4540370 this was a meeting one of many held by the precinct with other entities with which police are in routine contact such as the idf so we have no intention of commenting on things said in internal discussions
4540371 the idf performs its role in cooperation with the police and shin bet
4540372 five or six nasty squabbles is not that much over 19 years
4540373 i could never never pay you back for these 19 years
4540374 it makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap
4540375 recently for the first time in my experience as a family court judge the name of a child described in text language has emerged
4540376 if dhl if something happens its going to be like a ghost town
4540377 i thought i was doing a good job providing for my family
4540378 its tough times when its a foreign entity coming in and sucker punching us thats how this felt
4540379 in washington john mccain helped pave the way for foreign owned dhl to take over an american shipping company
4540380 mccains campaign manager was lead lobbyist for the deal now thousands of ohio jobs at risk
4540381 with her unique background and experience shell be a natural at growing industry support for the project and connecting interested parties to our community
4540382 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst
4540383 our task is to assist the division in assuring that child support payments fully reflect the cost of raising a child in new hampshire
4540384 cooperative extension is a perfect fit for this project because we have a friendly and unbiased presence in every new hampshire county we know how to use solid research to inform policy and we are able to take advantage the extensive resources of unh to insure that solid information backs any recommendations we might make
4540385 this is evident in our team dr kalinowski is a proven researcher and exemplary educator in the child policy field and dr baughman is a proven economist who was named the universitys outstanding assistant professor for 2008
4540386 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4540387 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4540388 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4540389 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4540390 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4540391 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4540392 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men

4540398 during the past 15 years as poverty has eased in central cities rates of low income children in urban and rural areas has been converging
4540399 this implies that rural areas have been less responsive to changes that have benefited low income families in central cities reaffirming the unique policy needs of children in these two distinct areas
4540400 we look at children specifically because they are the most vulnerable population and they live at higher rates of poverty and low income than the general population
4540401 these numbers are also an indication of where these children might be in 20 years as there are strong ties between childhood poverty and economic challenges in adulthood
4540402 one explanation for the persistence of low income is that many low income full time working parents are employed in low wage service occupations or in occupations sensitive to seasonal cycles
4540403 mental or moral strength to venture persevere and withstand danger fear or difficulty
4540404 ever since i started on your herbal supplement sharon says sex is so much more pleasurable for her and she comes much more easily

4540421 in addition to the reasons you outlined in your newsletter today economics pressures demographics student loan crisis it is also worth mentioning that recent restrictions on home equity loans have impacted families ability to access non federal financing in response to these conditions more and more students are applying for aid to see if they are eligible for funding through our recently expanded financial aid initiative which provides support to families with incomes up to and in some extenuating circumstances beyond 180k

4540470 in our pursuit to completely reinvent the auto industry we are going to make one hell of a run at making the world a better place can we give you a little hint well our lawyers have given us specific guidelines in which we must not deviate from off the record it could be the first unlimited mileage electric car this said car might have a revolutionary self regenerating battery system this car would have some of the sexiest curves and doesnt resemble any electric car you have ever seen oh and best of all what would you say if you could buy this car for under 25 000

4540475 when you do that the mandate of the people is undermined
4540476 they were there as shepherds to help people those who were captured and those doing the capturing were members of the church
4540477 the church has no business in supporting a political party the methodist church refused to participate in the charter process
4540478 reverend manasa lasaro supported the 1987 and 2000 coup he should not be allowed to lead the methodist church administration again and there are many enlightened methodists who are against a repeat of his destructive leadership
4540479 the coup was illegal and so the charter is illegitimate this charter is an item on the agenda and will be discussed in the second week of the conference
4540480 we discussed it last year and the church was not supportive of it the position we will take is very clear
4540481 we will work with christian churches especially the methodist church two of us are part of the methodist think tank and the sdls stand on the charter is almost the same as the church
4540482 act scores for the class of 2008 have remained largely steady which is encouraging given that the number of test takers has expanded rapidly to include many more students than ever before we know that added rigor and accountability in our high schools will raise these scores even higher and better prepare students for college and the workforce while the percentage of students meeting act college readiness benchmarks remained steady in math reading and science it dropped in english this is unacceptable when 90 percent of the fastest growing jobs require at least some post secondary education
4540483 no child left behind has raised expectations for all students and started to close achievement gaps in todays competitive global economy it is imperative for us to continue to call on states to better align their standards with college and workforce expectations increase access to rigorous coursework and report a more accurate high school graduation rate so americas students can be armed with the critical skills they need to succeed in college and throughout their lives

4540507 concerns have been raised with the forum chairman of arrangements not facilitating fiji to attend that meeting and we well leave it at that
4540508 there is the 39th pacific forum in niue where post forum dialogue will be held at regional level and therell be bilateral meetings which will be one on one meetings between regional countries
4540509 that will be held in auckland that is the one we are concerned about and want to attend those meetings in auckland
4540510 we have followed proper channels and procedures of raising our concerns with the forum head
4540511 thats too early to say do not connect me to this what i want to say is fiji has followed proper procedures
4540512 we have followed the proper procedures for fiji to be able to provide full participation in the forum and its related meetings in this regard our concerns have been raised with the forum
4540513 this is niues forum not new zealands no forum events are being held in auckland
4540514 the suggestion that new zealand should somehow be obliged to permit an extended period by the fiji delegation in auckland for the purpose of holding bilateral meetings with post forum dialogue partners makes no sense and is clearly unnecessary
4540515 i cannot reveal those details but all i can say is that some have been released while the rest have been detained for further interviews
4540516 the allegations are very serious and that is why we are trying to give out as little information as we can about those who have been arrested she said
4540517 we are currently working on the finer details of the delegations travel to the forum meet and once these details are finalised a statement will be issued

4540619 the methodist church is not a political forum and if people abuse it there are laws and regulations i will enforce
4540620 as commissioner of police i will be monitoring it and looking into this seriously
4540621 everyone wants to enjoy the conference the singing the bazaar and the get together
4540622 that is the main aim of the methodist conference so let it be
4540623 we discussed issues of border control and how these resorts need to be careful on who they allow into waters surrounding their property
4540624 we should accept them and talk to them and say that life is much happier and better outside the walls
4540625 im a father and ive seen fathers get thrown into prison because they strike their wives and when they come back they are more frustrated with their wives
4540626 rather than giving them money teach them how to use money
4540627 wives children husband ex prisoners and victims have a role to play this is the time they should be together
4540628 we have churches and temples and located almost in every village but we have to encourage the pastors and pundits to stand up and talk to society where we have gone wrong and address the issue
4540629 i understand that the interim government wants the electoral reforms to be discussed but sir paul agreed with us to include other issues

4540633 you did not think of your grandparents when you committed the second offence however your sentence for robbery with violence was imposed nearly two years ago

4540637 the arts and sport is an avenue to build bridges
4540638 the arts provide a venue for people to listen to each other and therefore the potential to break stigmas
4540639 people often stay in the darkness because they cant see the light ahead of them if through the arts we can provide that light then we may save just a few young people who become brilliant artists and positive contributors to society
4540640 and for us out in the wider society well we wont walk into the darkness to see whats there without light so if art can provide that light then we meet each other half way learn about each other listen to each other and hopefully stigmas are broken

4540644 so you got to wait for the right one to fly on
4540645 this is my first time here but the flight disruption is nothing
4540646 and 150 out of the 600 travel agents were scheduled to fly from sydney on that flight
4540647 but obviously a delayed flight is not the way we would want to welcome these important visitors
4540648 we visited cathedral secondary school who also showed their support for the course
4540649 we had a meeting with management three weeks ago where we addressed our grievances with him
4540650 we didnt like the way he treated us employees of the resort who had worked there for many years building it into a five star level resort we saw that he was bringing in his cronies from where he worked in the west and placing them in positions to which we had been promoted to
4540651 we didnt like the way the meeting was going on so we walked out of it
4540652 the education fund was started eight years ago and is an agreement between the resort and landowners which involves the payment of school fees and fares of about 230 children from both naidi and vivili village
4540653 we met with namale resort management this yesterday afternoon and according to our investigations its the workers that are at fault
4540654 they have personal differences with management for instance there was one complaint that the manager was having an extra marital affair with one of the employees and that is none of our concern
4540655 additionally some of the employees have refused to pick up their termination letters after walking off their jobs others have returned their letters but of the 18 that initially walked off five have returned to work
4540656 it is an important network because the members interact as activists in sharing ideas about activities they can involve themselves in to create more awareness and work more to improve and protect the environment
4540657 the signs of success of this network are that students are going out to communities conducting awareness programs with the people
4540658 these students are the future of this country and if they can foster such attitudes toward the environment now then things look better for the environment in the future
4540659 that is self explanatory that really hasnt happened before because this is the first time secondary schools are coming together in the north to do something positive for the environment
4540660 they were displaying to the public from their acts of picking up rubbish that that was the proper way for a good citizen to act
4540661 really the place was littered with papers lunch wraps and it indicated a lack of concern for the environment once those papers get into the rivers and eventually the sea organisms would have been killed as a result
4540662 he did that so that it would seem his leaving cabinet was a party decision this was an attempt by him to mask his sacking
4540663 but the board decided by a majority that the party would not withdraw from being part of the running of the government the board decided if mr chaudhry has to go he would but not the party
4540664 we dont discuss internal party matters outside if there was any decision made it should come out by way of written press statements
4540665 thats what most if not all people know navosa of
4540666 cadet training will help you in the future it will help you wherever you go
4540667 we really needed this here we need it to help the children in their daily lives
4540668 we look to our travel industry friends in australia to help support us achieve this goal
4540669 you are our close neighbours flights are frequent and fiji continues to offer a range of options and great value for money in a clean environment
4540670 so the word you carry back is very important to fiji and air pacific
4540671 without it we would not survive and without the airline fijis tourism industry would struggle
4540672 my comment to the corporate houses and the general public is to have a heart and dig deep into their pockets and assist people who are in need when i first read the story about josaia i had tears in my eyes being a father of two healthy children i thought what if either of my children was in josaias shoes i didnt think twice and immediately decided to do my bit and assist
4540673 il nous a dit que le r dacteur en chef johan hufnagel ne serait pas licenci pour faute grave quil serait pay pendant le temps o il sera encore salari et quune n gociation serait entam e en vue dun accord financier

4540675 mis pied pour une raison que la direction a refus de communiquer aux salari s
4540676 i would not accept a renewed appointment from the unelected military government as the risk to the maintenance of rule of law was too great a price to pay
4540677 i decided to stay throughout 2007 as long as i had judicial effect
4540678 i also decided that i could not renew my warrant in 2008 if the military regime was still in power as to do so would be contrary to my oath of office
4540679 they have promulgated many laws to suit their revolutionary cause including on occasion legislating away the courts judgement
4540680 in so doing they undermine the rule of law by eroding confidence in the fairness predictability and transparency of justice
4540681 if i had intention to conceal the names i wouldnt have put the names down but would have paid out cash
4540682 i used to give them cash cheques and they cashed it
4540683 for lunch at noble house and they said it was a gift for helping repina get business
4540684 they cashed the cheque and from that i could see the two deputies were sharing the money i gave suli as you can see from the beginning it was only given to suli but in this incident all three were present when i gave the cheque to suli and he said it was a christmas present for all of them
4540685 from the beginning they seemed reserved about the money i gave suli but after we had lunch i could see them sharing the money
4540686 when i gave sakiusa the cheque he was going on leave to kadavu for christmas i told him if i was going down six feet you maff fellows will dig my body and ask for kerekere
4540687 he asked me if i was angry but i said no i was joking because everybody was asking kerekere all the time
4540688 an undercover officer boarded the flight and upon arriving at matei waited around to see the identity of the person who would pick up the parcel
4540689 not long after a 45 year old woman came to claim the parcel and police arrested her on the spot
4540690 the parcel contained 121 sachets of dried leaves believed to be marijuana 20 cash stashed in a yellow plastic file and two lecture pads
4540691 the value of the dried leaves is estimated at about 4 000
4540692 we are aware of the modes of deliveries being used last month drugs were sent to the island through courier and when that was caught out the delivery mode has switched
4540693 we are warning drug dealers that we are aware of how their send drugs to vanua levu or vice versa and we are on to them it is only a matter of time

4540698 knowingly scheduling a school board election on one of the most holy days in all of judaism is an insult to new jerseyans everywhere who value the diversity of our state
4540699 i am proud to stand with a coalition of legislators and religious and civic leaders in seeking a new date for this election hopefully through our collective efforts this will be the first and last time such a conflict will ever arise
4540700 anything you say can and will be used against you

4540718 what impact have your friends had on you lately this might sound like a strange question but your friends have influenced you for better or for worse more than you think does it really matter which friends you select after all shouldnt a christian be willing to have anyone around as a friend some argue that christians should invite everyone into their circle of friends since jesus christ was inclusive during his earthly ministry this belief seems appealing on its surface but there is more to the issue than meets the eye

4540720 it is a most bizarre and painful situation to be living away from my wife and family to not be living in my own home to not be going to work at my own job to not be in the presence of my co workers and community
4540721 to make the necessary applications so that i may return to canada
4540722 we are a family and families belong together not apart
4540723 theres not a whole lot of options left for these guys
4540724 there are clearly political considerations here the law doesnt offer protection to these guys it will take a discretionary political decision to save them
4540725 every solider who has refused to fight in iraq hasnt contributed to killing innocent people
4540726 its a terrible thing that the government of canada doesnt listen to the parliament of canada or the many people who support war resisters in canada
4540727 this sends a chilling message to those going through the same process
4540728 its creating a wave of stress among everybody if jeremy hinzman who has a wife and kids can be kicked out what about the single guys who have been here for a shorter period of time

4540738 my intention is to steal a lot of your lines
4540739 w hile this is hardly the first time a losing candidates name will be placed in nomination mo udall persuaded jimmy carter to allow it in 1976 the duration and intensity of the obama clinton nominating fight created wounds that have yet to heal among some democratic activists many backers of mrs clinton have been vigorously pushing for her candidacy to be validated through a roll call vote
4540740 this is a united convention this is a united party
4540741 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4540742 i dont think barack obama is qualified to be president of the united states they continue to call us racist sour old women sore losers this is all very insulting and its very sexist and completely uncalled for
4540743 weve been here nearly five years we have lots of friends and family
4540744 but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we go
4540745 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives

4540754 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
4540755 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
4540756 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
4540757 what is the condition of my childs heart whats the condition of my heart how can i model christ to them how can i encourage them to become more like jesus
4540758 its the same as my first album thug motivation 101 jeezy told

4540760 i wouldnt say that i was capitalizing off of it
4540761 you wanna know who is capitalizing off of it you gotta go talk to bush hes at the basketball games over in china gas is like 9 almost it seems like but hes enjoying himself while the rest of us are suffering
4540762 i got family members aunts uncles and friends that still live their life
4540763 you going through trials and trills but you cant save everybody so it definitely affects me when i get the phone calls and somebodys getting put out of their house somebody doesnt have a ride to work somebody cant pay their bills and there aint really a lot of opportunity out there for you
4540764 a murder is senseless when it is unnecessary to allow the defendant to complete his objective

4540767 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4540768 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4540769 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4540770 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4540771 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4540772 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4540773 i was singing it and a chill just came over me and i knew it was him
4540774 i get through because i know hes in a better place now
4540775 not only have they rebelled against the status quo by ripping out their gas guzzling engines and replacing them with zero emission electric motors they say just about anyone can do it

4540777 barack may know the language or mccain may know the language but do they share my worldview
4540778 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary

4540784 nero isnt necessarily a romulan its all part of the plot
4540785 there are certain things that as kids growing up whether its star trek or other shows at the time all you got to do is really just hear their voice and your heart warms
4540786 spend more time talking about issues that matter to evangelical voters
4540787 insisting that the weekend prayer and fasting event should not be seen as political
4540788 although weve got to be engaged we have to realize that ultimately we need gods direction and hand upon this country that changing a political party or changing a candidate is not going to make the ultimate difference
4540789 the ultimate difference is going to come when this nation puts in proper place its allegiance to god almighty and to jesus christ so this is a focused call upon christians to pray to fast to seek god on behalf of the nation this weekend
4540790 we are in danger of losing this whole country to the secularism of europe
4540791 the issue of abortion will not be a secondary issue in these elections and that god will drive it like a wedge into the campaign
4540792 people see warren holding hands with obama at warrens church and they think he is a christian man but when a candidate votes 100 percent for abortion according to planned parenthood and naral then that mans christianity does not line up with the christian truth upheld by the masses of true believers in america
4540793 extended interview in which he talked about how his faith was tested during his years as a prisoner of war from 1967 to 1973 said god must have had a plan for him to have kept him alive and reminisced about his appointment as informal chaplain to his cellmates
4540794 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4540795 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4540796 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4540797 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4540798 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4540799 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4540800 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4540801 this is something that weve all been looking forward to since the day that we first spoke with ryan and wife krissie about coming over here and joining the team
4540802 the addition of ryan coming on board now i think is going to make that list even grow larger
4540803 i think a lot of tony from a personnel standpoint as well as a driving standpoint and ive seen his success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done in other venues and i look forward to the opportunity
4540804 we know the owner alexandre gaydamak cant keep funding it its not a bottomless pit so in the end we had to accept the offer for pedro
4540805 theres no money left for signings now but we have spent good money
4540806 the owner has backed me and i cant fault what he has done there are still great players here
4540807 we may have to sell another one to raise the money to buy but if another one goes thats another loan i need
4540808 we are short of three players that is what we need to be a squad who can compete on the domestic front and try to have a run in europe
4540809 i have to balance the books though i had great offers for one or two other players but they didnt want to move

4540816 we are very sorry to hear that a customer is unhappy with one of our high school musical products and apologise for any offence caused
4540817 the knickers in question were designed using our high school musical 2 artwork which uses the creative theme of a swimming pool as this is a key part of the films storyline
4540818 unfortunately a genuine oversight was made and the text on this product was used outside the context of the swimming pool
4540819 this product will not be part of any forthcoming collections

4540826 when the network crashes you will be raped and made subject to men
4540827 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4540828 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4540829 all our efforts here in china are spent on learning from these wonderful beijing games so that we can enhance our offer for the olympic movement
4540830 at sochi 2014 our focus is to deliver an excellent and innovative games that will inspire the world we are on track to achive this
4540831 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
4540832 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
4540833 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
4540834 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up
4540835 were a very close family but we have been destroyed by this
4540836 why did they take him away thats what we want to know did they have to do that he had barely begun ive been on this earth longer than him

4540838 if those officers were unable to control the situation they should have asked for backup
4540839 the uk united kingdom has a proud record in human rights
4540840 we see the country reviews as a process based on collaboration and co operation and above all a commitment to improving human rights on the ground
4540841 the committee remains concerned that powers under the official secrets act 1989 have been exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters
4540842 it notes that disclosures of information are penalized even where they are not harmful to national security
4540843 should investigate allegations related to transit through its territory of rendition flights and establish an inspection system to ensure that its airports are not used for such purposes
4540844 while the committee is disturbed by the extension of the maximum period of detention without charge of terrorist suspects under the terrorism act 2006 from 14 days to 28 days it is even more disturbed by the proposed extension of this maximum period of detention under the counterterrorism bill from 28 days to 42 days
4540845 we know that obesity per se is a risk factor for developing heart disease
4540846 but once you develop it is obesity more detrimental than not being overweight there have been different studies with results going both ways
4540847 with low dose statin therapy obesity was detrimental with more blockage what was unexpected was that with high doses of the statin obesity did not have much of an effect at all
4540848 they lower inflammation and people who are obese have greater inflammation there is a lot of evidence that inflammation in general is not good since a person who is obese has more of that going on statins tend to protect
4540849 what we can say is that if you have heart disease particularly if you had bypass surgery you should be on a good dose of a statin
4540850 if you are overweight or obese you really should take your statin and be aggressive about it
4540851 you get much more benefit than for someone who is thinner

4540859 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4540860 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4540861 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4540862 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4540863 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4540864 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
4540865 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
4540866 the uk united kingdom has a proud record in human rights
4540867 we see the country reviews as a process based on collaboration and co operation and above all a commitment to improving human rights on the ground
4540868 the committee remains concerned that powers under the official secrets act 1989 have been exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters
4540869 it notes that disclosures of information are penalized even where they are not harmful to national security
4540870 should investigate allegations related to transit through its territory of rendition flights and establish an inspection system to ensure that its airports are not used for such purposes
4540871 while the committee is disturbed by the extension of the maximum period of detention without charge of terrorist suspects under the terrorism act 2006 from 14 days to 28 days it is even more disturbed by the proposed extension of this maximum period of detention under the counterterrorism bill from 28 days to 42 days
4540872 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4540873 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4540874 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4540875 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4540876 i believe there is now too much pressure in the climbing world for ever more daring and dangerous feats
4540877 the nick estcourt award was set up to honour nick estcourt who died in an avalanche on k2 and it was this very award that gave ben the opportunity to go out to pakistan
4540878 it is tragic that ben has met his fate in the same way
4540879 i would ask all climbers out there to remember ben cheek and the men who were killed on k2
4540880 before attempting anything like what they did please stop to think
4540881 an avalanche could take your life too and leave your family shattered forever
4540882 i cant believe that my brother will never come home again

4540888 when it comes to the airlines the odds are good that the goods are odd
4540889 this once again shows the airlines cannot be held accountable for even the most basic of security measures and further proves the need for congress and the department of transportation to step in and enforce existing laws which they have clearly been avoiding due to unearned sympathy for the airlines lobbying dollars poured into our congress to plead with them once again not to pass meaningful passengers rights standards and thats just unacceptable when it comes to the airlines and congress the odds are good that the goods are odd
4540890 cracks in the fuselage on southwest incorrect wiring on american airlines no adequate drug and alcohol testing deliberately neglecting safety issues that would jeopardize the lives of millions of people the airlines cannot be trusted to uphold the most basic of safety standards

4540901 if you have a civil marriage polygamy is forbidden to you if you have a religious marriage only polygamy is permitted to you consequently if you conduct a second third or fourth religious marriage according to shariah you are not violating italian law as italian law forbids polygamy in civil marriages only

4540907 it was necessary that she who had preserved her virginity inviolate in childbirth should also have her body kept free from all corruption after death it was necessary that she who had carried her creator as a child on her breast should dwell in the tabernacles of god it was necessary that the bride espoused by the father should make her home in the bridal chambers of heaven it was necessary that she who had gazed on her crucified son and been pierced in the heart by the sword of sorrow which she had escaped in giving him birth should contemplate him seated with the father it was necessary that the mother of god should share the possessions of her son and be venerated by every creature as the mother and handmaid of god

4540909 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4540910 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4540911 i get sharper and sharper with each race i do a little bit more confident about exactly what im doing at certain points in the race how to build the race properly

4540914 after this week with all phelps has done you dont want to be the guy standing in the way of that
4540915 people point at me but cavic is looking real good and a lot of other guys are looking really good
4540916 its going to be a tight race all across the board
4540917 for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50
4540918 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4540919 i never thought i would see this type of swimming in my life

4540954 deer drive is an entirely different animal when it comes to hunting games
4540955 most hunting games are slow moving simulations with frustrating controls deer drive is all about shooting all about pick up and play fun and being a more accurate marksman and better hunter than your friends
4540956 right now we have a crying need for beds almost every day
4540957 the last thing we want to do is have a lot of patients show up and we have to send them somewhere else
4540958 were seeing a lot of growth in the industry nationwide despite the political challenges
4540959 facilities that are run very well like galichia doctors want to practice there patients want to go there
4540960 its a verification of the concept that we can deliver first class care in a fine hotel type of setting and not sacrifice anything in terms of patient care and outcomes
4540961 when you only get 104 a week in unemployment and have to pay rent it doesnt leave much for medicine or groceries
4540962 i had been going to a doctor on gunbarrel road for about six years
4540963 then i was laid off my insurance was canceled and that meant no more seeing him
4540964 we try to provide the best quality care for all
4540965 weve been fortunate in being able to partner with local government and organizations and because of these resources we can provide quality care to everyone
4540966 growth is a combination of community education letting people know we are here and the rising cost of health care
4540967 there is more demand from low income families and those who are unemployed or have lost employer provided health insurance
4540968 i have high blood pressure am borderline diabetic have irritable bowel syndrome acid reflux arthritis you name it it seems ive had it
4540969 ive been really pleased with the service if i ever have insurance again ill still keep coming here
4540970 our patient numbers have doubled from 2 500 in 2000 to more than 5 000 patients including dental in 2007
4540971 we are a united way agency and work with the health departments and school systems in the area we service
4540972 the clinics provide quality medical care for those who can and those who cant have insurance
4540973 i grew up in rossville and it means a lot to see this tremendous need being met
4540974 this assures people that they will be seen by a doctor
4540975 centers like the ones in dade and walker counties give people a place to go that otherwise would go to the emergency room
4540976 emergency rooms are for emergency not primary or preventive care
4540977 the economy is making the demand for services increase and this is the only program like this in our district
4540978 before i had medicare and medicaid but when my ex husband died the government forced me to take his check which is enough more than mine to make me ineligible for medicaid as of sunday
4540979 all the government says is im sorry but how can i pay that much for medicine and still have money for food and rent i hope to get help here
4540980 everything is going up if you can get your medicines for a cheaper rate go for it

4541000 there are 47 million americans who have no health insurance
4541001 we need a universal plan to get all of them some coverage maybe everyone wont be able to get a heart transplant but they need some health coverage
4541002 give some health coverage to all people if some want a cadillac plan or a mercedes that would be for the botox and enhancement procedures then they can pay for that
4541003 people without health care coverage are going there for rudimentary treatments they are sick but they dont have coverage and need treatment
4541004 or workmans compensation or social security or medicare or the 40 hour work week they were all developed by the labor movement and the democratic party
4541005 special interest groups have divided us we have to stay strong and work to make the middle class strong again
4541006 we have to get everyone to the table the health care delivery system the insurance industry the pharmaceutical companies and the medical manufacturers and work together to control costs
4541007 what will it take for people to rise up and fight for what is right
4541008 it took the price of a gallon of gas to get to 4 before people adjusted their lifestyles and now the price is coming down
4541009 the purpose of this is to create a facility that can take care of our sickest patients both our local patients and patients transported to carle
4541010 peoples access to these facilities is based on whether they have access to carle clinic association physicians
4541011 right now there are a lot of people who do not have access to carle clinic because of the clinics policies especially with respect to people who are uninsured or who have medical debt
4541012 the dogs are all purebred and recognized by the akc
4541013 if someone is looking to buy a dog they can see 135 different breeds and talk to people who own them and see what their temperament is like
4541014 people say they are inspired to train their dog at home or look for a training school after watching it
4541015 with time training and consistency you can get a lot more out of your dog
4541016 verbal praise and something tasty to eat motivates a dog and builds a bond between the dog and its owner
4541017 it really depends on what their lifestyle is like and the space they have
4541018 for large dogs like great danes it is an inappropriate choice for someone that has a small apartment
4541019 she is the best athlete in the world so i dont feel a pity being overtaken by her
4541020 it was the right place to break the world record and i had hoped i would but it was not so next year i am sure ill do it
4541021 the footsteps of derartu tulu the 2 000 winner had to repeat themselves
4541022 omagh 98 will always be remembered for the horrific loss of innocent life and the terrible suffering caused to so many
4541023 as we continue to build a peaceful and a better future the omagh bombing remains an indelible stain on our history that will never be forgotten
4541024 our thoughts and prayers are with those who were killed and injured and all of those who still grieve for their loss and who continue to search for justice
4541025 i like to dress up as an elderly woman and pelt people with broccoli especially at big posh hotels i love it when they say stop chucking those bloody spears at me
4541026 they even gave me some extraterrestrial prophecies as a sign of their superiority
4541027 predicting that one day one of their very own would become president of the united states
4541028 of course they also said he would first need to detox before convincing texan voters hed make a good governor
4541029 after that the way would be clear for a tight fought run to the white house
4541030 and oh they said earthlings would recognise him when a rare extraterrestrial allegry to pretzels outed some of his toxicity issues heh
4541031 isso n o vai acontecer se voc estiver indo para isso voc vai se decepcionar
4541032 ridership is up 52 percent across the board compared to this time last year
4541033 well over 90 percent of the trips on the adirondack route were work related
4541034 a lack of personal vehicles high fuel and maintenance costs and seasonally treacherous driving conditions have traditionally prevented many employees from being able to retain long term distant employment in franklin county
4541035 clearly this new route has already proven itself to be more beneficial and popular than was foreseen in the planning stages
4541036 shes unique shes afflicted with crippling depression the elephant sanctuary is the right choice
4541037 why would we want her last years to be in a drive through zoo in mexico when she could have 300 acres in the lush tennessee countryside
4541038 if we stripped everything away and say what is in the best interest of jenny the sanctuary would win hands down
4541039 but then you have to add in all the politics
4541040 i like keeping these elephants within the a z a where they meet our standards
4541041 space is just a catchphrase its what you do with that space
4541042 you just never know whats going to happen to them down in mexico
4541043 chuck and jamie made it abundantly clear that they were not going to support the project
4541044 the municipal authority board was told to stop all activity on the project unless they wanted to proceed at their own risk
4541045 if you would have heard their reasons last night i felt like i was in junior high
4541046 theyre ridiculous and self absorbed its time to get them off that board
4541047 make yourselves clear and known that you want these people out of those seats at that table before our supervisors would be willing to put our money on the line to pay back their debt
4541048 please knock on your neighbors doors everybody tell them you have to let them know that you dont want them anymore
4541049 the only way they can be removed is if they commit whats known as an infamous crime
4541050 the pennvest loan will not be approved unless the township supervisors endorse the project and guarantee the financial responsibility that goes with the project
4541051 its healthier for our citizens and it puts pasco in a progressive mode as far as thinking that way
4541052 we are the first county in florida to put it in our comprehensive plan we were just before sarasota
4541053 that gives them more certainty about when theyll be able to speak
4541054 weve got an opportunity to have the first one this side of the mississippi
4541055 as a commissioner sitting on the tampa bay regional planning council ive been supportive of what theyre proposing while at the same time being respectful of staff as it goes through the permitting process
4541056 this will do a lot less ecological damage than if they just leave it there with the mining pits i think it will be huge they have something where they could actually attract people to come and there is a county park on the side of it
4541057 i think we have a better chance to recruit smaller businesses
4541058 we dont have a large port or a large airport like tampa does were not going to be a tier i were going to be a tier ii county
4541059 i thought it was the right move and i still believe that
4541060 as a county commissioner im going to be concerned about the health and welfare but careful not to take a position before it comes before me
4541061 i think the countys been very wise in how they set the numbers up the reason weve done so well to decrease our millage tax rate is because of our impact fees we need to make sure the costs are accurate everything we do needs to be justified
4541062 im not saying theres not more room for improvement if the state legislature is going to tell us youve got to find a way to make that happen
4541063 at current rates the city is not even covering the debt service and operational costs of its wastewater system much less making required repairs and improvements
4541064 if you got to pay it you got to pay it
4541065 im sure they think the small percentage is insignificant but look at the long term the elderly arent getting a 3 percent or 4 percent raise each year
4541066 plans constantly change and theres so many variables at stake
4541067 this does a very good job at cutting through the price variable price isnt the only factor but its an important one
4541068 what were saying is there are 200 dynamic plans and features theres no way a human can look at all those scenarios and come up with the right plan
4541069 la ley es muy clara en que cuando se pasa de una licitaci n revocada a un sistema de contrataci n abreviada el objeto debe ser el mismo el criterio que se tuvo en cuenta por la anterior mesa directiva es que al tratarse de las mismas comisiones y el mismo dise o no se variaba el objeto en mi opini n si se cambia
4541070 pudimos tomar esta determinaci n porque no ha nada que se haya contratado y que no sea compatible con lo que se piensa contratar adem s as la c mara no pierde ni un peso ni tiene ning n inconveniente
4541071 aplaudo que el ministro santos se interese por la seguridad
4541072 he works so hard and then right at the moment of truth it goes away
4541073 assegurar o direito da mulher e combater viol ncia contra ela uma quest o de relev ncia social
4541074 at first due to having friends with an incredibly imaginative habit of pranks i refused to believe it
4541075 bout as long as weve known you jack my mum gave it to me
4541076 this will represent 1 5 million worth of business that we will no longer have to pay a fee
4541077 we are also negotiating on a building to move our gas shop to in belmont that should take another 1 million out of the fee
4541078 eventually we will find enough space in belmont to move everything back and use this building for nothing but warehousing
4541079 then our business license will be almost nothing and the number of people we employ will reduce from 150 to 10
4541080 we have quite a challenge ahead of us weve had some other fees increased that have impacted our bottom line and this business license fee hits gross revenues the gross sales before anything else is taken off
4541081 if times are good you get more revenue and everything is fine and you can absorb it if times are bad it does affect us right out of the gate and makes it hard to offset it
4541082 the way to increase our tax base is to attract new business
4541083 lets use it as a tool to attract businesses to york
4541084 its really important that everyone understand that downtown businesses are struggling
4541085 so taking more money off of our gross sales not net sales is a concern for everyone
4541086 id rather it not be 70 cents to 1 but todays the day im sorry
4541087 the city is at a point now where we need revenue
4541088 i just dont think there is any purpose to do airport expansion right now from a business perspective it does not bring any additional income instead it will cause higher debt service on a 1 billion to 2 billion project
4541089 the best thing we can do is manage our affairs properly and keep our taxes and fees low people are having a hard time paying their bills and it is vital that the county commission maintain essential services but reduce the budget as much as possible
4541090 traffic in south florida is as bad as any place in the country you want to get as many cars off the road as possible because one of peoples pet peeves is the ability to get around of all the times we need mass transit it is now
4541091 theyve already voted on it my feeling is how do we move forward and how do we impact the lives of the people who live around the airport now
4541092 taxes are everybodys issue im a taxpayer and our taxes have gone up way too far and too fast i want to focus on public safety public health and public welfare our economy is a global problem but we have really got to streamline and deal with the bottom line of where we take broward county and how we do more with less
4541093 we grew too fast without the necessary infrastructure im not a big proponent of mass transit but i have to be realistic and know we have a lot of people that we have to move around and find new ways to do that i dont think were looking at expansion how would we pay for that there will be some tough decisions facing this county based on past performances
4541094 we need international travelers coming here and if this expansion had taken place when planned wed be better off today the city of fort lauderdale has wanted this expansion for 14 years and has seen it as a necessity the airport and seaport are the economic engines for our economy and we need to expand them both for the good of the many the airport must be expanded but there also must be mitigation for those who are impacted
4541095 their budget situation could be much better if they had dealt with it better earlier we have incorporated much of the unincorporated pockets of broward county but a reduction of their staffing was not done
4541096 you need to focus on the urban core where you already have ridership there should be lane closures on major roads during peak hours for buses close the right lane of broward boulevard from 441 to at least andrews from 7 to 9 each morning and use it as a hov lane you create an opportunity for a transit system that motivates people to use it
4541097 i just dont know where we are going to get the money and it will lower the quality of life in certain areas my opponent wants to draw the line in the sand and not budge even when some of his colleagues on the county commission said they didnt like the long runway and said lets explore our options he dug in his feet and that probably eliminated the chance of a more reasonable expansion plan
4541098 they really are just nickeling and diming line items in the budget and it will be tough to get to 80 million in savings by doing that they need to look at what departments overlap with the state of florida and close those departments that is a duplication of service you are paying taxes to the state and the county to do the same thing and that doesnt make sense
4541099 everyone says we need to improve mass transit but every plan is controversial and every one costs money the one idea that would cost the least money is synchronizing traffic lights that would do the single largest thing to reduce traffic congestion
4541100 people have been ferociously lobbying for ages the only difference is that now it has come out into the open
4541101 todays budget cut the basic rate of tax by 2p to 20p a move guaranteed to hit the headlines but i wasnt the only one not to notice that brown had also abolished the 10p tax rate which will hit people on lower incomes a strange move by a labour chancellor and one that confirms that budgets are about tricking as well as treating
4541102 i take huge exception to newspapers telling me how to vote
4541103 the intention wasnt to influence voters g2s editor told me
4541104 we wanted to reflect the fact that most readers would probably be quite alarmed by the idea of london having a tory mayor
4541105 it was supposed to be fun in a serious way
4541106 ach that floppy hair and that sodding bicycle has any man ever before managed to persuade such a huge number of people that he was such a decent chap on two such flimsy trivial irrelevant modish pieces of ephemera
4541107 boris as mayor unthinkable it just exposes democracy as a sham especially if people dont vote for ken hes the best thing in politics unthinkable
4541108 hes a rich man and he wont understand the problems that people face day to day

4541122 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4541123 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4541124 i get sharper and sharper with each race i do a little bit more confident about exactly what im doing at certain points in the race how to build the race properly
4541125 i dont think we were going to leave china if anyone got us dqed
4541126 its such a historic event on the line with this relay this relay might be what it all comes down to for the eight golds you dont want to be the one who screws that up

4541128 people point at me but cavic is looking real good and a lot of other guys are looking really good
4541129 its going to be a tight race all across the board
4541130 for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50
4541131 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4541132 i never thought i would see this type of swimming in my life
4541133 this is absolutely going to be something for the ages a hundred years from now people will probably remember this olympics and what team usa did and especially what michael did
4541134 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4541135 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4541136 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready
4541137 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4541138 voting is the heart of the democratic process and we are pursuing a recount as that is the fairest way possible to make sure the peoples voice through the election is most accurately heard
4541139 i have received encouragement to pursue the recount from an overwhelming number of democratic primary voters at this stage the recount becomes a legal procedure
4541140 lathrop amp gage has handled election recounts like this many times before
4541141 as candidates are able to request a recount whenever their losing margin is less than 1 percentage point and given the slim margin separating the candidates at the top we feel it is in the best interest of the state and of all those who voted to make sure there is no error in tabulating the final results and that the votes of all citizens are counted for this important race
4541142 representative donnelly and her supporters ran a tremendous race it is within her right to verify the elections results we remain confident that our campaign is on the path to victory in november and i will continue to travel to every corner of missouri to talk about my law enforcement experience and the issues that matter most to working families

4541161 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4541162 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4541163 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life

4541171 i always felt that united would do it last year but i fancy chelsea this time
4541172 theres no african cup of nations in january theyve got a new manager theyve bought one or two players and for all the ups and downs last year they still nearly nicked it
4541173 if united get a top striker in then theyve got a chance
4541174 but my gut feeling this year would still be chelsea
4541175 robbie and fernando torres will be a real handful playing together
4541176 i think liverpool will go close this season and im sure theyd like to think theyd go closer than the last few years

4541244 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4541245 all our efforts here in china are spent on learning from these wonderful beijing games so that we can enhance our offer for the olympic movement

4541290 two campers see an encroaching and hungry bear heading their way
4541291 why are you putting on those shoes you cant outrun a bear
4541292 i dont have to outrun the bear i have to outrun
4541293 ive been in love for the same woman for 30 plus years warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
4541294 not answering the question hes buying time to give an appropriate innocent response they werent asking how great is your wife they were asking about the accuracy of the story
4541295 when a person is getting ready to tell a lie they repeat the question back because they need time to formulate an innocent response
4541296 its pretty clear that when john edwards is getting ready to tell a lie his affect is inappropriate
4541297 he smiles a lot during this interview when he shouldnt be smiling its almost like a nervous preparation to get his lie out
4541298 he believed he was being attacked he in fact was being attacked by individuals on the other side of the border
4541299 they were throwing large rocks boulders and in a couple of instances pieces of concrete block towards him
4541300 seven to 15 mexican nationals in a group many of them still armed with rocks
4541301 two of the suspects however remained and were still armed with rocks and directing their attention toward the border patrol agents
4541302 tournament style vote off day 6 nfl qbs up now a smith vs b cryole pick the winner
4541303 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4541304 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4541305 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4541306 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4541307 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4541308 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4541309 among my favourite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4541310 ununsurprisingly knowing my restlessness im now obsessed with something else entirely
4541311 and there you see the distinction between our feelings had he been in my place and i in his though i hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall i neve would have raised a hand against him you may look incredulous if you please i never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his the moment her regaurd ceased i would have torn his heart out and drank his blood but till then if you dont believe me you dont know me till then i would have died by inches before i touched a single hair of his head
4541312 the gem cannot be polished without friction nor man perfected without trials
4541313 well we have this idea plaster 2 kids and a bunch of their fat friends onto everything we can sell to kids aged 4 8 and call them musicians to provide a friendly rock n roll image to their parents so they can buy buy buy
4541314 brilliant this is the best idea youve had since hannah montana whats your name again
4541315 movie money inside to see this blockbuster piece of shit
4541316 naked brothers band i have no idea how to be green please guide me with your all powerful knowledge
4541317 well consumer to be green you have to be aware of the environment and watch an inconvenient truth like we did you will be green after that
4541318 everyone i am 6 foot 6 you all must be aware of this
4541319 check me out im green i do nothing for the environment i tell everyone else that they should do something
4541320 this is for you it is good for you and i have done this great thing for you
4541321 the irs realized that most employers arent following those rules
4541322 and that way the tax burden shifts to the employee and the university has no exposure because were giving the employee additional wages to go out and buy their own phone
4541323 this is what the 9 11 truth movement really believes
4541324 in the 17yrs he has worked there ive never seen such a great turn out and everyone having such a good time
4541325 for we are not as so many peddling the word of god but as of sincerity but as from god we speak in the sight of god in christ
4541326 but when you do a charitable deed do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
4541327 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
4541328 its ludicrous to think that the faculty member who was arrested was unaware that it was morally offensive to offer higher grades to several of his students if he could grope them
4541329 i dont believe there is a single faculty member who is unaware of the universitys sexual harassment policy the fact that harassment took place did not happen because of the lack of awareness of the universitys policies
4541330 thats it hes sick he must be close to his last days
4541331 thats it he must be diabetic hes gonna die soon
4541332 el culpable y responsable de la inseguridad que padece hoy el pueblo de irak
4541333 los m s de 160 mil soldados que se encuentran en el pa s iraqu son una amenaza para todo nuestra regi n y por lo tanto mientras sigan en la zona seguir n siendo un peligro constante
4541334 vemos con buenas expectativas este cambio en el pa s paraguayo
4541335 because hes the hero that gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now and so well hunt him because he can take it because hes not a hero hes a silent guardian a watchful protector a dark knight
4541336 goddam it i was thinking the exact same thing but i wouldnt have said it
4541337 but these primates are exactly what the war needs they cannot speak english so we dont have to hear them whining about how theyd like to have ceramic plates in their body armor theyre used to living in a zoo or a jungle so housing them will be easy and theyve got opposable thumbs on their hands and their feet think about it the average foot soldier only has two limbs that can fire weapons these buggers have four guns on their hands guns on their feet these guys are bristling death
4541338 hannibal used elephants to great success but this may be a tactic of a new order giving monkeys guns and grenades is radically different from using pachyderms to cross mountains
4541339 these primates are not bound by the geneva convention which only applies to humans plus they are ultra aggressive when we starve them for several days anyone that makes eye contact with these chimps is gonna get a bullet in the brain or any other place these monkeys can hit
4541340 i never realized how ruthless apes can be until i saw charlton heston being man handled by those dirty apes it was terrifying to watch how vicious they could be
4541341 i knew any ape that could handle a man like heston would be a great soldier in iraq i got on the horn immediately to try and find out what happened to the apes in that movie were they executed for their crimes against humanity no one seems to know where they went but im sure if we round up enough apes well get some of their descendants in the mix they come from good stock tough fighters kinda creep though apes talking like men and wearing man clothes but that may be what we need bloodthirsty smart apes that can speak perfect english this is going to be the turning point of the war
4541342 my god these are peaceful creatures not tools of war
4541343 they know nothing of war or killing or even how to load a gun and the us military wants to use them as pawns to attack other humans this is atrocious how will the apes be compensated in bananas what about access to health care on the battlefield the hot sand will burn their tender foot pads who knows how to treat an ape on the battlefield this plan is not sound
4541344 this plan rules once those apes touch down in iraq they will be killing machines no mercy just chimps enslaving the terrorists and parading them around in leg irons and neck chains this will be my greatest success apes in iraq is going to totally rock
4541345 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4541346 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4541347 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4541348 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4541349 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4541350 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4541351 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4541352 police are treating the death as unexplained at present and are hoping that the results of the post mortem forensic tests and other available evidence will enable them to focus the enquiry in a positive direction
4541353 i do not have any trust in this legal farce
4541354 i think he thinks this circus has gone on long enough
4541355 to proceed without al bahlul without mounting a defense destroys any possibility of any appearance of legitimacy and fairness
4541356 the other day you have rendered a verdict in salim hamdans case and now you can start my case
4541357 at the same time you are my enemy we dont really accept this kind of logic
4541358 basic morality with asceticism there are an additional three concepts
4541359 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others
4541360 theres a lot of comment being made that it looks fake or it looks like a suit
4541361 but these people wasnt there when i was sweating pulling this thing through the woods

4541363 god cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from himself because it is not there there is no such thing

4541366 if you havent already done so its important to get a diagnosis from your vet just to be sure that it is actually mites and to discuss using natural remedies before you do so many domestic creatures co exist with a low level of parasites but if they become stressed for whatever reason the parasite gets the upper hand so it would be worth giving some thought to your parakeets living situation in case you can pin point any issues such as bullying or perhaps a slight lack of space or interesting things to do in their cage which could be remedied by adding more perches nest boxes e t c many birds seem to appreciate a sand bath when they have irritated skin so you could also consider putting a shallow dish of chinchilla sand available from pet shops in their cage to mimic the dust bath they would naturally make for themselves in the wild mites can only live for a few days off the host bird but it is important to make sure you clean the area and throw away any nesting material when you treat and it is normal to treat all birds in a group once you have looked at the practical things you can consider which oils to work with birds are quite fragile and so are more suited to hydrolats also known as aromatic waters or essential oils in very low dose the easiest way to offer these is to put them on a saucer in a part of the cage or aviary where the birds do not always spend a lot of time or in the room if you allow them to fly free each day this way they have to make the effort to actually go and select the remedy add 3 5 drops of hydrolat to a shallow dish of water or 1 drop of essential oil to 10 ml of base oil and then pour 3 or 4 drops onto a dish and make sure that the oils are offered in a well ventilated area and preferably only left in with the birds for a couple of hours at a time you can consider oils such as juniper berry for its anti parasitic and skin cleansing action bergamot for its immune boosting properties and blue chamomile to soothe irritation and inflammation as a result of scratching and feather pecking if there is skin damage then they may also show interest in either rosehip or calendula base oils which can support skin regeneration and these can be offered in the same way the birds may just stay close and inhale or they may actually peck at the saucer or drink the water or oil i have also had really excellent results with persistent mite infestations in chickens by using a clay based powder put 1 tablespoon of white clay powder in a plastic bag and add 5 drops of neem oil and 1 drop each of cypress lavender and geranium shake well leave to infuse for an hour or so and then very gently apply a little of the powder under the wings around the root of the tail where the legs join the body and down the back of the neck and spine about a teaspoon in total per bird is sufficient repeated once a week until all signs of mites and eggs have gone it is important that you do this in a well ventilated area so that the aroma can gradually dissipate and that if the bird shows any sign of distress when it inhales the aroma do not continue with the application if the problem keeps occurring then it would be worth seeking a consultation from a recommended therapist who will be able to do a full assessment of your parakeets and come up with the oils that are most appropriate for them as individuals
4541367 nato could not defend poland fast enough if russia launched an attack
4541368 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4541369 today americans would be outraged if u n troops entered los angeles to restore order tomorrow they will be grateful this is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated that threatened our very existence it is then that all the peoples of the world will pledge with world leaders to deliver them from this evil the one thing that every man fears is the unknown when presented with this scenario individual rights will be willingly relinquished with the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government
4541370 there is no clear cut winner although russia and usa lead the pack in nuclear missile capable countries the us slbms can carry the largest number of mirved warheads which can increase its attack radius while russian icbms can carry more warheads and have more sophisticated mobile launch capabilities
4541371 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4541372 our soccer team won the gold medal in martial arts
4541373 china has had a weird year with a freak snowstorm the tibetan riots and an earthquake but the performance of our soccer team shows that some things never change
4541374 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
4541375 its so beyond an embarrassment that it almost seems like a comedy
4541376 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time
4541377 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4541378 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4541379 i travel from place to place never staying to long
4541380 i dont remeber it was so long ago that i last saw him
4541381 a very fruitful meeting barl had finally been able to make the concerned authorities understand the significance of ham operators in a country with frequent natural disasters like floods and cyclones
4541382 almost all the senior officials engineers and technical experts of the authorities
4541383 promote ham radio as a scientific hobby in the country
4541384 the department of defense would be required to grant journalists access to ceremonies honoring fallen military personnel under a bill introduced in the u s house of representatives
4541385 it must be aesthetic week around here i cant stop thinking about pictures and what defines them
4541386 this news does seem a bit crazy when you hear about it but once you read the details it actually sounds neat
4541387 the macro issues affecting emerging market investments are some of the same ones that are affecting emerged market investing decisions albeit with slightly different impact
4541388 how deep is the recession here how long is the recession here a short shallow recession would benefit a deep extended one would hurt
4541389 from a straight currency translation its a positive for them theyre generating costs in a depreciating currency and generating revenues in a positive currency
4541390 if there is a coupling and the world literally mirrors the us recession albeit with a lag of six to 12 months depending on where you are thats not a particularly positive outlook for emerging markets
4541391 if on the other hand us demand snaps back and china bounces back quickly then emerging markets could be ok
4541392 chinese taiwanese relations seem to be at an all time peak
4541393 jauh sebelumnya kami sudah berikan surat edaran yang mengatur masalah pencalegan
4541394 kalau cuma indikasi dan dia bisa mempertanggungjawabkan tidak apa apa
4541395 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4541396 with its actions in recent days the us has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century only the us can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4541397 are you going to take this chuck it just try
4541398 its nice to meet people from every town we go to and those people who sign up and decide they want to volunteer those are the same kids who maybe are starting an environmental club at their school theyre the motivated ones who decide to sign up and help with the greening efforts of the show
4541399 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett
4541400 he will always be a packer and hes very important to this organization
4541401 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4541402 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4541403 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4541404 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4541405 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4541406 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4541407 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4541408 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4541409 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4541410 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4541411 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4541412 if kirkuk remains stable iraq will become more stable if kirkuk blows up iraq might fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines
4541413 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4541414 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq
4541415 if you turn it toward division it could divide entire iraq if you turn it toward unity then iraq will be in cohesion
4541416 we have not been able to return half of the displaced kurdish people to kirkuk
4541417 they have changed the turkish name of the delibas mosque into dilbas in kurdish
4541418 i would have to say being a leader first stepping up taking care of the ball ball security is always important for us and putting some points on the board so we can get a win
4541419 we want to see troy play quarterback well and do the things that winning quarterbacks do move the team make good decisions operate the offense and avoid the costly mistake
4541420 we want our offense to be aggressive we never say dont turn the ball over its aggressive ball security
4541421 we want to score a lot of points and we want to secure the football its going to be the same thing with troy were going to be aggressive in everything we do offensively were not buttoning anything down ever its just not our mind set
4541422 i dont think about things just in context of myself its about the team all the time
4541423 im just going to be myself im going to step out there and try to be cool and calm and try to lead this team to a victory
4541424 some of them were a joke and the textbooks were poorly written
4541425 my religious courses never required much research and are taught by teachers who have their own beliefs
4541426 we have clear evidence of bias in the uc state system
4541427 society is increasingly devoid of the message and influence of god
4541428 these students are treated like second class citizens for their beliefs
4541429 the university welcomes students of all religious faiths and recognizes that a diversity of educational backgrounds among our students including religious education enriches the uc community and the academic experience
4541430 we know you are planning to assassinate leaders of the resistance but you do not frighten us
4541431 israel exported failed generals in order to train the georgian armed forces
4541432 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed
4541433 this was a preposterous lawsuit and we are pleased that it has been dropped
4541434 americans should be aware that such lawsuits may seem far fetched but they really are happening and foreign legal decisions are increasingly cited in american courts
4541435 does not allow as well that the parents may decide their children become members of a religious association
4541436 its unthinkable to ask the government to force the church to abandon one of its sacraments to appease a radical anti religious agenda yet thats what this activist group did
4541437 according to italian law the demand to remove a name from the register must be made by an individual with a personal interest rather than by a private association such as the uaar
4541438 also it was easy to demonstrate that the group had no legal leg on which to stand
4541439 all parents have the right to raise their children in their religious tradition which obviously includes participation in the historic rituals associated with that religion
4541440 i sill cant believe pitt took him back they have a perfect brew of shit at that school to open up a portal to hell
4541441 corporations are private entities and are allowed to censor you
4541442 we need to restrict some speech to keep people safe or to protect national security
4541443 the planet earth because we have the most beautiful planet

4541449 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4541450 television networks should be setting a higher standard of pronunciation and fulfilling their role of informing and educating the viewing public
4541451 mispronunciations are misinformation the casual attitude of the networks towards this matter is at best negligent and at worst bordering on disrespect for china and the chinese
4541452 two campers see an encroaching and hungry bear heading their way
4541453 why are you putting on those shoes you cant outrun a bear
4541454 i dont have to outrun the bear i have to outrun
4541455 there is plenty of passion surrounding the venezuela policy debate
4541456 deliberate on the part of the north american navy it is nothing but another link in the chain of provocations in which they are trying to involve our country
4541457 determined that the government of venezuela has failed demonstrably in meeting its obligations under international counter narcotics agreements and u s domestic counter narcotics requirements
4541458 guarantee venezuelas sovereignty which is now threatened by the united states
4541459 rescinded venezuelas eligibility to purchase most types of u s weapons and weapons systems closed venezuelas military acquisition office in florida arrested unauthorized venezuelan agents denied venezuela access to export import bank financing and overseas private insurance corporation coverage designated several venezuelan nationals under executive order 13224 and the narcotics kingpin act for its support provided to hezbollah and for trafficking illicit drugs
4541460 let them make that list and shove it in their pocket we shouldnt forget for an instant that were in a battle against north american imperialism
4541461 we need to understand the hunger for recognition and inclusion by populations marginalized from economic and political power procedural democracy is not a priority for many in this situation having greater control and participation in the forces that determine their daily lives is
4541462 aqu se cree que cualquier malcriado puede hacer lo que le da la gana
4541463 o remember your sheelah when far far away and be kind my dear pat to our poor dog tray
4541464 i think another important item to bring to the attention of the legislature is this proposed tax break how can government operate if it keeps giving away its revenue taxes are the dues we pay for roads schools and public health what if everyones check went into public health if politicians really want to help working families they could raise the minimum wage by a dollar which would give some families about 4 000 a year increase and increase tax revenue the extra tax revenue and spending from working families would create jobs now is the time to be innovative with work hours work weeks living wage and universal health care universal child care kindergarten and public transportation this is a time for bravery and creativity our economy has been mismanaged for too long by skewing policy towards the rich give some real breaks to the working people it cant be worse than corporate tax giveaways have been
4541465 como es posible q una menor le aya ganado a un atleta que tiene muchos a os de entrenamiento
4541466 first the company paid 20 000 to become a member of the national gay and lesbian chamber of commerce and to have a seat on the board of directors next mcdonalds refused a request to remain neutral in the culture war by choosing to promote the gay agenda then mcdonalds accused those opposing the gay agenda including same sex marriage of being motivated by hate
4541467 now we learn that mcdonalds sponsors training for homosexuals on how to promote their agenda among corporations from the inside out amp equal workplace advocates is a national organization devoted to the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community in the workplace one of its primary purposes is to train employees how to aggressively promote homosexuality within the company they work for all the way to the corporate boardroom
4541468 part of last years out amp equal summit in washington d c sponsored by mcdonalds was an organized march into congressional offices demanding same sex marriage laws be passed
4541469 after afa exposed it it was removed by the mcdonalds employee
4541470 mcdonalds says they stand by and support our people to live and work in a society free of discrimination and harassment
4541471 here is what they wont tell you mcdonalds helped sponsor the san francisco gay pride parade
4541472 it continues to amaze me that corporations like mcdonalds continue to publicly and financially support things that alienate their consumer base
4541473 shareholders as well as customers should be outraged at the blatant position this company has taken on this issue mcdonalds corporation has a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to continue to earn profits and expand their company by alienating such a large consumer base the christian community they are undoubtedly neglecting this responsibility
4541474 we have gotten good responses from some other christians about spreading the boycott picketing of mcdonalds elsewhere
4541475 america is tired of corporations and organizations twisting the free speech and actions of its citizens into hatred when we simply oppose the corporations or organizations involvement in areas where we dont want our money going
4541476 we love your fries but we will not compromise truth you have taken money that our family and millions of others have contributed to the success of the mcdonalds corp and chosen to use it for an agenda that defies the foundation of our nation the family as created by a man and woman
4541477 i will take my 10 great grand children to wendys burger king or some other place you are not the only game in town
4541478 this is not about hate mcdonalds but about good people opposed to a lifestyle we believe is immoral
4541479 i have been a mcdonalds customer since your burgers cost 15 cents since you have decided to advocate and support the destruction of traditional marriage and by extension the family i will no longer patronize your stores
4541480 i dont buy any more from you neither will my friends here in my nation uruguay
4541481 marriage between a man and a woman is the norm throughout the world
4541482 its a shame that mcdonalds would tarnish their family friendly image but the company has ramped up its support of the gay agenda and it leaves us no option but to call for a boycott
4541483 you absolutely have to do that right now and you dont need to give them more than a few days and if they dont do it you need to file chapter 9 because you have to stop the bleeding youre wasting millions of dollars every day and every week on nothing

4541885 to the contrary the russians have been provoking georgia all year theyve been supplying arms fuel and political support to the rebels in south ossetia and abkhazia who are trying to breakaway from georgia theyve shot down a georgian surveillance drone theyve flown fighter jets over georgia to scare tbilisi off of gravitating towards nato theyve encouraged the separatists to take violent actions and they finally pushed too far georgia pushed back seeking to crush the increasingly violent rebels russia then used georgias move as a pre text to launch a war theyve been preparing for all year and keep in mind this isnt about two tracts of land controlled by rebels this is all about russia not wanting georgia to become a nato member

4541931 i would like to congratulate the maoists for entering multi party competitive politics
4541932 we will stay in opposition and keep an eye on the maoists activities while they run the government we will oppose their actions if their activities incline towards autocracy

4541939 for the life of me i cannot understand why the geniuses in trenton insist on having homeowners file their application later in the year separate from the nj 1040 filing when the nj homestead rebate was the only rebate offered both tenants and homeowners would apply for it on a form hr 1040 now that there is once again only one property tax rebate why cant we go back to the hr 1040 filing process it would be much much more convenient and practical for taxpayers and tax preparers alike to have all new jersey taxpayers apply for the nj homestead rebate with the filing of the nj 1040 i know i would much rather take care of everything at the same time instead of having to deal with homeowner client inquires about the rebate 3 to 6 months after the end of the tax filing season i expect that it would be more convenient and practical for the nj division of taxation as well to have everything done in one filing the separate filing for homeowners especially affects senior citizen homeowners many of whom are confused by the process and i suspect as a result do not file for the rebate this defeats one of the major purposes of the rebate tax relief for senior citizens i have written to robert thompson and john tully asking them to explain the logic behind the separate applications if i receive a response i will post it here what are your thoughts on this issue there is no word on when the property tax reimbursement application packages ptr 1 and ptr 2 will be mailed out but the website indicates that the applications must be filed on or before june 1 2006 however as has been the case in the past i anticipate that this deadline will be extended several times actually there is no reason why this application cannot also be part of the nj 1040 filing
4541940 the property ownership records and assessed values of the properties are complied annually by each municipality and are not available to the division of taxation until sometime in march of the following year long after the tax season has begun therefore the rebate application cannot be included as part of the income tax return
4541941 i would much rather take care of everything at the same time instead of having to deal with homeowner client inquires about the rebate 3 to 6 months after the end of the tax filing season
4541942 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
4541943 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
4541944 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
4541945 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others
4541946 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
4541947 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force
4541948 the u s has long been involved in supporting freedom movements throughout this region that have been attempting to replace russian influence with u s corporate control the cia national endowment for democracy and freedom house includes zbigniew brzezinski former cia director james woolsey and obama foreign policy adviser anthony lake have been key funders and supporters of placing politicians in power throughout central asia that would play ball with our side none of this is about the good guys versus the bad guys it is power bloc politics big money is at stake b oth parties republican and democrat share a bi partisan history and agenda of advancing corporate interests in this part of the world obamas advisers just like mccains one of his top advisers was recently a lobbyist for the current government in georgia are thick in this stew
4541949 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance
4541950 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
4541951 we are looking for alternatives for our voters to give them access

4541977 heute vormittag war alles neu f r mich und ich musste das motorrad zuerst kennen lernen und mich ans fahren gew hnen sp ter hatte ich dann schon viel mehr gef hl weil wir noch nicht wissen ob es morgen regnet oder trocken bleibt haben wir in alle m glichen richtungen gearbeitet haben die balance ver ndert und eine menge reifen ausprobiert
4541978 das neue bike ist in mehreren bereichen eine verbesserung der motor ist kr ftiger und reagiert besser beim beschleunigen und im topspeed auch das gef hl f rs chassis ist besser also bin ich insgesamt mit der neuen maschine sehr zufrieden wir haben noch viel arbeit vor uns weil wir nur heute bisher daten sammeln konnten
4541979 abgesehen vom sturz bin ich mit meiner leistung zufrieden vor allem in der zweiten session am nachmittag hatten wir den reifen drauf der mir das beste gef hl vermittelt und ich konnte w hrend der gesamten session gute zeiten fahren nat rlich haben wir noch viel zu tun denn der asphalt ist ganz neu und wir m ssen weitere daten sammeln um uns weiter zu verbessern
4541980 es war ein toller tag und ich muss sagen dass shinya mit dem neuen motorrad sehr gut gestartet ist er ist sehr gl cklich damit dabei war es erst der erste tag mit dem bike er braucht nat rlich noch mehr zeit um sich mehr daran zu gew hnen er wird sich weiter verbessern denn es ist eindeutig das potenzial daf r da alex hat seine sache auch gut gemacht abgesehen vom sturz war er immer schnell und hat erneut sein gro es potenzial zeigen k nnen
4541981 our study shows that most people with stroke symptoms still do not get to the hospital in a timely manner
4541982 this precludes them from being considered for time dependent treatments that can reduce disability and death following a stroke
4541983 while patients that arrive to the hospital within 2 hours of symptom onset are more likely to receive a timely ct scan than those who do not
4541984 most do not this points to areas where stroke systems of care within hospitals can be improved

4541991 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4541992 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4541993 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4541994 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4541995 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4541996 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4541997 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4541998 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4541999 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4542000 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4542001 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4542002 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4542003 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4542004 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4542005 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4542006 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4542007 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4542008 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4542009 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4542010 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4542011 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4542012 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4542013 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4542014 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4542015 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4542016 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4542017 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4542018 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4542019 beyonces being double teamed to give in and get pregnant both her husband and her mother want to see her have a child beyonce is more focused than ever on her career and she doesnt want to have it slowed down by a baby
4542020 i have received a lot of communications from the public and the press asking for updates on the case so yesterday i phoned city of london police at wood street for an update
4542021 for a person intentionally and without lawful authority to intercept at any place in the united kingdom any communication in the course of its transmission
4542022 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4542023 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4542024 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4542025 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4542026 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4542027 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4542028 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4542029 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4542030 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4542031 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4542032 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4542033 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4542034 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4542035 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4542036 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4542037 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4542038 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4542039 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4542040 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4542041 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4542042 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4542043 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4542044 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4542045 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4542046 des n gociations se d roulent et beaucoup de gens ont int r t ce que cette question soit r gl e de mani re amicale sans aller jusqu la destitution du pr sident pervez musharraf

4542051 essaie juste de le mettre sous pression pour quil sen aille mais il ne le fera pas
4542052 wow are they actually making fun of themselves a little
4542053 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4542054 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4542055 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4542056 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4542057 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4542058 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4542059 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4542060 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4542061 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4542062 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4542063 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4542064 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4542065 you arent getting a lot of stuff are you because i dont want to be there long

4542074 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4542075 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4542076 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4542077 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4542078 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4542079 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite

4542083 i am so outraged by this blatant exploitation of the gay community that i yelled with my pocketbook canceled my membership and encouraged my friends to do the same
4542084 it should be known that jonathan crutchleys donation to mccain left the entire board in disbelief i am disappointed that we have lost some customers and i understand the anger it is too bad for the web site if we lose customers but please never refer to me as a republican i consider it an offense earlier today at the request of the board jonathan has stepped down as chairman
4542085 you live in a world turned upside down by humanitys rebelling sometimes things dont make sense when you dont let your daughter sara play near the street it doesnt make sense to her one day it will god loves with a love greater than you can know he doesnt want anyone separated from him but some will be one day that will make sense
4542086 man of hope false hope believes that it is okay to with hold medical care and allow that child living breathing human being to die
4542087 he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
4542088 its not just the west that doesnt know our history we ourselves have lost it recent events both pre and post revolutionary have been wiped out the documents have been burnt the witnesses killed so i have been working to reconstruct the truth all the truth about my own country
4542089 i am not afraid of death any more when i was young the early death of my father cast a shadow over me he died at the age of 27 and i was afraid to die before all my literary plans came true but between 30 and 40 years of age my attitude to death became quite calm and balanced i feel it is a natural but no means the final milestone of ones existence
4542090 when i was arrested i was always optimistic and i held to and was guided by my views of course my views developed over the course of time but i have always believed in what i did and never acted against my conscience
4542091 shukhov felt pleased with life as he went to sleep
4542092 at various times and in various countries there have arisen heated angry and exquisite debates as to whether art and the artist should be free to live for themselves or whether they should be forever mindful of their duty towards society and serve it albeit in an unprejudiced way for me there is no dilemma
4542093 choking with pathological hatred for the country in which he was born
4542094 when modern western states were created the following principle was proclaimed governments are meant to serve man and man lives to be free to pursue happiness now at last during the past decades technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the welfare state one psychological detail has been overlooked the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many western faces with worry and even depression though it is customary to conceal such feelings active and tense competition permeates all human thoughts without opening a way to free spiritual development
4542095 no one can bar the road to truth and to advance its cause i am prepared to accept even death
4542096 tax policy is likely to fail as an efficient or effective response to iowas flooding disaster and moves to rebuild
4542097 as this report shows property tax cuts may seem to be an easy choice but their help to individual property owners will be marginal in many cases and they will be poorly targeted and waste resources that can be better used in other ways
4542098 tax policy should not be the first choice for policy responses and there are serious questions of whether it should wind up as part of the mix at all
4542099 they have to be implemented when they can effectively help they have to be able to reach those most directly affected and in need of assistance and they need to be temporary with time specific goals
4542100 everyone involved in the ongoing and coming policy discussion needs to recognize the validity of a principles based response developed on the experiences of other states that have coped with disasters this approach not only will best serve iowa residents but help us to provide a good example for the future
4542101 clearly many families and businesses in iowa have been devastated by flooding
4542102 the question is not whether people need help but how best to get it to them tax cuts aren t the best option
4542103 when some lawmakers and others are raising ideas about cutting property taxes they re avoiding critical issues of how best to target assistance to those most in need and how we can pay for the services needed
4542104 as this report shows property tax cuts may seem to be an easy choice but their help to individual property owners will be marginal in many cases and they will be poorly targeted and waste resources that can be better used in other ways
4542105 tax policy should not be the first choice for policy responses and there are serious questions of whether it should wind up as part of the mix at all
4542106 this is not a time for business as usual in our policy options iowa too often has turned to tax cuts as a silver bullet for economic issues and the only sure thing about that approach is that it winds up limiting options
4542107 we recognize the need to ensure we help them meet their needs for their families while we continue to invest in the development of our people and protect the interest of our investors
4542108 the parties appreciated the peacemaking effort of the other and agreed to the continuation of the contacts and cooperation necessary in order to overcome the brutal after effects of the military operations on innocent civilians
4542109 you have hundreds of thousands of people being caught in a financial nightmare
4542110 i believe we have crossed the rubicon and established the premise that the investors will be helped the nightmare will end
4542111 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4542112 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4542113 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4542114 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4542115 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4542116 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright

4542121 the wildest piano pumpin rock n roll show since jerry lee lewis
4542122 in the arena of commerce in particular there is nothing like the threat of recession economic turmoil and market uncertainty when it comes to separating the real leaders from the pretenders in the midst of a rapidly shifting global economy seemingly filled with limitless amounts of both adversity and opportunity true leaders stand out from the rest leaders dont chase fortune and fame they serve missions and are able to articulate a future for that mission in clear simple language they understand that wealth and power are not primary objectives but inevitable byproducts of fulfilling a need and making a consistent positive investment in achieving a larger goal leaders have vision leaders are able to adapt evolve and expand to fit the times without ever losing sight of their mission and core values they see change not as a threat but as a natural part of their environment and understand that what worked yesterday will not necessarily work today or tomorrow they are willing to strike out in new directions to get better results leaders take risks leaders make a tangible difference that goes beyond revenues and profits measurably influencing and changing lives they understand what matters to people including their workers customers and partners and can get them to act to serve those interests leaders motivate leaders rarely need to actually declare that they are leaders their work products services personal conduct and professional performance speak for themselves leaders lead by example leaders dont just do things to with or for people they do things through people they are masters at communicating the vision inspiring and equipping their people to serve the mission welcoming their ideas and contributions and clearing the way for their success leaders empower that means leaders must not only make a difference leaders must be the difference

4542133 the southern philippines a loosely governed area with extensive coastline access to the sulawesi sea was in the throes of civil conflict and vulnerable to economic hardship criminal activity and natural disasters the kinds of conditions that transnational terrorist groups were taking advantage of to establish safe haven terrorists could easily transit the sulawesi sea between the philippines malaysia and indonesia the u s provided military assistance to help train the philippines national army to root out abu sayyaf group and jemaah islamiya organization terrorists which allowed philipines military and police to provide security and gain the trust of the local population more than 80 of the embassy strategy however involved supporting the peace and reconciliation process between the government of the philippines and the moro islamic liberation front milf and providing multi sectoral development assistance to the people of the southern philippines as areas become devoid of terrorists and supporters at the same time we looked for ways to support and build the capacity of other southeast asian nations in their own efforts to secure their borders and maintain maritime domain awareness this regional strategy went a long way to help create an area less amenable to terrorist causes and deprived terrorists of significant safe haven and training areas a development with significant impact on the entire region the idea of the rsi is to acknowledge through policy development and resource allocation that a comprehensive approach to terrorism will require all elements of national power and a regional perspective to address the conditions that terrorists exploit
4542134 i would feel more optimistic about a bright future for man if he spent less time proving that he can outwit nature and more time tasting her sweetness and respecting her seniority
4542135 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4542136 theyve got a ton of momemtum carrying them into beijing
4542137 and they have both got a lot to prove this time around following disappointing results in athens
4542138 if they hadnt competed in the lucerne world cup theyd have been completely under the radar
4542139 were going for a medal but its not like were the top contenders going in
4542140 were both really aggressive you know we both push at the same time
4542141 we will pool our talents and leverage already established friends of the family organizations to launch a grass roots and grass tops effort to register women voters organize a national get out the vote effort around womens issues
4542142 our long term goal is to cultivate and groom women to run for public office at all levels of government including the presidency
4542143 the first order of business for our group is to persuade candidates for the presidency senate and house to incorporate a number of womens rights goals and policies into their platforms
4542144 one womens rights issue conspicuously missing from our list abortion
4542145 its not that the new agenda doesnt view choice as a central womens issue its that roe v wade has been used a single defining issue to hold women voters hostage in the past there are many other issues that are important and relevant to a broad spectrum of women
4542146 although several names were put on a to do list chris matthews was our unanimous choice as the worst offender on womens issues therefore the first person on whom we will focus
4542147 there was enough brain power in that room to do just about anything we are looking to help the women of our country who often have no voice we are hoping to make life better for women in all walks of life
4542148 while we have had a much better dialogue with the mccain campaign i believe both sides increasingly understand that the votes of women over the age of 40 will determine this race
4542149 right now tropic thunder is considered a much bigger title because of the actors in it everything weve seen so far predicts that it will be number one at the box office this weekend with star wars the clone wars at number two
4542150 if this was a live action movie i can assure you that it would have been a box office giant
4542151 this movie looks like a great video game with a lot of action to it but that definitely makes it different than what star wars fans are used to
4542152 well have to wait to see how die hard fans respond this animated film has tremendous growth potential its refreshing the franchise and making it younger thats a great marketing move
4542153 this movie could be a big surprise and make more money than anyone has anticipated
4542154 star wars is a huge brand with a strong worldwide following that alone allows the people behind the franchise to be totally creative and get away with it
4542155 fans will appreciate that after six star wars movies this is something totally different
4542156 we have definitely seen a lift in the star wars franchise since the ad campaign for the clone wars began
4542157 whenever a sequel or prequel is about to be released that generates a lot of activity in dvd sales catalogue rentals usually triple in a situation like this
4542158 the world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender there are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind there are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined we have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith we have enough greed we need more goodness we have enough vanity we need more virtue we have enough popularity we need more purity
4542159 machine spit out and away it goes no telling how long it had been sitting there

4542166 im only 19 so i dont know what it was like then
4542167 at first i couldnt imagine dancing in front of so many people im normally quite shy but when i dance i get a bit crazy you have to
4542168 we just try to do cute things to make people laugh its a great feeling to be able to do that
4542169 if you feel your clothes coming loose or your bra slipping it can be a bit scary but you cant panic or at least let it show
4542170 i will be playing a guest checking into the hotel and i am going to film my scenes sometime next week i think jerry oconnell is hysterical have you guys seen his video on that website funny or die and i cant wait to meet niecy nash
4542171 we remain hopeful that well see a tentative agreement this weekend
4542172 hitler eva braun y 13 jerarcas nazis aterrizaron en barcelona el 27 de abril de 1945 en un vuelo que parti de berl n e hizo escala en linz austria
4542173 viajaron en un junker 290 n mero de serie 0163 c digo pipq que tiempo despu s fue localizado por los aliados en un aeropuerto naval de la localidad de travem nde cercana a hamburgo
4542174 apenas fue un trampol n para el escape de hitler en submarino hacia suram rica
4542175 el documento del fbi fechado en mayo de 1947 cobra valor uniendo todos estos datos hist ricos aunque mi teor a es que hitler estuvo en espa a no m s de un mes y ya hab a abandonado ese pa s cuando el ej rcito estadounidense lo busc all
4542176 los alemanes dejaron cad veres en los b nkers con credenciales de sus jerarcas para que el mundo creyera que se trataba de ellos incluso se utilizaron varios dobles de hitler
4542177 hab a recibido varios cad veres que pertenec an supuestamente a hitler

4542181 the situation is running too long and i think that everything will be decided this week
4542182 its not a no go area talking about wembley when england crashed out the european championship qualifiers the boys have smashed him about it already
4542183 he takes it in good humour because hes a top guy he takes the banter well and weve got a good team spirit im not naming names but paul robinson smashed him to bits its the best way to get over it hes only 22 and has time ahead of him on the international team
4542184 steve mcclaren may not have made a mistake but if scott went with experience and wasnt chucked into the deep end that might have been the wiser choice
4542185 he was given his chance and didnt take it on the night but the next time hopefully he will and prove to be a great keeper for england i still think hes got a bright future at our club and for england as well

4542194 for many months i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia including a high level and neutral international mediator and a genuine international peacekeeping force not simply russian troops no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
4542195 this has been a negotiation between close allies and friends and while there have naturally been ups and downs throughout that entire process ive been gratified that we have both delegations that is to say have approached this in the spirit of trying to do something that was important for both countries securities and as allies and friends
4542196 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations but by the same token my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4542197 i accuse the government of russia of deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing and i can prove it with international organizations already bringing testimony to what im saying and weve received 1 400 reports of brutal attacks slaughters rapes and internment of people in violation of rules of geneva conventions and international humanitarian law
4542198 the israeli report on the killing of fadel has grown fears among palestinian journalists covering the conflict with israel in the gaza between the palestinians and the israelis in the gaza strip about the mission you know the mission to cover and to film and we have been hearing from all other colleagues that they are not certain they are not sure about their lives anymore after such a report which makes clear that the mere raising of a camera in the street in a refugee camp or near the border can put someones life in danger
4542199 in this incident on april 16th six civilians were killed by flechette darts a weapon that is illegal that should not be being used in these conditions in the gaza strip and one of the six was a journalist for all of these reasons i would have expected the army to have opened and conducted a very thorough investigation into this case and they chose not to do so the lack of accountability in this case is reflected in the lack of accountability for thousands of palestinians who have been killed in the occupied territories

4542230 it the deal made perfect sense for us to acquire rather than build a new application
4542231 adding dbcams to it makes the desktop product more complete weve had good experience on the online office side in adding portfolio management
4542232 i can say with confidence that a dbcams user today isnt going to notice any significant changes anytime soon integrations data sharing consolidation of reports over the longer term is likely we wouldnt do anything to remove any of the functionality that advisers rely on
4542233 the intention is not to force advisers to buy something they dont want like buying principia and then being forced to buy dbcams or vice versa
4542234 what this does for us is it enables true straight through processing for clients and advisers until now we have still relied on a wet signature when it comes to account opening
4542235 its going to eliminate rekeying data from crm systems or other databases the advisers may be using and allow them to get that directly into fidelity or non fidelity forms
4542236 online validation minimizes the number of applications and other forms that arrive to fidelity not in good order so with this technology weve reduced the chances that an adviser will get a nigo

4542241 we walked the course and talked about some options to better prepare him for later on in the competition because sometimes he can be a handful
4542242 but tonight he was as george said textbook it was one of the thrills of my life to have a horse like this that can do this is so special im so lucky he really wants to jump clean and everything worked out just as we had planned in there i have a lot of confidence in my horse
4542243 it was a very good course for him the triple combination was a good gymnastic for him as he can be an aggressive horse and the distances got shorter as you went through

4542260 london has had a very high traffic density and therefore high emissions for many years now the fuso canter eco hybrid truck will let us show that transport services can be more environmentally friendly in urban traffic
4542261 mitsubishi fuso offers the fuso canter eco hybrid in japan since 2006 and hits the growing interest of costumers in europe
4542262 however for many customers the relatively high cost of a hybrid is an obstacle to actually purchasing one together with its partners daimler is investing in this pilot project in order to find out how economical the hybrid is for customers in comparison with conventional drive systems and to optimize product development with regard to customers requirements

4542265 in order to bring a nation to support the burdens of great military establishments it is necessary to create an emotional state akin to psychology there must be the portrayal of external menace this involves the development of a nation hero nation villain ideology and the arousing of the population to a sense of sacrifice
4542266 this war may last for the rest of our lives
4542267 to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy

4542273 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4542274 he loved black music r amp b was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4542275 didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4542276 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4542277 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4542278 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4542279 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4542280 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4542281 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4542282 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4542283 they insist velocity is not just a parking spot until another big corporate job comes their way
4542284 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4542285 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4542286 unfortunately housing activity continues to worsen job losses continue inflation is rampant credit is more difficult to obtain and firms remain cautious about capital investments
4542287 we think manufacturing will remain in a slow shallow downward trend until early 2009
4542288 without the lifeline from the rest of the world the manufacturing picture would be a lot darker
4542289 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4542290 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4542291 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright

4542296 everything it just doesnt stop i feel sorry for people who cant afford a lot of things now
4542297 you notice the difference in the groceries yes every week you see the difference
4542298 if it wasnt for the exchange rate it wouldnt be bad at all

4542300 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything

4542303 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4542304 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4542305 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4542306 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4542307 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4542308 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4542309 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4542310 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4542311 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians
4542312 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4542313 woe is me heres what is happening in my life
4542314 this is what i have to say about insert topic here
4542315 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4542316 i would like to congratulate the maoists for entering multi party competitive politics
4542317 we will stay in opposition and keep an eye on the maoists activities while they run the government we will oppose their actions if their activities incline towards autocracy
4542318 the integration of peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4542319 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4542320 he had no choice but to wear a swimsuit of another swimmer that was over stretched and caused drag especially behind the knees
4542321 water entered the suit and that caused a drag which affected her swim
4542322 but that would have taken time and the sixth heat was to begin
4542323 i do however think the judges scored her too low
4542324 she could have gotten a higher score but judges will likely not give a score on a new participant
4542325 so that judges get to know her and the ability of philippine divers
4542326 ive told our coach that we should perform dives with high degrees of difficulties in the first place we have tried them before and i was successful
4542327 while ultimately change must come from within burma the international community has an important role to play to signal strong support for the courageous burmese people i have supported sanctions against burma and welcome the additional sanctions the president announced
4542328 now that the united states is involved it should stay involved with the full strength of our diplomacy
4542329 would you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea
4542330 and the reason is this the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous ronald reagan constantly spoke to the soviet union at a time when he called them an evil empire he understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward
4542331 sex in crisis the new sexual revolution and the future of american politics

4542334 max is fortunate to have an individual with jims experience insights and talents join our board
4542335 the growth for education and training will be in continuing adult education online delivery is the trigger for this growth but the demand for lifetime education stems from profound changes in society we live in an economy where knowledge not buildings and machinery is the chief resource and where knowledge workers make up the biggest part of the work force
4542336 i said go for it follow your dreams and when you make it to the olympics ill be there for you
4542337 if it hadnt been for donovan and my other supporters i wouldnt have done as well as i did
4542338 for some reason there was a feeling inside of me that made me think he was going to make it almost like an omen
4542339 we shouldve finished second and brought home the silver medal
4542340 they used the davis cup rule with quarterfinal losers automatically out of medal contention
4542341 borck was a clever penetrator very skillful in dribbling and a master at changing pace ciria cruz was a high leaper like marzan who played center the players were brainy athletic and worked well together
4542342 personally i dont think well ever qualify again because our opponents are taller and stronger
4542343 other teams have improved when the pba was formed in 1975 things fell apart for the national team because pros were not allowed to participate in the olympics now that pros are allowed we should be competitive again if not for politics to make it back to the olympics our players must be smarter quicker and better outside shooters
4542344 weve got to hit the three with as much consistency as scoring a lay up
4542345 then there are the economic and scientific factors to contend with so its not easy to get back into olympic basketball

4542370 tshom knows its going to be his last olympics hes getting old thats why hes so motivated to win
4542371 i have trained very hard in korea and my competitors in the olympics also trained as hard under the same coaches and went through the same regimen
4542372 so all of us are just about even this is going to be a battle of nerves
4542373 the first steps are important thats been a problem for me ever since but i have improved on that
4542374 i have trained well and hard i know how my rivals play the game all of us are just about even you cannot ignore any single player in the end its not your skills or stamina that will make you win if i win here its because i have the will to win this is now or never and with the prayers of our fellow filipinos i hope i will achieve it
4542375 we did some light training in manila and we are coming here with a very high confidence
4542376 our aim is to win a medal thats what we came here for and we hope to achieve it with the prayers of the filipino people
4542377 their confidence is very high their minds are clear and their heart is burning with a desire to win
4542378 well still practice to keep their confidence high and keep their focus on winning a medal

4542395 conditions were extremely difficult and ultimately i didnt shoot well enough in the wind to be honest i dont feel that i fired any bad shots i just had trouble negotiating the conditions

4542419 if that means trying to get it right with six seven or eight sports i would rather do that than try to go too wide
4542420 beijing is an indicator of what the gap is between us and our competitors
4542421 we do need to take a look at strategic investments in some of those sports where we could put in 300 000 or 400 000 and get some results
4542422 australia did it all the time in archery for example but we have to have the right information
4542423 if we dont have the expertise in canada then we need to go overseas and get them there but we have to be careful that we dont say were going to pay a coach a huge salary and then not give him the tools to do the job
4542424 ive come from a system where often in the early days so many services were pushed on sport they didnt know which ones were the important ones
4542425 i do believe we shouldnt be here just to participate
4542426 ive never believed in just making the national team and being happy and satisfied with that
4542427 if our athletes are here there should be a realistic chance to get to the podium
4542428 its never time to modify the medal projection until the gun goes at the end of the games
4542429 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team
4542430 theres our bubble as we call it and we try to stay in that as much as we can
4542431 we dont read comments we dont read forums we dont read all the websites nothing like that
4542432 you dont want to get brought down by negativity we all want to be that one to win the first medal because thats pretty awesome but were all doing the best we can
4542433 you cant think about medals because then it throws you off
4542434 you have to think ok what am i going to do that is going to get me to that wall and get me there as fast as i can go
4542435 the russian federations invasion of the republic of georgia a sovereign and democratic nation on the eve of the 2008 summer olympics makes it an unacceptable host for the 2014 winter games
4542436 russias blatant violation of the long respected olympic truce should be enough for the ioc to join with us in choosing a more worthy venue for the 2014 winter olympics
4542437 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community we stand by georgia our friend and ally and call on the ioc to designate a new venue for the russian olympics

4542445 shadow this incident has unfairly cast over his mr lines good name
4542446 to the extent that i can give him that back on behalf of this court im happy to do so
4542447 stokes amp levin did not serve the sec subpoenas on mr
4542448 an egregious wrong was committed against mr lines contrary to the strident public statements made by the sec suggesting mr lines had been served with sec formal process the court has made an express finding that he was not
4542449 the award to mr lines is exceptional and reflects the seriousness of the injustice done to him we believe this ruling will restore mr lines reputation in the business community
4542450 as many council services were contracted out it would cost about 30 00 per time to fly the eu flag in various locations throughout the city

4542454 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4542455 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4542456 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4542457 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4542458 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4542461 we have great confidence both in belcos strategic management and the companys ability to deliver safe and reliable electricity however the current state of energy markets with crude continuing to trade over 125 barrel combined with ongoing growth in bermudian consumers will make for a difficult near term operating environment belco has some interesting ideas and initiatives related to renewable energy but these are several years away from fruition and in the interim the company will be reliant on conventional forms of electricity production such as heavy oil and natural gas
4542462 has an attractive dividend and valuation relative to most utilities however the pass through of high fuel costs to customers will likely continue to hurt average residential consumption because of conservation efforts at home on the positive side belcos healthy balance sheet will help fund near term capacity expansion programs while in the long run renewable energy initiatives will help keep bermuda green

4542519 my gut instinct is that there will be a wide disparity about what rates are quoted on these sites and what they actually end up with and not necessarily due to the borrower

4542521 its easy reliable accurate and fast theres no bait and switch
4542522 all those dubious loan requests they can be flagged by the community
4542523 there is a plus in not having to give personal information but you still have to ask yourself whos in and whos not included in the system

4542532 these three facsimiles of egyptian documents in the pearl of great price depict the most common objects in the mortuary religion of egypt joseph smiths interpretations of them as part of a unique revelation through abraham therefore very clearly demonstrates that he was totally unacquainted with the significance of these documents and absolutely ignorant of the simplest facts of egyptian writing and civilization
4542533 it may be safely said that there is not one single word that is true in these explanations
4542534 it is difficult to deal seriously with joseph smiths impudent fraud smith has turned the goddess in facsimile no 1 into a king and osiris into abraham

4542660 the team may have been posing for an ad that was for sports fans in spain but when i saw the photo it felt like they were making the slant eyes at me
4542661 i usually go about ignoring such things but when someone says as has often been incorrectly alleged id abuse a romantic attachment as a publicity stunt or to promote a new movie of mine thats really just way below the belt
4542662 to love and be loved is the most beautiful thing that can happen to a person and ones own life is much more important than all the glamour and fame in the world
4542663 its true that i spent some time regularly taking part in sessions with a psychiatrist
4542664 i find it to be very normal to lie on a couch every once in a while and to let your head be straightened out and your heart

4542666 boasting eight years of one of the most successful presidencies of our era clintons presence at the convention will only magnify baracks deficiencies and signal to americans how ill prepared obama is to be president
4542667 bill clinton presided over the longest period of peace time economic expansion in american history which included a balanced budget and a federal surplus
4542668 hes down to earth plays the saxophone and loves to eat mcdonalds hamburgers and is in touch with middle america while obama is an arugula eating admitted cocaine user who accuses people of being racist and clinging to their guns and religion
4542669 his refusal to visit injured us troops on his grand tour across europe and the middle east also demonstrates an extreme lack of character furthermore the mounting evidence and recent developments regarding his religious background and facts surrounding his true identity raise numerous questions he must be thoroughly vetted the fact that he has taken such steps to hide his background is cause for concern
4542670 obama has life long associations with racist pastors dirty slumlords and terrorist sympathizers
4542671 to step up stand up and stick up for our soldiers
4542672 that the market seems to do better when barack obama is having problems
4542673 donating more to obamas campaign than to the campaign of sen john mccain r az 9 6 million in donations from employees working for securities mortgage and drug companies compared with mccains 6 6 million
4542674 their support comes even as obama seeks higher taxes for wealthy americans
4542675 looking ahead to the conventions we had finally hit on the formula that integrated msnbc and nbc news the guy we were going to lean on was tim russert i think wed be best advised to take that time we were going to give to tim and just be silent in his memory i dont know what were going to do without him i mean that in the philosophical way but also practically speaking
4542676 we used to consider ourselves gavel to gavel that doesnt make sense any more for lots of reasons were not cspan they perform a public service but we provide more than that
4542677 from acting as a legal adviser in the trial of an accused terrorist at the guant namo war court

4542692 this much is clear presidential candidates ignore the importance of the values based vote at their peril
4542693 in 2004 although the war in iraq dominated the headlines it didnt dominate at the polls a small plurality of voters cited moral values as the most important issue in the campaign bush crushed sen john kerry among these voters by a whopping 62 percent margin 80 percent to 18 percent
4542694 if white evangelicals had not voted in 2004 kerry would have beaten bush by a 53 to 45 percent margin nationwide

4542697 i would like to take this opportunity to apologise to him his friends and family for any distortion of public opinion or distress that my comments may have had and i hope this letter serves to go some way to correct that
4542698 we heard a similar story quite often if a doctor retired or died or there was a merger or another practice took over the patients they patients would have difficulty getting their records back to take to another doctor
4542699 there were even stories of records being found in the rubbish bin in the doctors garage or even on the footpath

4542767 he played a major role in bringing black music to the masses and in the evolution of rhythm and blues to soul music
4542768 beyond that he really developed the role of the record producer jerry did a lot more than just turn on a tape recorder he left his stamp on a lot of great music he had a commercial ear as well as a critical ear
4542769 he was incredibly abrasive and incredibly generous very abrupt and very very patient seemingly a pure sharklike businessman and also a cerebral and creative genius
4542770 its funky its deep its very emotional but its clean
4542771 how could he understand what was inside of black people like that

4542774 one guy said this and one guy said that and i said rhythm and blues and they said oh that sounds pretty good lets do that in the next issue that section came out as rhythm and blues instead of race
4542775 when i said i wanted to sing like that jerry said the best way was to get a pianist and learn how those songs are done
4542776 one thing jerry wexler taught me was that if youve got a sexy or torchy song you mustnt attitudinize on top of it because it sounds redundant

4542793 i dont think so i think its about getting in touch with reality about balancing aspirations and actuality
4542794 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
4542795 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
4542796 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
4542797 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
4542798 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
4542799 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
4542800 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
4542801 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
4542802 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
4542803 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
4542804 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
4542805 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
4542806 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
4542807 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
4542808 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
4542809 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face

4542816 the complaint filed by the sec presents a disturbingly distorted portrayal of a bona fide financing transaction in which lom participated nearly five years ago
4542817 the secs allegations relate to loms bona fide efforts to arrange financing for the acquisition and operation of several mining properties in canada and central america in february 2003
4542818 todays charges reflect the secs fundamental misunderstanding of the transactions at issue after the sec suspended trading of sedona stock these same mining assets were acquired by various canadian public companies which successfully operated them the secs allegations relating to trading in shep technologies likewise concern loms legitimate business dealings
4542819 lom does not expect that the filing of these charges will have any bearing on our operations our clients or the viability of the firm we are hopeful that this development marks the beginning of the conclusion of a matter that should have been concluded long ago
4542820 it is unthinkable that the sec would ever treat a u s based broker dealer the way that it has treated lom the sec has targeted lom despite our efforts to uphold the highest standards of responsible corporate citizenship and compliance

4542959 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point
4542960 this gives us a better picture of what countries discriminate against us based on religion

4542972 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4542973 i was in high school when she hit it big
4542974 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4542975 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off

4542979 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women

4542981 film which appealed to older women because of its portrayal of the late 40s and 50s as a still sexy time of life
4542982 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4542983 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4542984 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4542985 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself

4542993 jeg starter altid med at stole p folk jeg skal arbejde sammen med selvf lgelig bliver man skuffet af og til men set i den store sammenh ng er det en lille ting generelt v rds tter medarbejderne deres frihed og forst r deres ansvar

4543006 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4543007 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4543008 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4543009 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4543010 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4543011 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4543012 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4543013 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4543111 who would want to date a man who has to wear a bulletproof vest everywhere he goes ciara has lost her mind

4543120 but in this case i want to be very clear all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4543121 if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa
4543122 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4543123 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4543124 americans are consuming our olympic coverage in record numbers and in every way through broadcast cable online and mobile whats particularly encouraging to me is the strength in the young male demo which has shown the largest increase of any age group

4543153 nobody rejects the principle of territorial integrity as one of the fundamental principles of international law
4543154 but if we look at this concrete situation we see it is very complex unfortunately after what has happened the people of south ossetia and abkhazia could hardly live together in one state with the georgians
4543155 i made it clear that first of all it is always very sad if there are victims and in this case there are so many victims secondly i said that even if i take the russian version of events into account i considered some of the russian actions not to be reasonable in particular the presence of the russian troops in the core regions of georgia

4543211 and your point is what nobody said it was proof that all layers everywhere at all times in earths history have formed quickly what i have been saying over and over and over which apparently took you two weeks to figure out is that these layers had to have formed quickly you cannot have a living tree or a dead tree taking millions of years to be buried in a vertical position by horizontal layers is that so difficult why the straw man argument now now that you realize the problem with polystrate trees and the problem with carbon dating perhaps we can advance beyond kindergarten and explain to you that all of the radiometric dating schemes operate in open systems are seriously flawed and not reliable for dating the age of the earth obviously if the trees do not represent millions of years of sedimentation neither do the fossils found in the same layers represent millions of years of evolution rather what you see is the sequence in which things were rapidly buried
4543212 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve
4543213 radiometric methodologies would have to be out by a factor of 3 4 of a million
4543214 polystrate trees prove several things 1 the layers that they penetrate did not take millions of years to form 2 coal does not take millions of years to form since polystrate trees sometimes penetrate multiple seams 3 coal is formed from floating trees not peat 4 the rock strata between the coal layers did not take millions of years to form 5 the fossils embedded within the strata do not represent millions of years of evolution
4543215 1 that is not all that hard to explain 2 hello one ringy dingy two ringy dingy i dont either apology accepted if that is what it was like i said we can move beyond kindergarten if you will stop throwing your bottle out of the crib and screaming for your binky
4543216 i find it interesting that so many people have accepted the prevailing theory and despite knowing that our elections cannot be secured from insider fraud or outright theft devote a lot of time and energy debating which tyrant or dictator might be less despotic or more benevolent and urging people to vote for that candidate even though there is no way to hold them accountable if it should turn out that they arent less despotic or more benevolent after all
4543217 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

4543221 johnson says the american empire is notable for being based on military bases instead of the occupation of territory and he identifies five sorrows of empire the first being racism on p28 rightly the author says racism is inherent in the attitudes required to dominate other cultures militarily the other four sorrows johnson lists almost 260 pages later they are a state of perpetual war the loss of domestic democracy destruction of public truthfulness and finally financial bankruptcy tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true

4543232 i have found something at last that has and is proving itself organizationally and materially i could hardly believe the advance sfi commission checks being sent to me after only the first few weeks after joining the program the sky is the limit

4543234 in the case of either of these definitions the question arises why isnt nancy pelosi obstructing justice when she continues to refuse to hold the hearings on impeachment for bush and cheney which have been presented to the house that leads us to another huge case of obstructing justice in the case of michael muskasey attorney general who refuses to hold hearings on a number of cases namely the recent attorney hiring fiasco

4543240 the past two years have absolutely been the worst i have had the most appalling abuse from the public drivers and police over exercising their authority
4543241 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4543242 parliament clearly intended that councils should use the new powers and generally they are being used to respond to residents complaints about fly tippers rogue traders and those defrauding the council tax or housing benefit system
4543243 dog fouling is at the top of their list in terms of issues they want the council to be tackling on the ground so i know the public are only too pleased to see us catching people
4543244 i dont think councils are abusing their powers but there have been one or two instances where it could be said that perhaps some of the offences being investigated were too trivial to be using surveillance techniques
4543245 this is about using quite serious powers that are meant for crime not minor matters
4543246 we need stronger checks and balances against the potential abuse of such powers to protect the rights of law abiding citizens from labours growing surveillance state
4543247 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4543248 with pensioners by the time they sit down their hats always come off anyway because they were brought up with manners so usually take their hats off indoors
4543249 asking a yorkshireman to take off his flat cap whoever heard of anything so silly
4543250 its a yorkshire tradition men wearing flat caps although youngsters dont bother these days older men still wear them and should be allowed to continue
4543251 i still wear a flat cap when i go out shopping and often leave it on when i get home and end up sitting watching tv with my cap on they look smart and they keep your head nice and warm
4543252 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4543253 the fact that she did not report her concerns resulted in a failure to protect the interests of patients because any action to be taken by the trust was delayed the very act of filming a patient without consent is a serious matter in itself irrespective of whether no further dissemination of the footage takes place
4543254 i was taken aback i was shocked to know that i was on duty on the day and i wasnt informed about any of the incidents when i could have done something about it
4543255 does the film show that the care delivery at ealing hospital between september and december 2004 was shocking
4543256 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4543257 do we really want the police security services and other organs of the state to have access to more and more aspects of our private lives
4543258 im not saying its right or wrong but i think there should be absolute full transparency
4543259 we do have to stand up and say these are our fundamental liberties and our freedoms and lines have to be drawn somewhere and there should be a full democratic debate about where exactly the lines should be drawn
4543260 the changes to the way we communicate due particularly to the internet revolution will increasingly undermine our current capabilities to obtain communications data essential for counter terrorism and investigation of crime purpose and use it to protect the public
4543261 to ensure that the agencies can continue to use this valuable tool the government is planning to bring forward the communications data bill
4543262 putting all this data into the hands of the government will threaten our security not make it better
4543263 ministers have shown time and time again that they cannot be trusted with sensitive data there is no reason to think they will be any less slapdash with our phone and internet records
4543264 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4543265 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4543266 it is a british way of life to have your bins emptied once a week taking that away is like losing your birthright
4543267 a waste collection authority is not obliged to collect household waste that is placed for collection in contravention of a requirement under this section
4543268 it is disgraceful that these new laws are being rushed through parliament with no debate and no vote
4543269 people genuinely want to improve recycling and go green but labours policy of bin cuts and bin taxes will fuel fly tipping backyard burning and harm public health
4543270 these changes will fuel the public backlash at the governments rubbish policy under gordon brown local residents are paying exorbitant levels of council tax but are failing to get decent public services in return
4543271 it is in no way in councils interests to use tactics that would alienate local people it would be wholly counterproductive for town halls to approach this issue in a heavy handed way that could put people off dealing with their rubbish responsibly
4543272 councils always provide people with straightforward information about what to do with their rubbish and work with residents to reduce the amount they produce and to encourage them to recycle
4543273 britain is the dustbin of europe throwing away more per household than any other country in the eu we have to change radically the way that we get rid of our rubbish and the days of tipping everything into a hole in the ground are long gone
4543274 there is still a general duty to collect rubbish free from households all that has changed is that when a household is given a formal notice if they dont abide by it then the council no longer has a duty to collect
4543275 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4543276 film goers should be informed of the presence of the cameras so that they can go elsewhere if they are unhappy with being filmed themselves
4543277 i go to the cinema to watch other people be filmed not to be filmed myself
4543278 im not happy about it isnt that why going to the cinema is so fun so you can have a kiss and a cuddle in the back row it is a complete infringement of my civil liberties
4543279 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4543280 provide important information and will be able to get out messages about antisocial behaviour
4543281 we are interrupting coverage to remind you that bathing in the fountains is prohibited
4543282 citizens are reminded that they can cut their carbon footprint by not leaving their tvs on standby
4543283 i was just having a cigarette and causing no bother to anyone else but this is like big brother is watching you
4543284 it would be inappropriate for ceredigion county council to comment on individual cases
4543285 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4543286 i find it extraordinary so the government is funding commercial television productions highlighting government policy presumably they dont criticise government policy
4543287 it allows the government to have more air time and get its message across to people
4543288 people want the government to put police on our streets not propaganda on our television sets
4543289 documentaries of this nature play an important role in informing the public openly and transparently about the work of the police and uk border agency
4543290 the home office do not influence the content of these programmes after they are commissioned and they adhere to ofcoms strict guidelines on this kind of programme

4543303 por la corona arrancaba el viernes en la televisi n local y la presidenta de la organizaci n miss puerto rico universe magali febles asegur que las m s de 70 candidatas est n muy entusiasmadas porque es la primera vez que se escoger n por voto del p blico cinco aspirantes que entrar n directamente al cuadro semifinal
4543304 ellas tienen un jurado que es fuerte y este jurado las eval a y van a dar una puntuaci n pero quien verdaderamente decide qui nes van a entrar al cuadro semifinal es el p blico a trav s de mensajes de texto donde se escoger n cinco chicas que pasar n directo a la semifinal explic febles quien adem s funge como productora ejecutiva del espacio televisivo
4543305 es bien interesante porque generalmente la gente ve la parte bonita de los concursos cuando las muchachas est n desfilando en traje de ba o traje de gala y el jurado le hace la pregunta
4543306 se ve el esfuerzo que ellas hacen y las frustraciones los corajes las l grimas es una novela de la vida diaria pero sin libreto
4543307 aqu la gente se va a dar cuenta que las reinas son de carne y hueso y vienen de todo tipo de n cleos familiares

4543311 spatio temporal modification of collagen scaffolds mediated by triple helical propensity
4543312 collagen is a great house for a cell to grow but there are places where you should not have collagen
4543313 tumors or blood clots that can lead to a stroke are primarily made of collagen
4543314 the collagen mimetic peptide was able to sneak into the natural collagen fibers at regularly spaced intervals where the structure of collagen was more loosely bound
4543315 that tells us that in a natural system the collagen mimetic peptide is binding only to the collagen and not to other proteins and that has never been shown before
4543316 cmp can penetrate tissue that the antibodies which are at least 20 times larger cannot
4543317 the longer the chain the longer cmp tended to stay in place
4543318 one of the areas were working on now is targeted delivery of these functionalized cmps
4543319 the key will be whether we can make them recognize the difference between normal collagen and pathological collagen
4543320 collagen is a very complicated system and we still dont know a lot about it
4543321 using synthetic systems can give you a lot of information and are great for mechanistic studies of cell and scaffold interactions but eventually many scientists come back to the natural scaffold that nature has provided the collagen when they need to create artificial tissues
4543322 imaging and measurement resolutions as well as atomic structural ambiguities defects obscured the results of most experiments and provided unreliable mechanical predictions
4543323 we can be certain of all the quantities we have measured and the results match quantum mechanics predictions very well
4543324 irradiating a multiwalled carbon nanotube with an intense electron beam actually forms bonds among the shells of the tube this is like combining multiple nanotubes into one to form a stronger structure
4543325 the same procedure used to strengthen individual multiwalled nanotubes by irradiation may also be used to link together individual nanotubes into a bundle
4543326 not a jack of all trades and master of none but rather an expert across disciplines
4543327 even if the students primary area of study is physics for example he or she should be also capable of producing the quality of biological research expected of biologists
4543328 the innovation of inbt graduate programs is the bringing together of talented students from a wide variety of backgrounds we teach each other about our fields which also requires learning our own more in depth
4543329 the students in a sense play matchmaker for researchers who might not otherwise work together this helps everyone involved produce work that uniquely advances nanobiotechnology in a way that it could not have been had these researchers been working independently
4543330 i really broadened my understanding of molecular biology and was able to work with quantum dots and use lab techniques such as gel electrophoresis or pcr that i had only read about
4543331 it is normal that a new surface has a bit less grip at the beginning but the riders safety commission wanted a new surface because last year the bumps were very very big
4543332 the first corner in the last part was very bad
4543333 its a shame we had two minor falls today i just lost the front while finding the limit but it was nothing major
4543334 my knee is quite sore especially when i have to put a lot of weight on it to change direction but its holding out well and im looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow to continue with what weve learnt today
4543335 the new engine parts have made a huge difference as the bike has more horsepower and improved power management
4543336 the chassis upgrade has helped us to turn better especially into the corners but we need to work on getting a little more feedback from the front end
4543337 i only have some small problems at the front but im sure that well find a good solution to be faster tomorrow
4543338 to be in the top ten since the beginning is very important the tyres are working really well and we can have a good weekend
4543339 valentino rossi and casey stoner are registering amazing lap times but the other riders in front of us are not so far away
4543340 i cant believe it still i worked so hard for many years for this i dont know what to say i couldnt have been here without my parents

4543362 de esta forma podr amos saber de qu se nos acusa para defendernos y si es as justificar el hostigamiento del cual estamos haciendo objeto
4543363 me parece muy curioso que en el canal del estado venezolana de televisi n vtv el conductor de los papeles de mandinga alberto nolia hiciera algunas amenazas en contra de mi novia y alusi n a mi matrimonio meti ndose con mi vida privada cosa que considero muy condenable
4543364 tambi n es muy curioso que haya declaraciones de altos funcionarios del partido socialista unido de venezuela psuv contra mi persona me parece algo ir nico porque yo no represento ninguna posibilidad de inestabilidad pol tica ni mucho menos yo creo que es muy incoherente que se est n haciendo estas presiones en un ambiente en el que m s bien los venezolanos deber amos estar concentrados en una propuesta para el pa s de cara a las elecciones regionales
4543365 i immediately began looking at retail spaces in the city to get an idea of what was possible
4543366 i played a ton of arcade games as a kid thanks to generous parents and arcade games conveniently located any place we went
4543367 i was hooked from the very start and also have fond memories of legend of kage followed by black tiger a bit later on
4543368 arcade gaming died out in the u s for many reasons but i dont think any of them are the reasons most people think about
4543369 the number one reason it died here is because of our coinage system the japanese coin system is coincidentally perfectly made for arcade gaming with 50 yen and 100 yen denominations 50 cents 1 dollar
4543370 ultimately i dont think its a matter of japanese people being any more into gaming than americans
4543371 arcades have been successfully marketed in japan and adapted through an era of change the u s operators just gave up
4543372 japan is a culture built around easy transportation in metro areas and there is always an arcade close by if youre in the city
4543373 it was dirty didnt always smell great and generally looked like it was about to fall apart however this was the kind of place you could go and make life long friends and the arcade machines were always in perfect shape the regulars diligently attended almost every day myself included when i lived there in 2005
4543374 i want to bring back that feature which is long lost in most of the arcades still standing in the u s today

4543459 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4543460 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family

4543464 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult

4543468 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4543469 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4543470 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4543471 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4543472 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4543473 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police

4543516 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4543517 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4543518 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4543519 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4543520 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4543521 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4543522 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4543523 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4543524 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4543525 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4543526 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4543527 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4543528 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4543529 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4543530 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4543531 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4543532 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4543533 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4543534 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
4543535 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
4543536 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
4543537 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
4543538 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
4543539 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
4543540 the inhabitants of the city were filled with terror the likes of which they had never experienced before all they saw were muslims in their midst screaming allahu akbar allah planted terror in their hearts the men were crucified over the course of 24 km
4543541 some even say they put dead men and their own dung in pans kneaded this and ate it a plague like disease descended on them and destroyed a countless throng
4543542 were a very close family but we have been destroyed by this
4543543 why did they take him away thats what we want to know did they have to do that he had barely begun ive been on this earth longer than him
4543544 im asking them the residents to remain calm we want to thank them for all their support but we want them to remain calm because violence leads nowhere
4543545 if those officers were unable to control the situation they should have asked for backup
4543546 writing to let people i dont know know whats going on
4543547 i could have switched majors a long time ago and not be putting myself through this right now
4543548 hoe kun je zeggen dat je niet sero positief bent als je niet negatief bent getest
4543549 i think we talk about it more in the u s than in many parts of the world
4543550 the u s has a history thats of struggle around these issues whether its the civil rights struggle or whether its the abolitionists struggle in the 19th century
4543551 anyone can be around someone here can be offended because were so diverse as compared to other places
4543552 someone would say beforehand ok guys thats not how we want to be represented
4543553 across the globe countries are more homogeneous they feel more comfortable in their own identity as a particular group as spanish or french or portuguese
4543554 we have a history of pushing the envelope on these kinds of things
4543555 if you dont want to get engaged in a deeper analytical discussion thats a logical way to talk about this
4543556 when youre in an airplane you dont want your fuel to start solidifying
4543557 so we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem
4543558 were looking for something that is so correct in its performance that it can be interchanged with petroleum based kerosene
4543559 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling
4543560 it can be grown anywhere you can have a pool of water and expose it to sunlight
4543561 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4543562 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4543563 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4543564 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply
4543565 realistically for anything to be happening at scale enough to actually impact an airlines bottom line were years away

4543568 the prime minister described russias incursion into georgia as a completely unjustified violation of georgias territorial integrity russian forces must withdraw immediately
4543569 were so excited to be returning to the studio to work with jason hes a phenomenal producer and we adore working with him the songs we recorded in february that we originally wanted to release as a four song demo turned out better than anything weve done so far in our career weve decided to put them on our debut record for century media and were returning to jason to finish the album starting september 1 for the demo we did in february we did pre production on the four songs with a wonderful producer named don debiase whos worked with bands like forever in terror and beneath the sky we arent sure if well be able to coordinate schedules with him to do pre production on the remainder of the album because september is right around the corner but we are 100 confirmed to start recording with jason on the 1st we cant wait to finish the album and bring some more metal to you all
4543570 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4543571 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4543572 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4543573 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4543574 the fate of yahoo is not going to change by any addition of these board members
4543575 he is very well aware of the advertising community of madison avenue and the value of content
4543576 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4543577 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4543578 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4543579 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended
4543580 got a lot of folks smart folks analyzing the situation on the ground and of course briefing us on different possibilities that could develop in the area and the region
4543581 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4543582 well doll i had a great time tonight i dont think ive ever just sat here after one of my races and talked for as long as we did would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow night
4543583 he was a special person and he cared about his state
4543584 if he were here he would tell us to not forget what were about and thats taking care of the people
4543585 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4543586 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4543587 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4543588 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4543589 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations
4543590 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4543591 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4543592 russian georgian and south ossetian forces all have an obligation under international humanitarian law to protect civilians from attack
4543593 the latest information on civilian casualties in gori tskhinvali and surrounding areas calls into question whether the forces are respecting that obligation
4543594 victims of the attack described to human rights watch how they saw numerous small explosions within seconds before they fell to the ground
4543595 some of them had been hit by rockets most likely fired from grad launchers weapons that should not be used in areas populated by civilians as they cannot be directed at only military targets and are therefore inherently indiscriminate
4543596 we burned these houses we want to make sure that they the georgians cant come back because if they do come back this will be a georgian enclave again and this should not happen
4543597 two of them didnt do anything to us so we just let them go we couldnt take them anywhere as i had to take care of my own men first the third one seemed to be high on something a normal person would have surrendered and this one was shooting at us instead we questioned him and then executed him
4543598 people are continuing to arrive in north ossetia by the busload and many civilians are wounded
4543599 world vision has also found that many families have been separated from their loved ones in the chaos
4543600 i know she linda told terry she was gonna fix his ass
4543601 but it looks to me like he looks like an angel and she looks like a slut
4543602 i used to really like linda but then we started to get to know her and she is a real drink
4543603 we are very fortunate to have ryan join our staff
4543604 he comes from a great basketball family in cincinnati and he also gained a wealth of experience in his five years at xavier with his background ryan will be a tremendous addition to our staff
4543605 if somethings wrong you have got to complain about it if everyone starts complaining then maybe things will change
4543606 this case did not call into question our prosecutions policy or the need to prosecute fare evasion on londons buses which costs taxpayers more than 30m a year
4543607 complete loose stool water arse gravy of the very worst kind
4543608 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november
4543609 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4543610 to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4543611 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4543612 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4543613 they have known since the day she dropped out that she wanted this for history
4543614 yeah way to go the way obama is handling things he is not electable
4543615 a woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter of a billion dollar campaign operation and then blames sexism in society will dampen the dreams of our daughters
4543616 well why is it that she doesnt like obama anymore
4543617 obama has agreed that senator hillary clintons name will be placed into nomination
4543618 so she becomes vp she is still higher than you
4543619 i am here but i really have no position i will criticize everyone elses though after they take a stand
4543620 put hillary in da convention all the way to da white house 11
4543621 obamas pathetic hes only doing this to garner more votes flip flopper
4543622 sure she can have her name placed in the nomination but after this i dont want hear any more whining
4543623 she will not do anything bad to jeopardize the party or her reputation
4543624 michigan and florida dont dont she didnt need them because she will win the nomination in super tuesday
4543625 wake up america obama is no more american than osama
4543626 i saw her and was tremendously impressed by her comportment
4543627 maybe there was nothing the least bit childish about it and to excite me by way of the mock conducting was why she did it
4543628 the unspoilt countryside and landscape the peace and quiet the healthy environment and the tight knit community all of these will change permanently if this current proposal proceeds
4543629 the wind turbine proposal is the most significant issue that has and will ever face this community we have already seen emotions running high relationships strained and we will no doubt continue to see this this proposal and the poor way in which it is being communicated is destroying the very essence of the valley and its community spirit
4543630 ohhh thats why his singing sounds so off in the album version
4543631 para asumir la copropiedad del proceso que no requiere otra cosa que producir aportes
4543632 it would take forever to sell my planes one at a time
4543633 even if i dont sell each plane for top dollar im still saving on storage costs by moving them all at once
4543634 i talked to a couple auction companies but they kept taking too long to return my calls
4543635 then i saw an ad for united country brad wooley auctioneers in trade a plane and i called theyve taken real good care of me and have been right on top of things
4543636 flipping through the 1928 edition you get a glimpse into the days when 1 500 could buy you 180 acres in rural arkansas two cows 30 hens and a sow tools and hay included while many things have changed since those days the lure of small town america is alive and well and united country continues helping people realize the freedom of owning a piece of the american dream
4543637 my first sense of community as a ku freshman was in the marching band i want others to experience the thrill of being a part pf something extraordinary i know that many students would benefit from a bit of a financial boost which may allow them the opportunity to choose to participate in this great organization
4543638 the problem with this slumping housing market right now is that even qualified home buyers are having trouble qualifying for a home loan
4543639 our method empowers sellers by allowing them to sell their home to any qualified buyer
4543640 by offering temporary owner financing we find that most sellers have a contract in place within the first two weeks
4543641 this is because they can reach more buyers have more showings and get more and better offers from buyers that would normally not consider that home due to lack of financing
4543642 whats really great about our program is that we can even help owners who find themselves facing foreclosure
4543643 when youre under that kind of pressure and need to sell quickly temporary owner financing can be a real life saver
4543644 at smg we are excited to once again be recognized among the nations top firms by honomichl
4543645 which is without question the preeminent authority in the market research industry i attribute this success to smgs dedicated hard working staff and loyal high quality clients
4543646 smg is the best local company that youve never heard of
4543647 every member of our outstanding team feels inspired by the entrepreneurial innovative culture inherent in smgs fiber we have and will continue to hire team members who share a passion for research and ingenuity
4543648 by adding structural engineering we enhance our ability to create design solutions in house
4543649 we now offer a level of coordination responsiveness and thoroughness not previously available to clients and contractors
4543650 one of the biggest areas of benefit to our clients will be the combination of all our disciplines
4543651 a more accurate fully coordinated set of drawings will translate to better constructed projects
4543652 the team may have been posing for an ad that was for sports fans in spain but when i saw the photo it felt like they were making the slant eyes at me
4543653 that is not right and the proof is the way they deal with arab palestinians living in israel and the fact that it is impossible for an eastern jewish an israeli jew of middle eastern origin man to be in a rank of a prime minister
4543654 technically powerful but not as elegant as apples iphone and os x
4543655 google will be competing against other operating system licensers such as symbian and microsoft for design wins around the world
4543656 the triad appears to have prevailed because of old fashion capitalism that values its more centralized location its moving up in stature as a cargo center as the fedex hub nears completion logistics today magazine in its rating of the 50 top logistics friendly cities and metropolitan areas ranked greensboro high point tops in the state and 20th in the southeast last year up from 31st in 2005 it passed charlotte gastonia concord which slipped from 18th in the southeast in 2005 to 22nd raleigh cary came in 28th in the southeast in the latest ranking
4543657 the circumstances surrounding his death are not considered suspicious and the matter has now been referred to the coroner
4543658 police would like to thank the community for their assistance in this matter
4543659 dengue is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito and when a person with dengue arrives in another country local mosquitoes that bite him or her can transmit the illness to others
4543660 omagh 98 will always be remembered for the horrific loss of innocent life and the terrible suffering caused to so many but the way that its people responded to that tragedy will also mark omagh 98 as a monument to the triumph of hope over despair
4543661 as we continue to build a peaceful and a better future the omagh bombing remains an indelible stain on our history that will never be forgotten
4543662 our thoughts and prayers are with those who were killed and injured and all of those who still grieve for their loss and who continue to search for justice
4543663 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4543664 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4543665 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4543666 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4543667 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4543668 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4543669 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4543670 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4543671 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4543672 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4543673 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4543674 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4543675 she is the best athlete in the world so i dont feel a pity being overtaken by her
4543676 it was the right place to break the world record and i had hoped i would but it was not so next year i am sure ill do it

4543717 our approach is unique in the world no one else has yet developed customized immunotherapy using the virus from individual patients
4543718 this experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment but were hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future
4543719 at this stage we have shown that the technique doesnt cause side effects or an undesirable auto immune response
4543720 health canada has approved a multicentre clinical trial across the country that will let us further assess the techniques effectiveness at controlling hiv reproduction were hoping that the fda in the united states will also give us the go ahead soon so that our pharmaceutical partner argos therapeutics can begin testing in the united states
4543721 many people still assume that parenting ends when a child turns 18 but in our culture today there is a longer extension of adolescence
4543722 everything is not lost if you are the parent of a college student and trying to do a better job
4543723 if you are open and ready to listen to what they have to say that will help you build a stronger relationship
4543724 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
4543725 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
4543726 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature
4543727 our work has the potential to result in new therapeutic drugs for a broad range of diseases this work also provides an exciting example of the increased complexity with which we are engineering biological systems to address global societal challenges
4543728 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
4543729 they didnt compensate for the lower calorie mushroom meal by eating more food later in the day
4543730 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
4543731 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
4543732 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
4543733 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
4543734 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
4543735 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful
4543736 reconstructing these frescoes is incredibly complex given the condition of the fragments and the sheer number of fragments
4543737 the computer takes over the laborious parts of the process while leaving the important intuitive decisions to the humans
4543738 a system for high volume acquisition and matching of fresco fragments reassembling theran wall paintings
4543739 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4543740 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
4543741 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area

4543991 this is not the case as any software has access to the same set of os apis and can therefore expose the same set of os functionality as ie
4543992 new clean electric technology that will take 10 years to perfect
4543993 to start with the u s government should lead the way by requiring that a growing percentage of new cars be built with dual fuel capability these dual fuel cars would have both an electric engine and an auxiliary gasoline engine to augment it
4543994 a dryer outlet will give most of a charge in an hour or a full charge in less than 3 hours with a 110 volt outlet its still easily charged overnight with a 200 amp off board charger the tango can be charged to 80 in about 10 minutes
4543995 our main objective would be to through intelligence find out about a plot before it ever got to a stage where a nuclear device or a dirty bomb was coming our way
4543996 this provides for our defense after a plot has already been launched and a device is on its way
4543997 someone has thought up a movie plot in their head of bad guys driving trucks into new york city
4543998 while im sure there are some scenarios in which this makes sense spending for security based on movie plots is only effective if you guess the plot correctly
4543999 the presence of a video camera even if its a fake one is very often enough to change peoples behavior

4544001 the quality of license plate images is so easily degraded that complete accuracy is unlikely

4544025 the new british body will see oxford and cambridge universities host a group of scholars to lead the debate on key british muslim issues such as womens rights and responsibilities and loyalty to the host country britain
4544026 i believe that there is now sufficient evidence to demonstrate that british officials outsourced the torture of british nationals to a pakistani intelligence agency
4544027 we need to encourage and create safe places for sensible debate around issues that extremists can seek to exploit and make sure that young british muslims recognise their faith teaches shared citizenship values
4544028 terrorists were misusing the name of islam and the media was maligning the religion

4544072 its like were sending the message to kids that deadlines dont matter studying is optional and no matter how little you do youre still going to pass all your classes anyway
4544073 talk about elevating standards and holding high expectations for kids but were telling the kids that whether they do the work or not is irrelevant
4544074 babying the rules so that students have almost unlimited chances to pass thats unreal
4544075 in the real world you dont get a whole lot of chances or other ways to make something up
4544076 for a very long time its been clear that there was a security vacuum in the south caucasus
4544077 its a lesson for ukraine ukraine is the largest post soviet country after russia and one that shares a long border with the european union it cant be left in a similar vacuum
4544078 what we can see in this overreaction is that there is a risk for ukraine and of course ukraine has a frozen conflict on its own border
4544079 we want to avoid a security vacuum that will be prone to a defrosting of such a frozen conflict
4544080 european leaders must now realize that the south ossetia conflict has opened such a vacuum throughout the entire area that moscow sometimes calls its near abroad we welcome the eus effort led by france and supported by germany and others to be more visible as an actor in the region
4544081 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4544082 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4544083 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4544084 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4544085 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4544086 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4544087 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4544094 when we started spore we were thinking about how wed make an engine that had the possibility of expansion so yes well add to the experience
4544095 i think however we have a very cool opportunity to take spore in a few different directions too the editors are so cool and fun that we want to advance those as well as the gameplay that we put into the core game
4544096 i immediately began looking at retail spaces in the city to get an idea of what was possible
4544097 i played a ton of arcade games as a kid thanks to generous parents and arcade games conveniently located any place we went
4544098 i was hooked from the very start and also have fond memories of legend of kage followed by black tiger a bit later on
4544099 arcade gaming died out in the u s for many reasons but i dont think any of them are the reasons most people think about
4544100 the number one reason it died here is because of our coinage system the japanese coin system is coincidentally perfectly made for arcade gaming with 50 yen and 100 yen denominations 50 cents 1 dollar
4544101 ultimately i dont think its a matter of japanese people being any more into gaming than americans
4544102 arcades have been successfully marketed in japan and adapted through an era of change the u s operators just gave up
4544103 japan is a culture built around easy transportation in metro areas and there is always an arcade close by if youre in the city
4544104 it was dirty didnt always smell great and generally looked like it was about to fall apart however this was the kind of place you could go and make life long friends and the arcade machines were always in perfect shape the regulars diligently attended almost every day myself included when i lived there in 2005
4544105 i want to bring back that feature which is long lost in most of the arcades still standing in the u s today
4544106 the feeling that the other people in the room actually play video games and enjoy them as much as you do

4544108 their sic is a beautiful irony that the nostalgic cabaret that is my bloody valentine are throwing at people in 2008 gets critical acclaim in the easily pleased uk press with mbv still playing the exact same set they did 20 years ago

4544151 either kratovil has a short term memory or he is intentionally misleading the voters in the first district

4544157 what happened to get us to this place and what is to be done to get us out of it
4544158 there are only a few bad eggs and once they are weeded out things will return to normal
4544159 the government politicians police army church blacks indians creoles syrians youth drugs deportees are to blame

4544161 the commitment by pg amp e is a wake up call for congress to act on extending the itc when it returns from recess
4544162 we feel that acts like this are exactly what is needed to light the fire under the feet of our federal policy makers
4544163 is racing to sign big deals even at the eventual expense of margins ahead of lower cost suppliers
4544164 when youre in an airplane you dont want your fuel to start solidifying
4544165 so we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem
4544166 were looking for something that is so correct in its performance that it can be interchanged with petroleum based kerosene
4544167 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling

4544189 you guys to leave now youve been sitting for almost three hours with no extra order for gods sake
4544190 government should care for those who cant care for themselves
4544191 all right for blacks and whites to date each other
4544192 werden wir mitte oktober anhand der dann verf gbaren daten berpr fen
4544193 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4544194 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4544195 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4544196 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4544197 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4544198 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4544199 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4544200 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4544201 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4544202 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4544203 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4544204 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4544205 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4544206 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4544207 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4544208 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4544209 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4544210 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4544211 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4544212 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4544213 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4544214 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4544215 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4544216 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4544217 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4544218 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4544219 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4544220 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4544221 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4544222 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4544223 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4544224 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4544225 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4544226 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4544227 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4544228 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4544229 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4544230 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4544231 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4544232 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4544233 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4544234 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4544235 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4544236 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4544237 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4544238 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4544239 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4544240 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4544241 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4544242 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4544243 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4544244 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4544245 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4544246 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4544247 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4544248 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4544249 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4544250 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4544251 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4544252 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4544253 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4544254 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4544255 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4544256 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4544257 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4544258 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4544259 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4544260 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4544261 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4544262 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4544263 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4544264 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4544265 knocks an extra 15 off orders over 150 receive free shipping otherwise shipping adds 7 the
4544266 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4544267 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4544268 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4544269 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on the road pretty much but they did hold me for some time
4544270 i guess i let my nerves get the best of me
4544271 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4544272 this is a planning took where all things are going
4544273 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4544274 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4544275 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4544276 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4544277 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4544278 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4544279 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4544280 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4544281 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4544282 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4544283 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4544284 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4544285 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4544286 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4544287 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4544288 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4544289 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4544290 hello ladies and gentleman i will be your server would you also like the children menu
4544291 i am so sorry people always do the same to me and now i actually did it to someone else
4544292 i just got 2 great tickets returned for the first show today interested
4544293 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4544294 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4544295 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4544296 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4544297 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4544298 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4544299 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4544300 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4544301 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

4544312 of course every pet owner thinks their pets are the coolest but heres my entry
4544313 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4544314 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life

4544319 many people consider those celebrities completely separated from the world in which they live
4544320 there are times when i feel 40 and i feel like theres a piano on my back and i cant lift my arms up out of the pool and there are times when i feel like im 20 and just flying through the water
4544321 shes hired some pretty high powered consultants to advise her and put it all together the website will be a registry like for a bridal or shower registry where low income women list things they need for their babies more well off people will then go on and buy stuff for the children

4544323 im at that age where biologically it calls me a lot

4544327 francis stated that he planned on exposing how exactly mr wynn deceives his high end customers with reckless disregard for the truth
4544328 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
4544329 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
4544330 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
4544331 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
4544332 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4544333 cadence is a disciplined buyer and will only pursue transactions that make sound financial sense for our shareholders
4544334 mentor graphics failure to engage in substantive discussions on our all cash premium proposal prevented us from confirming for our financing sources the significant synergies associated with this transaction
4544335 led us to conclude that financing terms for the transaction are no longer attractive for our shareholders
4544336 he grabbed me with both hands around my shoulders and he threw me
4544337 the next thing i knew the mayor was at the door
4544338 he was cursing and telling us to get off his property
4544339 the next thing i know he shoved det white into me
4544340 i stood there for a moment because i couldnt believe it
4544341 youre a black woman you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4544342 weve been very careful not to litigate this matter in the press
4544343 we feel we have some sign that he clearly was not in duress
4544344 set up or an opportunity to harass the mayor and his family
4544345 they create a good atmosphere its only in the last few years weve seen things like this
4544346 some of them are wearing a bit too little maybe but i can accept it
4544347 i think were quite open now this sort of thing is normal now on tv
4544348 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
4544349 this picture solves an old family mystery my great grandfather who fought on the side of great britain in the boer war often told a story
4544350 without minimizing obamas impressive political campaign and personal talents his decisive support came from people vehemently opposed to the war
4544351 yes that is very true most of the democratic party voters and activists are opposed to the disastrous iraq war you dont win your partys nomination by pisssing off the activist base she lost the nomination the minute moveon org decided to back obama
4544352 the web site will be a registry like for a bridal or shower registry where low income women list things they need for their babies

4544364 ive seen races like bolts before in my career said patton

4544366 im not going to get excited about a quarterfinal race im not going to worry about other people time and time again at the olympic games you see somebody who upstages everybody
4544367 we made a lot more changes this afternoon and with the new setting i felt really good on the bike my lap time is not too bad but i think we can improve on that we have the power and i need to work on my rhythm a bit one of the best things today is that i am nearly at 100 after the injury my condition is great and this weekend i want to give the team something good because after recent races they really need it
4544368 the first thing i have to say is that its great to have the original spec loris back in the garage
4544369 his arm is still causing him some pain and it doesnt look too good but it is at a level now where it isnt restricting his riding and he is able to concentrate on the bike and his own performance being in the top three today is a great encouragement for the team and tremendous personal boost for loris after all the pain of the recent grands prix
4544370 what pacific dunes has going for it is that its totally back to nature
4544371 there are no homes there are no roads there are some truly gigantic dunes that occupy holes various routing quirks that are a lot of fun that you dont see elsewhere back to back par 3s four par 3s on the back nine alone and youve got more ocean views there than you do at pebble beach
4544372 chambers bay is a true collaboration of the rtjii team
4544373 the course is a strategic masterpiece with wild elevation changes split fairways enormous dunes tattered edge bunkers and stunning scenery we cant wait for the 2015 open

4544395 we discussed whether any changes could be made to the restrictions at the last quarterly review meeting attended by oswestry borough council the police and our traffic engineers
4544396 at this review it was deemed inappropriate to change the restrictions
4544397 like z it describes all structures in space and time with a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions
4544398 you still have all the download features and all the filtering and faffing as seen before so
4544399 the google external keyword tool displays actual search volumes by geo local if you prefer
4544400 federated search com bines search results retrieved from multiple search engines into a single interweaved set of results
4544401 federated search is a starting point for research a shotgun approach each federated search engine is different ranks results indifferent ways and presents results in different ways
4544402 i believe we know from a technical standpoint how to scale federated search to hundreds or possibly thousands of sources we know how to do that
4544403 as you have more and more sources it does not make sense to search every source for every query we want to use past history and profiles to say for starters these 20 sources are most likely to return good information
4544404 we spend a significant amount of effort to get it as close to being right aspossible for scitopia where we uses deep web technologies search which provides for alerts sent to users weekly
4544405 we want to incorporate some of our relevance ranking into a cluster so that when you look at the results for a cluster you see the results in ranked order i want to see if we can display clusters in terms of relevance to the users query
4544406 clearly the area will require significant investment trial and error expert input and user patience
4544407 for the end user little training is needed to understand how the system works
4544408 the strength of search technology is that users know how to search the web so they need little training to get started once a single search box is presented to them
4544409 employees do not wish to learn a licensed products tool to retrieve information from its contents they want a single search interface with familiar options to search and retrieve information with the least amount of effort possible
4544410 a design goal was set that no training or support would be necessary for employees to use the upgraded search solution
4544411 we have a compre hensive and user friendly search solution that spans our external licensed information internal managed informa tion and internet information sources

4544493 c stato un calo di reati in questi ultimi mesi
4544494 il calo dovuto a diversi fattori tra i quali la fine delleffetto dovuto allindulto
4544495 e certamente anche per una pi efficace azione delle forze dellordine
4544496 ma ancora presto per fare i bilanci li faremo a fine anno

4544500 bei den planungen haben die uns genauso viele steine in den weg gelegt wie die cdu da gab es kaum unterschiede
4544501 bestimmte medien versuchen von beginn an die aktion in eine kriminelle ecke zu stellen es werden dinge behauptet die einfach nicht stimmen

4544693 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way

4544704 my wife was born in china and she tells me that it is the cultural norm for parents to count the year a child is born as 1 year and then the babys first day as a year so if a baby is 2 days old they would call her 2 years old

4544708 inherently and unacceptably anti russian says strobe talbott who served as deputy secretary of state during the clinton administration
4544709 they regard it as unacceptable for an independent state on their borders to want to integrate with western european international institutions including nato including the e u
4544710 now that i would suggest is highly problematic and certainly not something that any other country should accept but moreover it calls into question the premise of u s policy towards russia going back at least three administrations george herbert walker bush bill clinton and the current president
4544711 there are more than nuances of differences among all three of those administration and all three of those presidents but all three of them have been committed to the proposition that it is in russias interest and it is in the worlds interest for russia to rejoin europe to join international institutions and by the way to partner and maybe someday even be more than just a partner with nato
4544712 while the two candidates for that office are exaggerating the differences between them and while the press is exaggerating the differences between them for perfectly legitimate and understandable reasons i dont think there is that much difference between them on this question and its going to be a huge challenge for the next administration
4544713 the united states and our allies stand with the people of georgia and their democratically elected government

4544715 some americans listening today may wonder why events taking place in a small country halfway around the world matter to the united states
4544716 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgia has become a courageous democracy its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy

4544718 news reports revealed yesterday that turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdo an assured turkish cypriot officials especially the opposition during a visit to the north last month that g zelyurt would never be returned to greek cypriot control
4544719 as cypriot leaders are readying for comprehensive negotiations set for next month the town of g zelyurt in northwest cyprus will not be on the table as a bargaining chip for the turkish side

4544724 these two countries have so far objected because of the constitutional processes
4544725 who is a turkish cypriot or a turk of cyprus
4544726 as i heard the cultural part of the history of cyprus belonging to the greek cypriot community is completely protected the greek cypriots recorded their cultural history in various works and prepared them for the usage of the coming generations on the other hand the turkish cypriots have not even thought of this subject they also neglected every period of the history of cyprus where is a history of literature where is a history of administration even their general history was written in a simple text book the only article written up to now about our cultural history is the short article about the history of the lycee which was published last year in the journal of the lycee we need an article immediately about the development of our elementary schools which are the cradle of our culture
4544727 a short geography and a short history of cyprus for the schools

4544730 our culture and art journals among the dusty pages of history
4544731 those newspapers which left their imprints in the turkish cypriot press
4544732 the importance of cultural and artistic development in search of identity
4544733 we have not come here to give a prescription to the turkish cypriot art and culture
4544734 the cultural identity of the turkish cypriots is different from ours
4544735 i am searching for my soul in the mediterranean culture
4544736 maybe it would be more appropriate if we have called the name of this conference as
4544737 the importance of the identity of the turks living in cyprus its necessity from the geographical historical national religious and political point of view
4544738 we in other words the turkish cypriots of today are not as the greek cypriots allege the remnants of the invaders but the real owners of the island the turkish cypriots are the oldest people of the island with their history and culture and as a national people they are different from the greek cypriot people and have all the rights that the greek cypriots have
4544739 the history of the turkish cypriots first book the turkish component of the turkish cypriot identity
4544740 the turkish cypriots like horse and sword in other words they still keep their t rkmenish characteristics brought all along through the centuries
4544741 those left or right wing intellectuals who come to cyprus from turkey and get fond of the so called democracy here have to learn first of all the identity of the turkish cypriots and the history of this country
4544742 to support the cypriot identity is in fact being conservative and reactionary although it has an appearance of being progressive
4544743 the main problem is to possess first our own cypriot identity and to make this cypriot identity universal in a dynamic structure as the class struggle intensifies the class character of this identity too will show itself
4544744 the formation of the turkish cypriot leadership 1900 1942 the process of becoming a national community out of a religious community

4544757 the principal conduit between britain and the candidate obama has been lord mark malloch brown the junior foreign minister whom obama came to admire when he was deputy secretary general of the united nations
4544758 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4544759 we think that the russians never actually imposed a blockade rather what happened was that commercial ships didnt go into the port simply because the russians were there not because they were being prevented from coming in

4544764 the play is more an intercultural voyage than a story it is about sharing and communications an acceptance of each other such as they are
4544765 today i have to say sorry to all of the dpp members and supporters i let everyone down caused you humiliation and failed to meet your expectations my acts have caused irreparable damage to the party
4544766 i love the dpp deeply and am proud of being a dpp member to express my deepest regrets to all dpp members and supporters i announce my withdrawal from the dpp immediately my wife wu shu jen is also withdrawing from the party
4544767 i am not greedy for money i made a serious mistake i dont expect the public to forgive me but i will take responsibility for what i did although i am no longer a dpp member i am willing to accept an investigation by the partys integrity committee
4544768 the money was not all wired in january 2007 the money was there before 2007 and so it had nothing to do with the png scandal
4544769 in regard to chen and his wifes decision to withdraw from the party and his desire to shoulder responsibility for his actions as well as to undergo an investigation by the partys anti corruption committee we respect his decision and accept it
4544770 we will give the public a dpp that is renewed and worthy of expectations
4544771 anti corruption and local values are the dpps only assets we are willing to start over and face these difficulties and continue to be an opposition to the kmt government and protect taiwans sovereignty and democracy
4544772 in the investigation of chens case we will not be biased or cover anything up the dpp will support the courts and we stress that chen has the right and must offer the public a clearer explanation
4544773 its crucial for the judiciary to find out where the money was from and how it was used
4544774 the truth should be determined by the judiciary rather than by the persons involved
4544775 it is quite a surprise to find so large a patch of algal reefs that is relatively undisturbed by human activities
4544776 talks are under way and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4544777 my belief is that the president does not intend to leave the country there is no question of him leaving pakistan
4544778 it becomes very unimportant for me to comment on these reports i have been hearing all this for the past many months
4544779 musharraf will neither face impeachment nor be prosecuted we expect a major development in the next 48 hours
4544780 last night we lost to former colonial power japan and today we lost to the communist bandits
4544781 they should all go jump in the sea this is the end for the taiwan team
4544782 but i didnt really expect it to happen right here right now
4544783 our approach this year is based on the principles of pragmatism and flexibility
4544784 our approach this year is based on the principles of pragmatism and flexibility to meet the expectations of the public
4544785 the fundamental rights of the 23 million people of the republic of china taiwan to participate meaningfully in the activities of the united nations specialized agencies
4544786 the ministry urges china to understand the expectations and will of the 23 million people of taiwan and calls on beijing to respond with goodwill and flexibility
4544787 china claims it wants to win the hearts and minds of the taiwanese people what could be a better way than to stop obstructing our un bid
4544788 because the name will not become an issue until the international community has reached a consensus welcoming taiwan into the fold
4544789 considering all the three factors the un proposal should be realistic and flexible
4544790 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries
4544791 i think we are in a war against islamic extremism and i think that war is worldwide
4544792 if we dont even insist on our name then we cant be considered a country and if thats the case then we dont need foreign relations
4544793 if we dont even insist on our name then we cant be considered a country and if thats the case then we dont need foreign relations
4544794 this is why the caa has not approved the carriers request to halt the service
4544795 instead of giving the money to the social welfare groups that requested it local governments often use the money for their own construction projects
4544796 the government has outsourced social welfare programs or promised financial aid to social welfare groups across the country however the government has either delayed payments or simply owes the money
4544797 however instead of giving the money to the social welfare groups that requested it local governments often use the money for their own construction projects
4544798 as far as i know the taichung county government already owes more than nt 10 million us 318 000 to social welfare groups some payments have been delayed for two to three years already
4544799 central or local governments quite often delay payments to social welfare groups for outsourced projects and sometimes they even try to bargain
4544800 of course the government is able to keep promising more social welfare because its often the social workers from social welfare groups that have to put their own money into executing the governments projects
4544801 as another school year approaches we continue to see the costs of higher education increase
4544802 this law will decrease costs and increase opportunities for all students
4544803 when the concentration of air pollutants rises it induces allergic reactions among some children
4544804 theyre trying to whitewash their human rights record and present a pretty picture to the world when in fact behind the facade is an ugly reality and the situation in tibet is as bad as its been in a very long time
4544805 i assume they think the kids were very natural looking and nice
4544806 the near collision was the result of a chain of events
4544807 the controller later said that because he was busy trying to find a plane that had disappeared off his radar screen and since he was the only person tracking both incidents his hands were tied
4544808 making a decision based solely on visual data is against protocol the pilot later claimed that he had seen a shadow above him which was why he descended however later analysis confirmed that there was no object near his plane he should have followed tcas advice and gradually descended
4544809 in many air accidents we found that those passengers who were injured almost always did not have their seat belts on whereas those who wore seatbelts had a much better chance of coming out uninjured
4544810 we received the request late july and have asked related units to help with the process
4544811 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4544812 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4544813 this is the first known use of cluster munitions since 2006 during israels war with hezbollah in lebanon
4544814 hello this is congresswoman shelley moore capito and i am privileged to represent the second congressional district in the great energy producing state of west virginia
4544815 at a time when gasoline prices have hovered around 4 00 per gallon its long past time that we had a serious debate about our nations energy policy
4544816 yet congressional leadership sent the house on a five week recess without holding a real debate or a vote on any comprehensive energy bill
4544817 our challenges deserve pragmatic consensus building but what we have is deadlock inaction wont solve our energy challenges and neither will a lengthy congressional recess
4544818 its going to take an all of the above approach that seeks out any and all viable energy resources that means traditional resources like oil natural gas and coal but also renewable resources like wind and solar energy technology
4544819 free unimpeded access for hunting fishing snowmobiling and other traditional uses is an integral part of maines heritage
4544820 yet increasingly lands that have been available for generations to pursue these activities have been posted off limits to the public as a member of the congressional sportsmens caucus a life long sportsman and gun owner who values maines traditions i am greatly concerned about this disturbing trend i have introduced legislation specifically aimed at ensuring that future generations will have the same opportunities for outdoor recreation that maine people have enjoyed for centuries
4544821 i grew up enjoying the maine outdoors and diana and i raised our family enjoying the maine outdoors
4544822 in february we welcomed our first grandchild charles allen creswell named for his great grandfather who introduced me to the maine outdoors the traditional use protection act is my way of helping to ensure that charlie and all maine children will be able to hunt fish snowmobile and enjoy all of the outdoor recreation pursuits that make maine such a special place to live and raise a family
4544823 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4544824 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4544825 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4544826 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4544827 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4544828 we want america to be independent when it comes to energy what we have been asking now for 2 months is a vote to increase our energy supply we believe in wind hydro solar and other alternatives but we need to make increased supply a priority and we want that supply to come from this country
4544829 our message is this we want an all of the above energy plan we know the pathway in the 21 st century is conservation its new technologies its more nuclear power but in the midst of expanding those we must give access to the vast oil reserves right here in the unites states
4544830 not only should we drill but we also believe that it is central that we develop new alternatives and new technologies and that we move to more conservation
4544831 there is a lot of instability in the rest of the world and when we depend on the rest of the world for 70 percent of our oil we are at their mercy we need to be independent and we should drill off of our shores but this congress will not let this happen its insanity
4544832 one of the things congress is supposed to do is to pass appropriations bill to fund the government usually by this time of the year most of that work has been completed but this year not only have we not addressed energy we have only passed one appropriations bill the speaker has blocked consideration of appropriations bills because they want to block an amendment on off shore drilling shes held up the entire appropriations process to avoid this amendment but we have been busy weve considered and passed national passport month manufactured housing week national student day country music month watermelon month and apple month those are the priorities unfortunately no time for spending bills no time for energy
4544833 victory in georgia now gives russia the edge in the struggle over access to the caspians 35 billion barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of gas
4544834 recognition of exceptional service rendered the country community and mankind
4544835 senator webb made a vow to create a new gi bill for the 21st century he kept that promise and it is my honor and privilege to present the vfw gold medal and citation to senator webb for his efforts
4544836 credit is due to senator webb for building the ship and successfully steering it for almost 19 months to success
4544837 the vfw had been pushing for a new gi bill for 10 years
4544838 we had called written testified and met with every member and staffer we were greeted with sympathetic ears but what we needed was a champion in the corner of americas newest greatest generation we needed someone who could reason and negotiate across party lines like a gentleman yet push through obstacles with bulldog tenacity that someone was jim webb
4544839 in early 06 we began with the simple concept that those who have been serving since 9 11 should have the same opportunity for a first class educational future as those who served during world war ii today we can celebrate the achievement of that goal
4544840 i am honored to receive this award from the vfw a group that was integral to this bills success the collaboration and support of the vfw during the past year and a half were very much a key to its passage
4544841 i know that those who will assemble at the vfw convention next week can attest that there are no politics here this is about properly honoring service to country and taking care of the people who have taken care of us
4544842 his literary work has brought critical acclaim and through his honest and forthright reporting his outspoken criticism of revisionist history and his defense of the facts regarding vietnam veterans
4544843 members of our armed forces traveling on official orders should not have to bear any cost whatsoever associated with that official travel

4544855 people are starting to look at mccain and see how hes a real guy with real answers
4544856 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what theyre preaching
4544857 i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
4544858 i am happy to see madisons business community responding to the challenges they have faced over the past few years and taking proactive steps to expand current businesses and attract new industries as well with an influx of federal dollars into the project hopefully the laics goals will quickly come to fruition
4544859 we are going to need congressional action to make sure that people can get reasonably priced cable television
4544860 left alone prices will continue to rise and families are going to be priced out of cable television
4544861 comcast has decided to remove up to 13 channels from its analog cable packages without any reduction in the price customers pay in vermont we all know that when you get less for the same price it is a price increase
4544862 while oil fields could regularly become battlefields energy independence must top our national priority list in an increasingly violent anti western international culture counter to this harsh reality s congressional delegation continues to impede efforts toward american energy security
4544863 though we support the development of new alternative home based energy sources and mindful measured consumption of natural resources it is blind folly for rep peter welch sen bernie

4544866 months of political deadlock have finally come to an end
4544867 the alliance has made it certain prachanda will become prime minister as theyll easily get the votes needed for a simple majority

4544871 ching left on aug 12 and will return on aug 17 she will coordinate with swiss law enforcement officers while the supreme prosecutors office special investigation panel sip will continue to investigate whether chen is involved in money laundering
4544872 i wanted to just kick the tv when i watched chen press conference
4544873 these people always say that they love taiwan but in fact theyre doing shameful things like this
4544874 chen may be penalized with a maximum fine of nt 300 000 us 9 550 for each untruthful declaration of property he made
4544875 former president chen mentioned during thursdays press conference that he made false declarations about his campaign funds and we are very concerned about it
4544876 we therefore decided to set up a special task force of nine cec members to look into whether chen violated any law under the commissions jurisdiction
4544877 chen can still be held responsible since his false declarations were made when the clauses were valid
4544878 i visited the shrine because i hope those who contributed their lives in the past wars would rest in peace
4544879 we pledge to lead the world as a peaceful and harmonious country and to work proactively toward establishing permanent world peace
4544880 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4544881 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region
4544882 we will make the reconstruction of public service facilities such as schools and hospitals our priority and turn them into extremely safe and solid structures that the public can feel reassured about
4544883 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4544884 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4544885 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
4544886 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4544887 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4544888 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4544889 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4544890 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4544891 i have no indication that russias invasion of georgia at all influenced the negotiations but who knows you can draw your own conclusions
4544892 however the european missile defense is not aimed at countering russias missile arsenal but rather at emerging threats such as iran
4544893 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4544894 mend concluded a successful rescue of the two german hostages and staff of julius berger from inside the heavily fortified hideout of the group that kidnapped them
4544895 lets hope the suspicion is unfounded that fascism is resurfacing in our country under another guise
4544896 the catholic world agrees with the security measures adopted by the government and approved by parliament

4544904 obviously theres considerable planning going on with the americans as to what the future construct in iraq is going to look like
4544905 the americans quite sensibly want the force reductions to be such that they can maintain the gains theyve made and obviously we will be in discussion with them military to military as to how we take that planning forward

4544921 shes unique shes afflicted with crippling depression the elephant sanctuary is the right choice
4544922 why would we want her last years to be in a drive through zoo in mexico when she could have 300 acres 120 hectares in the lush tennessee countryside
4544923 if we stripped everything away and say what is in the best interest of jenny the sanctuary would win hands down
4544924 but then you have to add in all the politics
4544925 i like keeping these elephants within the aza where they meet our standards
4544926 space is just a catchphrase its what you do with that space
4544927 you just never know whats going to happen to them down in mexico
4544928 i hope they are going to get someone to replace her i just cannot imagine a zoo without an elephant just sit here and watch them they are magnificent creatures
4544929 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
4544930 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
4544931 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
4544932 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
4544933 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
4544934 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
4544935 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
4544936 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
4544937 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
4544938 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war
4544939 longer term we would not be surprised to see gold double
4544940 we would be aggressive buyers at current levels expecting gold to work higher through 2009 10
4544941 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4544942 the purpose is mainly to let people know that there is something going on here which is the dirty little secrets that pretty much most people dont know about
4544943 when we talk about tourism and people coming over to visit los angeles theyre not going to see the nasty parts
4544944 the juxtaposition of an oil refinery and a neighborhood was the biggest eye opener for me
4544945 just knowing that their backyard was literally an oil refinery its inspiring and awing at the same time
4544946 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct which is the most important message as we strive to further improve our green credentials
4544947 she told the court and the psychologist that she had heard voices threatening the children and she wanted to protect them she killed them because she believed she was protecting them from these evil powers
4544948 we will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4544949 the paper highlights a real dilemma we have today in diabetes treatment
4544950 we have drugs that lower glucose but we seem to run into problems over time with improving outcomes particularly cardiovascular outcomes a big question is whether it is due to the disease or the drugs increasing cardiovascular risk
4544951 that there is some increased risk with this combination that is the most widely used diabetes treatment of two drugs that are cheap and generic

4544954 there is absolutely no evidence that the kinder surprise eggs as a combination of toy and foodstuff are dangerous
4544955 sending min ju here was not an ideal but an inevitable choice
4544956 in our country college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent of a persons future its a sad reality but you have to acknowledge it otherwise you hurt your childrens future
4544957 i asked myself what i was doing in a place like this when all my friends were having a good time in college but i consider a year in this place as an investment for a better future
4544958 but we dont use much cosmetics we dont dye our hair we dont wear conspicuous clothes
4544959 the students come under tremendous pressure when the exam date approaches and their score doesnt improve girls weep during counseling and boys run away and dont return
4544960 i may shed tears of sadness today but tomorrow i will shed tears of happiness
4544961 think about the sacrifices your parents make to send you here
4544962 i was crying quietly its a historic loss its the first time a first class team has gone down to china and its the first time the two teams have met in the olympics
4544963 today we looked bad we are better than this the strategy seemed to be a bit off
4544964 obviously we have to play better simply put we have to win more games against stronger opposition
4544965 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4544966 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4544967 i dont agree with the judges but i have to respect their decision and learn from this
4544968 people are just getting sick and tried of getting ripped off by large corporations whether its oil companies credit card companies or the local cable company
4544969 never said were going to slowly wipe those channels out
4544970 in vermont we all know that when you get less for the same price it is a price increase
4544971 we will continue to offer analog cable service after the federally mandated digital broadcast transition in february of next year
4544972 people are just getting sick and tried of getting ripped off by large corporations whether its oil companies credit card companies or the local cable company
4544973 i believe that comcast is being unfair to consumers in vermont who see as i do the number of channels in their analog cable packages going down without a reduction in price as a rate hike when people pay the same amount of money to receive less service that is a rate hike plain and simple
4544974 will allow our network to deliver hd and other enhancements to the majority of our customers who have signed up for digital cable service
4544975 comcast has decided to remove up to 13 channels from its analog cable packages without any reduction in the price customers pay in vermont we all know that when you get less for the same price it is a price increase
4544976 so much for sen john mccain s claim that obama votes to the left of sanders
4544977 quite clearly the public is very interested but would a public hearing with all the attendant costs and legal arguments as to jurisdiction be in the public interest that is something i have to wrestle with
4544978 we felt it was in the best interest of all involved
4544979 i have some skepticism with the overweight obesity is healthy study for one thing and i have asked the
4544980 we havent won a medal in 48 years ive been anticipating this match since the athens olympics
4544981 for us to get the finals we feel like weve already done really well
4544982 in the first half we didnt create a lot of chances
4544983 our focus was on defense we had many difficulties and we want to solve these problems in training especially in attack we had 10 opportunities and two goals
4544984 if we continue with these difficult victories it doesnt matter the important thing is if we win the gold medal
4544985 we tried low pressure because we had to keep the team together
4544986 i thought we did an excellent job until the first goal the only thing im disappointed in was the way we let in the two goals the first was an easy ball in our own half and the second was a big mistake by our defender
4544987 i dearly hope to hold on to that gold medal position
4544988 i hope it will be sweet and easy but knowing the olympics it wont
4544989 with the position i was in i had to make a decision
4544990 i started match racing with the french boat when i saw i would not make the top five
4544991 the referee didnt allow us to serve to the back of the court only the front this made it very difficult for us because we have never encountered such a situation before so we couldnt understand what was going on
4544992 no matter what the event is i want to win but it didnt happen
4544993 i didnt know i had as little time as i did i didnt even have time to go into the ready room
4544994 i went from the ceremony straight into putting my parka on and goggles cap and go it was about two minutes i knew it was tight but not that tight
4544995 it just kind of flowed it just happened it felt great i just kept it strong and powered to the end
4544996 we came back and we showed the usa is really strong we deserved the top two medals and we showed the world we can come back no matter what
4544997 im still fighting for that medal count with him he has four so i have a few more to go
4544998 to je pa nekaj kar bi v pomanj ani varianti lahko imeli tudi pri nas
4544999 as i told you after my first match im just looking to find my rhythm which i found tonight
4545000 i was happy to not spend too much time on the court
4545001 my arm gets really tired and i cant practice as much
4545002 i played some balls deep into the corners and down the middle and she didnt have a chance to step up and play her game
4545003 i played a horrible service game the next one and somehow got through it
4545004 i felt like i was on the verge of doing a lot of the right things tonight
4545005 when you can take someones best and fight them off and fight them off and fight them off and fight them off and finally three hours later get the win its a good feeling
4545006 he is an affectionate guy but he takes his work very seriously and in training he is definitely a bit harder with us
4545007 he just wants the players to be dedicated though he doesnt want people playing around during the time we are meant to be working hard i think we have everything necessary to win the premier league again and also the champions league
4545008 we have some big games coming up one of those is on saturday at sunderland so we must not play like this again
4545009 we have the quality in our team we just need to step up now and look forward to sunderland we will not play as badly as that again we must improve and we will improve
4545010 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4545011 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4545012 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4545013 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4545014 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4545015 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4545016 umpires tend to be intimidated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4545017 never seen anything like this in my career for software
4545018 this medal is dedicated to my motherland and to the people but also to my dear mother who had passed away recently

4545025 from its dismal condition 10 years ago indonesia has transformed today into a dynamic nation full of hope
4545026 however despite all this our nation continues to be impacted by a number of serious trials the price of oil has reached the highest level in history the price of food all over the world has drastically soared
4545027 the budget for education has risen to almost double from 78 5 trillion rupiah in 2005 to 154 2 trillion in 2008
4545028 this realistic figure is indeed important for the next presidential election the government will easily reach the growth forecast and yudhoyono will tell people that he has managed to achieve what he promised
4545029 in the midst of the global oil and food price crisis
4545030 it was no surprise that investors tended to pocket their gains whenever the market staged a rebound
4545031 the bourse needs some time to consolidate before returning to an upswing trend
4545032 should have no effect on our ability to pursue them in the itc which is where we are focusing our efforts and expect to see results
4545033 we think taiwan will underperform relative to the rest of the region as the global slowdown unfolds
4545034 the us dollar is rebounding because the outlook for the rest of the world is basically being downgraded
4545035 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything
4545036 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings
4545037 it will take some time for the economy to turn around but we are confident in the long term fundamentals and underlying strength of our economy to get us through this period
4545038 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july

4545173 not answering the question hes buying time to give an appropriate innocent response they werent asking how great is your wife they were asking about the accuracy of the story

4545181 the current standard of care in allograft stem cell mobilization involving g csf requires donors to undergo treatment over a period of several days it is also associated with established risks such as bone pain and there have always been theoretical concerns that it could stimulate bone marrow abnormalities clearly a treatment that can reduce time to collection and also reduce risks associated with the use of g csf would represent a major advance for both donors and the patients who need blood stem cell transplants in the years ahead
4545182 these results indicate that hspc mobilization with plerixafor a direct antagonist of the sdf 1 cxcr interaction can safely and effectively mobilize functional hspc for the reconstitution of hematopoiesis without the requirement of g csf

4545185 on time 2 tells us more than the benefit of high dose tirofiban in pre pci the study reveals that high dose clopidogrel is not effective enough and confirms the needs for fast and strong platelet inhibition it reminds us also that the first contact with the patient must be rapid and medical until now only well organised hospital systems have been able to provide such a service

4545294 all this jesus said to the crowds in parables indeed he said nothing to them without a parable
4545295 only to the lost sheep of the house of israel
4545296 they shall suffer the punishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his might
4545297 you are to deliver this man to satan for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus
4545298 blessed is the man who trusts in the lord whose trust is the lord 8 he is like a tree planted by water that sends out its roots by the stream and does not fear when heat comes for its leaves remain green and is not anxious in the year of drought for it does not cease to bear fruit

4545302 for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by one mans obedience many will be made righteous

4545304 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified
4545305 all of humanity will come to believe in god as father and jesus as mediator savior and lord

4545479 it was a pleasure to sit down with senator mccain and discuss firsthand an issue that is americas top priority ending our dependence on foreign oil which today is approaching 70 percent we plan on having a similar meeting with senator obama in the very near future i have repeatedly stressed the nonpartisan aspects of my initiative this is a threat to our economic and national security and something that requires bipartisan support during the meeting i reiterated the urgency of the situation i told him that any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our foreign dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 in the next 10 years on top of conservation that is beginning to happen must utilize proven and available technologies and be 100 percent comprised of american resources we discussed my plan in some detail i also outlined our progress in building more than one million supporters who are actively pushing this issue with the goal of getting legislation passed in the first 100 days of the next administration that will get us on the path to radically reduce our dependence on foreign oil while i can not speak for the senator my sense is that he was interested and encouraged by the work we are doing and recognizes that citizen education and citizen involvement is key to changing course and actually developing a real energy policy with teeth that will help this country from our current disastrous path

4545483 quantas den ncias recebeu de trabalhadores ao longo do ano temos neste momento cerca de duas dezenas de processos temos tido alguns processos de trabalhadores que n o s o em rigor tempor rios designadamente em regime de recibo verde que apesar de n o se inserirem na nossa compet ncia temos procurado ajudar temos tamb m verificado que muitas vezes os trabalhadores que recorrem a n s n o pretendem assumir nenhum conflito fazem um pedido mais no sentido de serem informados sobre os seus direitos para poderem junto da sua entidade patronal invocar uma opini o que obtiveram do provedor muitas vezes at solicitam o anonimato ou seja que n o se fa a nenhuma dilig ncia junto da empresa
4545484 quais os temas mais suscitados pelos trabalhadores de trabalho tempor rio est o relacionados ou com c lculo de sal rios ou com f rias com subs dios tendo em conta que os trabalhadores tempor rios por vezes trabalham por pouco tempo isso torna de certa forma dif cil calcular os subs dios de f rias h casos variados
4545485 o provedor tem a possibilidade de avan ar com estes casos para tribunal com o interveniente n o primeiro porque como provedor intervenho a pedidos dos trabalhadores nos processos n o posso depois intervir como advogado isso seria eticamente muito conden vel podemos aconselhar o trabalhador a seguir esta ou aquela via processual mas na minha percep o a melhor forma de resolver os problemas atrav s da negocia o
4545486 os trabalhadores est o bem informados sobre a figura do provedor ainda n o existe essa informa o pelo menos com a dimens o que eu pretendia o provedor tem sido divulgado sobretudo atrav s da comunica o social queria concretizar uma maior divulga o por parte das empresas encontrar novas formas de divulga o talvez para o per odo depois das f rias queremos separar a p gina online do provedor da p gina da apespe tamb m para dar maior mostra de independ ncia
4545487 o provedor defende os trabalhadores tempor rios incluindo os da apespe sentiu algum tipo de press o est bem esclarecido que o provedor n o tem nenhuma fun o de defesa das empresas ou da associa o n o vejo porque que em rela o ao provedor do trabalhador tempor rio a quest o da press o se possa colocar nunca senti por exemplo que em rela o aos rg os de comunica o social houvesse d vidas em rela o independ ncia do provedor
4545488 foi necess rio um relat rio da comiss o de tica para esclarecer que n o h incompatibilidade entre as fun es de provedor e de deputado a pol mica suscitada pelo pcp pode ter desvirtuado as suas fun es reagi de forma decidida contra isso porque me parecia que havia uma politiza o at partidariza o indesej vel desta figura na altura surpreendeu me um pouco a viol ncia dos ataques embora saiba que h partidos e sectores pol tico partid rios que n o acreditam na responsabilidade social das empresas hoje em dia talvez n o reagisse com esse vigor porque acho que n o devemos deixar que estas figuras sejam envolvidas na luta pol tico partid ria
4545489 o trabalho tempor rio n o corre o risco de no futuro poder vir tamb m a ser penalizado como se prev no c digo do trabalho por exemplo para o caso dos recibos verdes o trabalho tempor rio est sujeito a uma legisla o muito estrita desde h algum tempo e que foi revista h pouco mais de um ano n o me parece que nesta altura seja uma quest ochave mexer na quest o do trabalho tempor rio temos de ter no o de que h situa es de precariedade mais perversas do que outras o caso dos recibos verdes que n o se pode comparar com situa es como contratos a termo ou trabalho tempor rio

4545494 it is the duty of any president in the final analysis to defend this nation and dispel the security threat saddam hussein has brought military action upon himself by refusing for 12 years to comply with the mandates of the united nations the brave and capable men and women of our armed forces and those who are with us will quickly i know remove him once and for all as a threat to his neighbors to the world and to his own people and i support their doing so
4545495 i think it was the right decision to disarm saddam hussein and when the president made the decision i supported him and i support the fact that we did disarm him
4545496 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins weapons of mass destruction
4545497 as a member of the house intelligence committee i am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
4545498 saddam hussein certainly has chemical and biological weapons theres no question about that
4545499 i come to this debate mr speaker as one at the end of 10 years in office on the permanent select committee on intelligence where stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was one of my top priorities i applaud the president on focusing on this issue and on taking the lead to disarm saddam hussein others have talked about this threat that is posed by saddam hussein yes he has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
4545500 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the united states and to our allies if saddam persists in thumbing his nose at the inspectors then were clearly going to have to do something about it
4545501 we stopped the fighting in 1991 on an agreement that iraq would take steps to assure the world that it would not engage in further aggression and that it would destroy its weapons of mass destruction it has refused to take those steps that refusal constitutes a breach of the armistice which renders it void and justifies resumption of the armed conflict

4545508 december of 2006 was a very cold month and we spent most of it outside what were we thinking i guess it was mainly that i couldn t pass up the chance to see pretty lights and ian was pretty easy to convince to go with me we went to see the parade of lights downtown at the beginning of the month it was a lot of fun but we sure did freeze the zoo lights we went to see later in the month and it was one of the coolest things i ve ever seen my favorite part was the under the sea area but i didn t get very good pictures of that part i look forward to going back again in the future and getting better pictures that aren t so blurry but can i convince ian to brave the cold again i hope so christmas lights have always seemed to have special powers over me i am just mesmerized by them and they always make me happy

4545591 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4545592 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future

4545667 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4545668 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4545669 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4545670 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat

4545674 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4545675 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4545676 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4545677 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4545678 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4545679 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4545680 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4545681 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4545682 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4545683 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4545684 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4545685 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4545686 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4545687 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4545688 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4545689 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4545690 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4545691 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4545692 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4545693 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4545694 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4545695 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed

4545742 think of it everything you had worked for 10 years coming down to one jump said dan gould an msu kinesiology professor who serves as forresters mental training coach in an e mail from south africa where hes teaching this summer
4545743 she did a great job of following her normal mental preparation routine keeping her focus in the present by focusing on a few process goals and blocking out the ramifications of the outcome
4545744 when you focus solely on sales where you have a prior sale price even homes selling near the beach have a significant decline
4545745 it tells you that none of these markets even near the sand are bulletproof
4545746 anything that sold from 2002 to 2005 and that sold recently had to have sold for less
4545747 thats when there was a big turn up a big escalation in price
4545748 theres no single perfect gauge to look at changes in home values so its best to look at several
4545749 this one is best for weeding out changes in the mix of homes selling
4545750 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations

4545769 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4545770 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4545771 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4545772 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4545816 alleged misrepresentations made by wachovia to thousands of its customers about the liquidity risk
4545817 we continue to work with state regulators and others to bring real relief to investors who were not given the forthright information they needed in the process of purchasing auction rate securities
4545818 this agreement in principle with wachovia if approved by the commission will permit tens of thousands of wachovia investors to get their money back
4545819 we understand that unprecedented market conditions have created difficulties for our clients particularly those holding auction rate securities
4545820 we are pleased to announce a comprehensive solution for the liquidity needs of clients who purchased auction rate securities at wachovia and to resolve this matter with federal and state regulators
4545821 todays settlement is a major step towards making these investors whole
4545822 i am pleased that six months of uncertainty and worry is over and that these investors will soon get their money back
4545823 the five settlements together provide relief to thousands of investors who were left holding nearly 35 billion worth of securities they could not sell after the widespread failure of the auction rate securities market this past february
4545824 at the heart of this investigation is the simple goal of returning billions of dollars back into the hands of investors which in turn injects confidence into the entire market
4545825 the industry is now taking responsibility for correcting a problem they helped create and well continue working to make all investors whole
4545826 it looks like youve cooked the books a bit because youre in favor of plaster

4545841 concerned to see how much top line growth is coming from low margin distribution deals out of ea partners
4545842 ea partners agreements generate two things for ea sales so it helps the top line and cash but the deals are low margin
4545843 ea is trying to get its margins up to 20 25 percent and these deals negatively impact that
4545844 these agreements make ea look more like a distributor than a developer of world class videogame titles its indicative of the fact that they are not able to develop enough of their own titles to meet their revenue and earnings goals that they need to fill in the gaps with these distribution deals
4545845 if they had their own properties say like what activision has they wouldnt need these distribution deals

4545926 the american psychological associations so called study is nothing more than a conclusion supported by opinions screened to match that predetermined outcome
4545927 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4545928 this finding was expected given the composition of the apa task force pro choice in a pro choice organization but provides testimony to the bias of apa in not even meeting with groups who represent women who believe abortion did lead to significant mental health problems
4545929 several groups sought to meet with apa but were rebuffed
4545930 the apa brushed them off just like it dismissed any scientific study that didnt agree with its agenda
4545931 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4545932 a number of studies have shown abortion in women to be associated with increased risks of major depression anxiety disorders substance abuse and suicidal behaviors
4545933 the report ignores a substantial and growing body of evidence consisting of testimonies based on womens real life experiences as cited by the supreme court in the gonzales v carhart decision last year which upheld the federal ban on partial birth abortion
4545934 has in effect said is that until there is compelling evidence to the contrary people should act as though abortion has no harmful effects
4545935 in this respect the response of the apa committee to this situation appears to follow the type of logic used by the tobacco industry to defend cigarettes since in our opinion there is no conclusive evidence of harm then the product may be treated as safe
4545936 a better logic is that used by the critics of the industry since there is suggestive evidence of harmful effects it behooves us to err on the side of caution and commission more and better research before drawing strong conclusions history showed which side had the better arguments

4545951 chp is a low cost resource for parents providing kids with access to health and vision care
4545952 these boys did everything they were suppose to do we are thankful that they knew enough not to touch it but to report the behavior to a veterinary clinic
4545953 we are still concerned however that others may have come in contact with this bat and if thats the case those individuals will need to seek immediate medical attention
4545954 these boys did everything they were suppose to do we are thankful that they knew enough not to touch it but to report the behavior to a veterinary clinic
4545955 we are still concerned however that others may have come in contact with this bat and if thats the case those individuals will need to seek immediate medical attention
4545956 these events will undoubtedly pave the way for greater conflict and disintegration in georgia
4545957 nino burdzhanadze was giving her first televised national address following the resignation of eduard shevardnadze we have managed to overcome the gravest crisis in georgias recent history without shedding a single drop of blood ms burdzhanadze said
4545958 washington and moscow treat the small weak divided caucasian states as mere pawns in a game in which the whole region acts as a gigantic chessboard america makes a move russia responds and the result is a war an assassination an explosion a military coup or a bloodless revolution we are now awaiting the next move in the game we do not know when or where moscow will respond but one thing we do know the losers will be the ordinary people the poor the defenceless
4545959 the russians had changed dramatically along with the balance of power in the region they welcomed the opportunity to drive home the new reality which was that they could invade georgia and the united states and europe could not respond as for risk they did not view the invasion as risky militarily there was no counter economically russia is an energy exporter doing quite well indeed the europeans need russian energy even more than the russians need to sell it to them politically as we shall see the americans needed the russians more than the russians needed the americans moscows calculus was that this was the moment to strike the russians had been building up to it for months and they struck
4545960 the russians knew the united states would denounce their attack this actually plays into russian hands the more vocal senior leaders are the greater the contrast with their inaction and the russians wanted to drive home the idea that american guarantees are empty talk
4545961 theyre not a major power theyre saudi arabia with trees
4545962 lenin stood for the unity of the peoples of the former tsarist empire but it had to be a voluntary unity that is why he insisted from the very beginning on the right to self determination this idea which is frequently misinterpreted to mean a demand for separation is entirely incorrect the bolsheviks did not advocate separation but defended the broadest possible extension of national self determination up to and including separation no one has the right to oblige a people to live within the confines of a state when the majority do not wish to do so but the right to self determination no more implies the demand to separate than the right to divorce means the demand that all couples must separate or that the right to abortion means that all pregnancies must be terminated
4545963 the right of self determination was an important part of lenins programme insofar as it demonstrated clearly to the oppressed workers and peasants especially the latter of poland georgia latvia and the ukraine that the russian workers had no interest in oppressing them and would firmly defend their right to determine their own destiny but this was only half of lenins programme on the national question the other half was equally as important the need to uphold the union of the proletariat above all national linguistic or religious differences as far as the bolshevik party was concerned lenin always opposed any tendency to divide the party and the workers movement in general along national lines
4545964 i declare war to the death of great russian chauvinism
4545965 after the revolution lenin hoped that there could be a voluntary and fraternal union of the peoples of the former tsarist empire in the form of a soviet federation to this end he demanded that the nationalities be treated with extreme sensitivity every manifestation of great russian chauvinism was to be rooted out as a matter of fact for some time after october the word russia disappeared altogether from official documents the official name of the homeland of october was simply the workers state
4545966 the last two to three weeks in august its vacation time take your kid to college time take fridays off time and definitely it happens year after year
4545967 i happen to be out in the hamptons and every investment professional i know is out here and will be here through labor day
4545968 i thought my train today was the emptiest ive seen
4545969 but for most of the summer the trains have been packed the whole economy is showing some pressure
4545970 wall street is a huge employer in new york and theres no doubt wall street is under pressure
4545971 then you walk by a chipotle and there are lines down the street
4545972 i dont think there is a typical august but there can be big inflection points in the market
4545973 were torn between a couple variables most people think that a lot of the financial structural problems are on their way to recovery but arent so sure about the economy
4545974 still i think weve accumulated enough good will that were not going to break down sharply
4545975 hiring people to throw themselves in front of these things so they dont accidentally brush against me
4545976 are particularly useful in a sentence that is long and complex
4545977 two militants attempted to flee and were pursued by coalition military working dogs
4545978 both militants received dog bite injuries one of which required treatment on scene by coalition medical personnel

4546004 never seen anything like this in my career for software
4546005 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4546006 you are dealing with a people who despise anyting human
4546007 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4546008 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4546009 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4546010 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4546011 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4546012 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4546013 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4546014 what this does is it provides us better capability increased competencies more experience and greater knowledge to do the things that we are already doing today
4546015 theyre going to be able to bring back an esprit de corps that you learn within the seal community we dont always have that
4546016 we have a great service im very proud to wear the blue but the esprit de corps that comes out of the folks that go to buds and members of seal teams those experiences that knowledge that mindset are all things that are going to benefit the coast guard in the long term
4546017 what that means to us is approximately two seal platoons
4546018 this just adds a greater base of qualified candidates that dont come from recruits in the navy or from the fleet its a win win for everyone
4546019 valuable skills and knowledge to support the dod and increase the coast guards capabilities in our ports waterways and coastal security mission specifically counter terrorism and anti terrorism operations
4546020 when you look at the way the coast guards evolving bringing in that type of mentality and culture and understanding of the operations is going to be great for our organization
4546021 this is historic its different but i think its very consistent with the long partnership weve had with the united states navy stretching all the way back to our birth 218 years ago
4546022 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4546023 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4546024 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4546025 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4546026 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4546027 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans
4546028 a divine madness poisoned his mind tainting his name during the night
4546029 from baghdad with love a marine the war and dog named lava
4546030 the war came home with my husband all four times
4546031 your perceived lack of language skill is no longer an excuse for being shy ha ha ha
4546032 hey theres bocachica san you wanted to talk to him
4546033 im a yakyuu blogger and i used to live in seattle

4546036 dude if you didnt block the damn plate you wouldnt have these problems with guys sliding into your leg
4546037 this crazy gaijin girl also keeps a scorecard and she can write kanji
4546038 hey wait a minute ive seen you before you were in sendai cheering for the fighters last weekend too werent you
4546039 i saw you guys too and in fukuoka two weeks ago
4546040 i think youll have no trouble making some new friends here
4546041 gaijin are too disgusting to even sit next to on the train
4546042 wait you also write these at kamagaya and you were there on may 12
4546043 i think thats the day i threw out the ceremonial first pitch
4546044 yeah i won a fan janken contest and got to throw out the pitch i threw an overhand curve did you see
4546045 i definitely saw i probably even took a photo of you are you sure thats the right game
4546046 definitely kikuchi pitcher started nakata kun was playing and jones player the fighters lost i remember all of this
4546047 well i am going to look through my photos when i get home and if i find you i will send it to you can we trade emails
4546048 see you next week at the tokyo dome in the outfield bleachers
4546049 great prince always remember to take care for one day you will rule our beautiful city
4546050 great prince we love you your parents the king and queen have always been fair and just rulers we know their beneficence will continue when the day comes that you will rule
4546051 beet and carrot soup wherever did you get a taste for that
4546052 ive liked the combination for as long as i can remember someone must have served it to me as an infant
4546053 it doesnt really matter does it beets and carrots are very good for you
4546054 she created a son for you and at the same time a prince who could release her from the horrible curse
4546055 can i please have a gordita crunch and a soft taco
4546056 manufacturers reported a 1 5 per cent increase in unfilled orders in june as the backlog advanced to 64 2 billion
4546057 when i told my clients about it there were tears of joy
4546058 now they can make 9 11 their story too its a great day
4546059 congress wanted to know the facts before they provided relief and the families wanted relief before they identified themselves
4546060 with the expectation that congress will take up this matter within the year
4546061 our view was that if indeed we are granting the relief because these families ought to be part of the american story and american institutions as we believe part of that is taking on the responsibilities of people living in the united states lawfully
4546062 my hope and plan and dream is that now that these families are legally present in the united states
4546063 congress will act quickly to give them green card status
4546064 sebuah bentuk cinta yang membawa manfaat atau kebaikan cinta lawan jenis dalam koridor keagamaan
4546065 saya bersyukur film ayat ayat cinta sangat fenomenal dan ini bisa diikuti dan dihayati anak muda menuju kebaikan semua ini merupakan bentuk anugerah allah untuk menguji saya apakah saya tenggelam dalam kufur nikmat atau saya bersyukur pada allah soal puas atau tidak dengan hasil lalu saya sendiri tidak pernah puas dengan karya novel saya selalu ingin menjadi lebih baik dan lebih baik lagi selama karya saya turut andil dalam negara ini silahkan saja
4546066 sebelum ada tawaran ini saya sudah membaca novelnya dan berkhayal untuk bisa difilmkan karena konfliknya dalam dan halus pucuk dicinta ulam tiba
4546067 dalam sebuah karya tidak ada istilah tua dan muda dibandingkan hanung bramatyo selalu muda dan saya optimis karena tema islam sedang diminati dan sudah lama saya tidak mendapatkan kesempatan seperti ini secara pribadi saya optimis tinggal tunggu takdir
4546068 saya menyambut gembira rencana sinemart untuk membuat film ini karena film sebelumnya ayat ayat cinta aac yang juga diangkat dari novel habiburrahman el shirazy terbukti memperoleh sambutan baik dari masyarakat
4546069 saya harap film ini bisa menjadi film yang murni seni dakwah dan mencerdaskan kehidupan bangsa
4546070 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through
4546071 im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4546072 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
4546073 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
4546074 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
4546075 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
4546076 it seems very clear to me this year that the unfortunate practice of paying circulators by the signature seems to directly correlate to the significant amount of bad signatures being collected
4546077 as i have called for in the past the legislature should look closely at this problem and at the problem of privately funded voter registration drives that arent properly getting people registered
4546078 in the end both of these problems are negatively affecting this years petition process as being among the largest failure rates in the history of our state
4546079 the verifying process of checking millions of petition signatures is something my office takes very seriously in compliance with the arizona revised statutes
4546080 the passports have been returned to all of them but we dont know why they were taken
4546081 we spoke to the zimbabwean officials who assured us they would allow them to travel
4546082 human rights watch should not interfere in the internal matters of angola
4546083 what they said in the report is offensive and has no basis of truth we know human rights watch hatred towards the angolan people all that i ask is that they stop interfering with the electoral process
4546084 more than 100 mpla supporters carrying machetes stones and sticks attacked members of a unita delegation campaigning in londuimbali the province of huambo
4546085 me and jay decided im going to stay with him
4546086 what im going to do is take over his basement
4546087 what were going to do is im going to stay in the game plan and at night were going to throw
4546088 and after we throw well watch film and hes going to go over the game plan with me as if i was there
4546089 the whole denver broncos organization has been great to me all i can do is just show them that im here now and when i get back and be accountable
4546090 i studied the film and i was always amazed on a lot of plays it was really me
4546091 it wasnt the offensive line not getting a block or anything like that or anything they were doing really it was really me kind of hurting myself
4546092 i was able to take a lot from those tapes
4546093 just being more patient and learning to play up the gut more
4546094 well its no pressure for me to be honest because im harder on myself than anybody thats really how i do things
4546095 i set my goals high and the expectations high for myself and i work hard at accomplishing those goals
4546096 i hit him and its my fault but i am so broken hearted
4546097 i was just goofing around when i started building it
4546098 i was thinking of how to get tourists to come to the area it was a if you build it they will come sort of deal
4546099 i respect gracelands need to protect the copyright but it was more of an artistic statement
4546100 personal reasons nose tackle pat kuntz 42 tackles led the nations defensive linemen with nine passes broken up
4546101 i cant help them with their problem they cant see me i can be like 68 years old and im still trouble because theyre thinking about something in vietnam or theyre thinking about jane fonda or they think i slept with their daughter they think i burned my draft card its like a big rorschach of things that i did or did not do
4546102 i think that denver officials would be well advised not to believe everything that the fbi warns them about
4546103 thats how things can get out of hand due to fabricated exaggerated projections about violence or protest
4546104 what you saw in 2000 was the claim that 75 000 anarchists were descending the secret funding of permanent police equipment the denial of permits for protesters you saw the same thing in 2004 you will see the same thing in 2008
4546105 i planned for multiple scenarios not knowing which one would play out
4546106 but certainly after the murder of kennedy coming on the murder of king to me it was in the air that we were going to be busted and face serious harm unless we surrendered and left the city and simply went along with the plan just go along with our own disappearance
4546107 in evaluating this case you should bear in mind that your prime objectives should be to neutralize him in the new left movement
4546108 thousands of hairy yippies were going to have sex in public while drinking from the lsd laden waters of lake michigan they actually believed that and this sex in the parks on acid would occur at roughly the same moment that black revolutionaries would storm the convention with guns
4546109 named strangely enough in memory of chicago police killed by an anarchists bomb during a violent confrontation between police and protesters in 1886
4546110 it takes two for a riot to occur and if it wasnt for the fbi advisers chicago 68 would not have happened repeat would not have happened
4546111 i do think they are playing around unnecessarily with the rights of protesters to protest
4546112 i dont know how the negotiations will come out but you know naming something a protest zone but then not allowing it to be heard or seen its a mockery of the first amendment most importantly its not necessary
4546113 it does seem to me theres a legitimate right to protest at stake
4546114 i dont think the protests will be very large if obama is the nominee i dont see the point in interfering with them its particularly crazy because most of the delegates at the democratic convention have been in many demonstrations themselves
4546115 the message was that the people coming to protest deserve this kind of repression if they get out of hand theyre just trying to scare the public into justifying more tax dollars for a false sense of security more gadgets for the police department
4546116 if they had given us permits i doubt there would have been much confrontation at all
4546117 what caused the rioting in the streets was the lack of permits and the lack of a place to stay too much order creates disorder is the way ive always put it
4546118 you dont have the draft you have one fifteenth of the american casualties now that you had at this point during vietnam the establishment is doing everything it can to keep this war from impacting the american people and yet people have seen through it
4546119 which i think means the ghosts of 68 are still with us people know a quagmire when they see one
4546120 you want the foraging individual to go back to the colony so the bait can be distributed to the colony roaches dont share food like ants but bait stations work best for them too as well as ants if you dont enjoy bugs its best to seek help from a licensed professional
4546121 there are some ant types that have multiple queens and if theyre sprayed with a store product it can compound the problem and cause ants to spread out or recolonize
4546122 a sobering documentation of the growing threat of nutrient pollution in coastal waters around the world
4546123 the evidence suggests that if the spigot of nutrients can be turned off coastal systems can recover
4546124 doing it can be accomplished by using fertilizers more efficiently preventing human and animal sewage from entering rivers and replanting vegetation along riverbanks to absorb excess nutrients
4546125 however nutrient inputs are again rising there as agriculture expands and a return to hypoxic conditions may be imminent
4546126 ethnic cleansing broke out in georgia and neighboring republics the abkhazia area within georgia achieved de facto autonomy in the midst of such violent conflict the surrounding region has become a swirling sea of hostile populations occasional killing and al qaeda recruiting
4546127 we are a people in a quandary about the present
4546128 it was kind of like a political awakening for me
4546129 barbara jordan was just somebody who was unbelievably dynamic inspiring somebody who was so symbolic of what i wanted to become
4546130 jim carter does not need to look any further for a vice president she is superior to any of the candidates he is considering
4546131 while i respect governor carters sensitivity to the needs of blacks and women i do not feel that the country is ready to accept a woman in the second highest office in the land
4546132 however when that time does come i plan to be ready
4546133 i appreciate very much your vote of confidence in me and your belief that i am qualified to be the vice presidential nominee of the democratic party
4546134 i chose not to have my name placed in nomination for the position because i believe that if and when my name or the name of any other black american is placed in nomination it should be done with a serious intent such was not the case for my name being placed in nomination in new york city
4546135 the black world her world the fifth ward of houston
4546136 she did listen but she wanted you to take her advice particularly
4546137 she would listen to some of the things that i said but she really liked to have the last word
4546138 she was strong in her convictions and she even softened his heart in a sense too
4546139 today i am an inquisitor and hyperbole would not be fictional and would not overstate the solemnness that i feel
4546140 my faith in the constitution is whole it is complete it is total and i am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution the subversion the destruction of the constitution
4546141 there is something special about tonight what is different what is special i barbara jordan am a keynote speaker
4546142 many fear the future many are distrustful of their leaders and believe that their voices are never heard many seek only to satisfy their private wants to satisfy their private interests
4546143 but this is the great danger america faces that we will cease to be one nation and become instead a collection of interest groups each seeking to satisfy private wants if that happens who then will speak for america who then will speak for the common good this is the question which must be answered in 1976 are we to be one people bound together by common spirit sharing in a common endeavor or will we become a divided nation
4546144 there is not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
4546145 perhaps the times were right for a black woman to step forth and represent the entire nation because thats what she did
4546146 we made progress up to the 70s but so much more progress needs to be made to get america ready
4546147 because the very question that is being raised there would be no reason for the question if we were ready nobody would ask are we ready we would just move along
4546148 i eagerly anticipate the remaining installments this series has the potential to motivate todays readers to go beyond the comics and discover the excitement of the novel itself if you have not already invested in this series i highly recommend you do
4546149 one of the first online investor resources providing in depth information on renewable energy greentech and water sectors
4546150 ive sat down for a chat with roque the lad is happy and he wants to stay at blackburn rovers
4546151 stephen warnock has come back and said he had no intention of putting a transfer request in
4546152 it annoys me because there are clubs out there trying to unsettle my players its something im not happy about
4546153 it is silly because were preparing for a massive game against everton and some people seem to be creating so many issues at blackburn which arent there
4546154 the players that i want to keep are not leaving this club its as simple as that
4546155 we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
4546156 things should be made as simple as possible but no simpler
4546157 damn everytime we do something at kickapps it looks like youre right on it
4546158 oh i must store my post in cms a because i need versioning
4546159 oh i must post my video in cms b because it streams content
4546160 dialogue between a u s government agency and its citizens
4546161 techcrunch post on 4 17 seattle times on 4 17 centernetworks
4546162 he urged the absolute exclusion of all chinese immigrants he would even return many chinamen already here it was a race he said to be fought off like a pestilence
4546163 felizmente la nueva prueba que la nueva prueba que tenemos no fue un cambio para mal en la validez predictiva
4546164 you hated it when you were in the grave of depression then flying high as a kite you hated that too
4546165 in order to defeat the dragon you must first learn his behavior
4546166 narrow issues and ensure that the draft environmental impact statement deis will be a concise accurate and complete document that is adequate for public review
4546167 this is a classic case of stalling the process what they are asking for will take months to complete
4546168 ich sehe aus heutiger sicht keinen grund von dem ziel abzur cken
4546169 i dont care what craigs family members think he did this to my son may he get what he deserves maybe people should talk more about camryn than craig craigs name has no worth to even be mentioned
4546170 but its over i said what i had to say he believes what he believes and thats that
4546171 noen i fully support teresas use of my quote and in fact am flattered by it you fail to grasp t
4546172 it is truly awful that my reaction after an immediate and deep desire to own and wear that balaclav
4546173 that looks more like miguel mouse than mickey and yes im profiling disney characters
4546174 if awful is a misspelling of awesome then i agree this looks a million times more fun than any of
4546175 mind you how theyve never been sued for ehight discrimination is beyond me characters are paid

4546227 we anticipate that oecd organization for economic cooperation and development inventories will build strongly and start the fourth quarter at levels towards the top of the historic range
4546228 we predict that the price retrenchment will continue as the prospect of a return to double digit oil prices grows
4546229 judging by the demand destruction in north america and europe plus the expected post olympic hangover in china i think inventories will build
4546230 this year with continued restraint in refinery throughput and extra saudi supply arriving onshore we expect flat or building crude inventories
4546231 the groups likely main concern is to respond quickly in the event of a further sharp fall in oil prices if this is due to an excess of supply
4546232 opec was badly hurt by oversupplying the market at the wrong time during the 1990s
4546233 opec is going to be more risk averse i e holding back supply rather than oversupplying it to placate the economy
4546234 risks to the outlook for the world oil market appear to be on the downside with current opec production well above the expected demand for opec crude there is potential for a sharp build in crude oil inventories
4546235 i see the need for opec to cut production or risk flooding a slack market with crude
4546236 over the next 18 months there appears to be the potential for a modest build in the supply cushion due to the combination of weaker economic growth and a concentration of new projects in opec and non opec countries coming on line
4546237 there is the potential for an easing of market tightness
4546238 saudis output increase has been easily absorbed in the market and is unlikely to help build any inventory in an environment where there is a sharp contraction in non opec supply

4546278 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4546279 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4546285 aipacs decision to shun hagee says something terrible about the state of american jewish politics today quite simply hagee has become a victim of liberal american jewish leaders decision to place their leftist political preferences above their concern for israels survival and for the well being of american jewry

4546329 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4546330 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4546331 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4546332 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there

4546337 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer
4546338 this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last

4546408 that would take years of preparation its tough heath set the bar at a new level which i think is fantastic for comic book lovers and movie lovers he changed the face of what people expect out of those films if you watch the old ones i mean they were great for what they were having danny elfmans music but this is a new level

4546424 postwar american capitalism was hardly the unchanging and soulless machine imagined by countercultural leaders it was as dynamic a force in its own way as the revolutionary youth movements of the period undertaking dramatic transformations of both the way it operated and the way it imagined itself
4546425 it was and remains dificult to distinguish precisely between authentic counterculture and fake by almonst every account the counter culture as a mass movement distinct from the bohemias that preceeded it was triggered at least as much by developments in mass culture particularly the arrival of the beatles in 1964 as changes at the grass roots
4546426 as it turns out many in american business imagined the counterculture not as an enemy to be undermined or a threat to consumer culture but as a hopeful sign a symbolic ally in their own struggles against the mountains of dead weight procedure and hierarchy that had accumulated over the years like the young insurgents people in more advanced reaches of the american corporate world deplored conformity distrusted routine and encouraged resistance to established power they welcomed the youth led cultural revolution not because they believed it would allow them to tap a gigantic youth market although this was of course a factor but because they perceived in it a comrade in their own struggles to revitalize american business and the consumer order generally
4546427 as to the t mobile rumor i really cant comment but android has been due for sometime now
4546428 q4 delivery of an android product would make sense and htc does seem to be the most likely device manufacturer to deliver a first android device
4546429 htc is good at developing uis user interfaces and touchscreen interfaces and also at working with a complex operating system like windows mobile i have pretty strong faith in htcs ability to work with linux and android and roll out a device that t mobile htc google and the open handset alliance will be happy with
4546430 there have been complaints on the developer side around the sdk software developer kit it is also facing competition from other oses operating systems namely the limo foundations flavor of mobile linux the no 1 seller of smartphones has also announced its intent to offer the os royalty free and we cant forget about blackberry the iphone and windows mobile devices
4546431 android is late to the party and will have a tough time gaining significant market share in this crowded marketplace but at the end of the day google wants more openness in wireless networks with greater access to the internet from mobile devices this is happening
4546432 with android you dont have one device that you can use as a frame of reference

4546474 exactamente no puedo decir cuanto ya que las negociaciones las est llevando el presidente pero ya s lo quedan unas peque as diferencias
4546475 it is the duty of any president in the final analysis to defend this nation and dispel the security threat saddam hussein has brought military action upon himself by refusing for 12 years to comply with the mandates of the united nations the brave and capable men and women of our armed forces and those who are with us will quickly i know remove him once and for all as a threat to his neighbors to the world and to his own people and i support their doing so
4546476 i think it was the right decision to disarm saddam hussein and when the president made the decision i supported him and i support the fact that we did disarm him
4546477 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins weapons of mass destruction
4546478 as a member of the house intelligence committee i am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
4546479 saddam hussein certainly has chemical and biological weapons theres no question about that
4546480 i come to this debate mr speaker as one at the end of 10 years in office on the permanent select committee on intelligence where stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was one of my top priorities i applaud the president on focusing on this issue and on taking the lead to disarm saddam hussein others have talked about this threat that is posed by saddam hussein yes he has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
4546481 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the united states and to our allies if saddam persists in thumbing his nose at the inspectors then were clearly going to have to do something about it
4546482 we stopped the fighting in 1991 on an agreement that iraq would take steps to assure the world that it would not engage in further aggression and that it would destroy its weapons of mass destruction it has refused to take those steps that refusal constitutes a breach of the armistice which renders it void and justifies resumption of the armed conflict

4546506 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4546515 the current standard of care in allograft stem cell mobilization involving g csf requires donors to undergo treatment over a period of several days it is also associated with established risks such as bone pain and there have always been theoretical concerns that it could stimulate bone marrow abnormalities clearly a treatment that can reduce time to collection and also reduce risks associated with the use of g csf would represent a major advance for both donors and the patients who need blood stem cell transplants in the years ahead
4546516 these results indicate that hspc mobilization with plerixafor a direct antagonist of the sdf 1 cxcr interaction can safely and effectively mobilize functional hspc for the reconstitution of hematopoiesis without the requirement of g csf
4546517 our trial was not powered on a difference in clinical outcome between the two groups however we noted a better clinical outcome in the tirofiban group than in the placebo group with lower overall mortality and less urgent repeat pci our finding that routine prehospital initiation of high bolus dose tirofiban improved st segment resolution and clinical outcome after pci emphasises that further platelet aggregation inhibition besides high dose clopidogrel is mandated in patients with stemi undergoing pci
4546518 on time 2 tells us more than the benefit of high dose tirofiban in pre pci the study reveals that high dose clopidogrel is not effective enough and confirms the needs for fast and strong platelet inhibition it reminds us also that the first contact with the patient must be rapid and medical until now only well organised hospital systems have been able to provide such a service
4546519 developing an alternative method of administering vaccine therapy that is well tolerated by most patients and produces similar immune responses to standard methods may help further the development of vaccine therapies for prostate cancer
4546520 based on safety and feasibility metronomic dosing appears to be superior to standard dosing and administration
4546521 more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this dosing method in treating prostate cancer
4546522 in people at high vascular risk telmisartans effects on major renal outcomes are similar to ramipril although combination therapy reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than monotherapy overall it worsens major renal outcomes
4546523 the findings of ontarget support previous guidelines that propose use of drugs to block the renin angiotensin system as part of an antihypertensive regimen to lower blood pressure and urinary protein in chronic kidney disease these data should not lead to guideline modifications combined with previous studies ontarget supports the notion that use of single agents to block the renin angiotensin system is well tolerated

4546594 the recent oil price move if sustained is a game changing event for the industry
4546595 i see it as the airlines restricting the availability of the lowest fares and forcing people to pay the higher fares that are already in place
4546596 its not easy to increase fares by double digit levels in a weak economy
4546597 i believe there will be between 4 and 10 successful airfare hikes the rest of this year depending on the price of oil
4546598 the rise of sovereign wealth funds impacts on us foreign policy and economic interests

4546600 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4546601 i was in high school when she hit it big
4546602 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4546603 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4546604 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4546605 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4546606 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4546607 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4546608 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4546609 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4546610 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4546611 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4546612 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4546613 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4546614 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40

4546624 with its unique structure and low fees the sum program delivers a flexible surcharge free solution that allows participating institutions to retain control over their own surcharging revenue while managing their expenses with an attractive per transaction fee structure
4546625 these institutions join a steadily growing group across the country that see sum as an economical and effective way to expand their geographic reach providing greater convenience and surcharge free access to funds for their customers and members
4546626 our strong organic revenue growth of 21 compared to second quarter 2007 demonstrates that we are executing on our growth strategy
4546627 our revenue growth catalyst continues to be global payplus r with 34 increase in revenues compared to the second quarter of 2007 our leadership in this market is evident by the closing of another deal with a major uk bank and i believe that we will continue to experience good growth at the high end of the market in the second half of 2008 and beyond

4546648 at age 21 i became a democrat democrats were the part of the working class who stood against the republican party which by and large served the interests of the millionaire class old money then in the north state governments shifted from funding education to increased regulation most of the democratic leadership did little to improve our lives so i became a libertarian
4546649 then massachusetts changed its rules were trying to change them back i hope we succeed because i want to keep my promise on replacement if we fail chris bennett and i will wage a vigorous campaign across massachusetts well campaign for the libertarian goals of peace liberty and prosperity well campaign against democratic and republican achievements perpetual war ever fewer civil liberties a bigger national debt falling standards of living

4546656 that which if accepted leads the mind to an apprehension of a condition other and different from that which exists a statement made to mislead
4546657 unfortunately yes pit bulls are very dangerous when a labrador collie or other dog bites you might end up with a bruise or in some cases a puncture wound when a pit bull attacks you may end up maimed for life or in many cases dead
4546658 every legitimate study conducted in america including the study by the centers for disease control in atlanta has demonstrated that pit bull bites are more likely to result in a fatality than bites or attacks by any other breed
4546659 a cdc study on fatal dog bites lists the breeds involved in fatal attacks over 20 years it does not identify specific breeds that are most likely to bite or kill and thus is not appropriate for policy making decisions related to the topic each year 4 7 million americans are bitten by dogs these bites result in approximately 16 fatalities about 0 0002 percent of the total number of people bitten these relatively few fatalities offer the only available information about breeds involved in dog bites there is currently no accurate way to identify the number of dogs of a particular breed and consequently no measure to determine which breeds are more likely to bite or kill
4546660 pit bulls account for less than 3 4 of the dogs in our country
4546661 no accurate way to identify the number of dogs of a particular breed
4546662 another study conducted in 1982 through 2006 similarly concluded that 44 of all fatalities from dog attacks involved pit bulls
4546663 veterinarians and their staff are often specially trained to deal with aggressive dogs vets are understandably careful about publicly bashing any breed of dog for fear of backlash from the public
4546664 pit bull fans always point out that helen keller owned one but they fail to mention that more recently michael vick owned 49 pit bulls and the

4546673 as to the t mobile rumor i really cant comment but android has been due for sometime now
4546674 q4 delivery of an android product would make sense and htc does seem to be the most likely device manufacturer to deliver a first android device
4546675 htc is good at developing uis user interfaces and touchscreen interfaces and also at working with a complex operating system like windows mobile i have pretty strong faith in htcs ability to work with linux and android and roll out a device that t mobile htc google and the open handset alliance will be happy with
4546676 there have been complaints on the developer side around the sdk software developer kit it is also facing competition from other oses operating systems namely the limo foundations flavor of mobile linux the no 1 seller of smartphones has also announced its intent to offer the os royalty free and we cant forget about blackberry the iphone and windows mobile devices
4546677 android is late to the party and will have a tough time gaining significant market share in this crowded marketplace but at the end of the day google wants more openness in wireless networks with greater access to the internet from mobile devices this is happening
4546678 with android you dont have one device that you can use as a frame of reference
4546679 a large number of developers dont know what it an android phone is going to look like or how popular its going to be i dont see or hear a large number of developers that are developing for android yet

4546687 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel
4546688 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
4546689 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
4546690 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
4546691 there are instantaneous communications taking place around the world and we need to figure out how to take advantage of that opportunity instead of looking at it as a nemesis
4546692 you can call it strategic communication you can call it information engagement i like to call it operating in the information domain of the 21st century

4546704 for a couple bucks you can be at a great beach on the atlantic ocean or long island sound theyre free to use and you dont have to prove residency or join some club
4546705 ive been to the best beaches in the world and id rather come here than any of them you have the history of the place and the diversity of people a lot of people in new york city dont know about it and thats better for us

4546746 hitler eva braun y 13 jerarcas nazis aterrizaron en barcelona el 27 de abril de 1945 en un vuelo que parti de berl n e hizo escala en linz austria
4546747 viajaron en un junker 290 n mero de serie 0163 c digo pipq que tiempo despu s fue localizado por los aliados en un aeropuerto naval de la localidad de travem nde cercana a hamburgo
4546748 apenas fue un trampol n para el escape de hitler en submarino hacia suram rica
4546749 el documento del fbi fechado en mayo de 1947 cobra valor uniendo todos estos datos hist ricos aunque mi teor a es que hitler estuvo en espa a no m s de un mes y ya hab a abandonado ese pa s cuando el ej rcito estadounidense lo busc all
4546750 los alemanes dejaron cad veres en los b nkers con credenciales de sus jerarcas para que el mundo creyera que se trataba de ellos incluso se utilizaron varios dobles de hitler
4546751 hab a recibido varios cad veres que pertenec an supuestamente a hitler
4546752 he conseguido tambi n encontrar documentaci n en la que jos stalin y otros generales sovi ticos hablan del escape de hitler a espa a
4546753 when we find an appropriate time i am sure that we will proceed both with globalcom and reliance infratel
4546754 revised schedule of activities will be announced separately on receipt of observations from sebi
4546755 i have come to the conclusion that i love you
4546756 kanske om jag g r ner i pressrummet s tar matchen slut
4546757 i remember this episode where god became so pissed with the israelites that he struck them with disease resulting in massacre of the entire generation
4546758 it is not what you say but how you say it
4546759 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4546760 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4546761 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game
4546762 absolutely i would absolutely i would because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow til death do us part how in the world can i trust you to lead my family my government my nation absolutely i would i think people first need to ask forgiveness and then earn trust back over time can trust be re earned absolutely but it takes time

4546768 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
4546769 my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hears our before him and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
4546770 hillary and bill have hijacked the denver convention making it into a carbon copy of what it would have looked like had she won until the last possible moment
4546771 why of course the people dont want war why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4546772 beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor for patriotism is indeed a double edged sword it both emboldens the blood just as it narrows the mind and when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry rather the citizenry infused with fear and blinded by patriotism will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so how do i know for this is what i have done and i am caesar
4546773 the disposition of noble dogs is to be gentle with people they know and the opposite with those they dont know how then can the dog be anything other than a lover of learning since it defines whats its own and whats alien
4546774 mom and dad say i should make my life an example of the principles i believe in but every time i do they tell me to stop it
4546775 councils would step in to deal with an under nourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different
4546776 there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the welfare of children is in real jeopardy
4546777 enjoy the little things for one day you may look back and realize they were the big
4546778 we remain hopeful that well see a tentative agreement this weekend
4546779 the optimal position for wearing a backpack is high on the upper back with straps over both shoulders
4546780 kids who wear their backpacks in the more stylish lower back position or only use one strap may suffer shoulder pain and posture problems
4546781 whats interesting here is that contrary to popular belief its not just the weight of the backpack but how its carried
4546782 and the pain generated is not just on the back it includes the pressure on the skin which causes nerve pain similar to that tingling sensation caused when a leg or arm falls asleep
4546783 its possible that our subjects alter their posture by elevating the right shoulder thus increasing the contact pressure on that shoulder
4546784 if those postures are practiced over a long period of time with more weight and pressure on one shoulder it may alter posture and produce prolonged pain we need to study this further
4546785 following these recommendations may require conscious effort from the kids encouragement from parents peers and school staff until it becomes habitual
4546786 although professionals and parents cannot often dictate what children should carry it is important for us to educate them so they carry the packs correctly
4546787 parents also need to check what their children are carrying we found that quite often its not just books and school work thats weighing them down but ipods and laptop computers and other things they may not need to carry to school everyday
4546788 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
4546789 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use
4546790 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it except copy it
4546791 we take our intellectual property seriously and are considering appropriate action on this matter
4546792 my earliest stuff that i listened to like the rolling stones you know ac dc
4546793 i started life out as a drummer i wanted to be peter criss and then later on i found it really hard to write songs on the drums so thats kinda why i switched to guitar and then later on guns n roses m tley cr e aerosmith it all made more sense to me because it was all based in the blues you know thats kinda where it started for me
4546794 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4546795 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4546796 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4546797 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4546798 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4546799 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
4546800 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests

4546831 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4546832 as far as the numbers game is concerned it is all over
4546833 so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4546834 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4546835 the world and countries in the region have seen that not nato but russia is the only one who could secure the energy routes
4546836 in this context regarding turkeys energy politics it should be said that the btc is not running at the moment and it will not run again
4546837 two militants attempted to flee and were pursued by coalition military working dogs

4546841 the art or practice of engaging in controversial debate or dispute
4546842 rhetoric is useful because truth and justice are in their nature stronger than their opposites
4546843 retirement in my book is giving up work to do what you love doing and we happen to love bluegrass music so were having a blast
4546844 me and my pals at the somerset poolroom aint famous for nothing but standing around broke
4546845 oh man ive got something to tell you that you gotta hear
4546846 last night the ex and i had a meeting with the middle boys therapy person i got there about 15 minutes before the ex which i now think was by design on the doctors part
4546847 well he asked me into his office right away normally one of us waited outside until we all arrived when i sat down he asked how things were going and we exchanged ten seconds of pleasantries then he asked me if i had trouble getting the kids to school and events on time i told him no not normally the doctor then told me hed been told the boys were tardy at school quite a bit last year
4546848 i can only imagine thats the word on the street
4546849 i had lunch with earlier and he didnt say anything about it
4546850 i told the doc the boys had been tardy a lot the year before last and that was my fault i thought they needed to be to school at 8 30 when in fact they needed to be at their desks by 8 30 when i got that sorted out the tardiness ended this past year however we were on time the vast majority of the time i told the doc id be happy to send him the attendance records as i thought this might clear up who is more likely to be giving him bad information as for the sports and recreation things well theres three of them
4546851 i drove 170 miles one sunday between soccer and football fields and never left columbus i saw half a football game and half a soccer game once in a while something gets screwed up i think though one of the items hes referring to the word that may be on the street involves a game samson missed in the past it had been assumed i just hadnt taken him to a practice when in fact he was home sick in bed and id driven to the field to let the coaches know he was home sick
4546852 so its almost like there was some sort of thought out there that you missed something when in fact youd gone an extra step to make sure everybody knew what was going on
4546853 yes however im not without blame i goofed one or two things up over the course of the season
4546854 a few minutes later and you know she didnt look at me once the whole time we were in there
4546855 something similar to the getup you had on the other day when you were moving dirt and mulch around
4546856 thats an interesting choice i thought maybe you had on a mccain shirt or something
4546857 mccain yea right no i had on a pink polo shirt i got at target for 3 64 i picked up two that day i cant imagine why they were the only ones marked down
4546858 well at one point we discussed the exs method of checking for homework vs
4546859 do you think the boys got more homework slips when they were with one of you more than the other
4546860 no the big homework problem was things werent getting written down in the first place by the child at school if the assignment isnt in the book the ex wasnt going to read about it and neither was the child theyd get homework slips when they missed things with her and theyd get some when they were with me from march to may the middle boy just had one homework slip and he got that one when he was away from me getting just one in that time period was an incredible feat as hed been getting one or two or more weekly
4546861 do you think it helps the child to go through his backpack every night
4546862 when do they learn they have to be responsible for their own things
4546863 your ex always seemed to have pretty good organizational skills
4546864 there was an undercurrent of her superior orgaizational skillness floating around the meeting
4546865 dude this was nothing new i was so unfazed by the whole thing that i got worried that maybe im out of touch with reality i honestly think im a decent person a nice guy a good father and able to pull of wearing a pink shirt and while i honestly think that i accept the fact i may be delusional however i like to think my therapy person would tell me if i were
4546866 maybe anyway when i went home i pulled out the attendance records from last year
4546867 yea and i knew where they were i had them in my hands five minutes after i walked in the door
4546868 maybe it could have been three or four minutes i got a glass of milk first
4546869 last year the youngest was tardy 0 times the middle boy was tardy 3 times and the eldest boy was tardy 6 times
4546870 dont they all ride the same bus or get out of the same car at the same time
4546871 yes and ive wondered the same thing maybe the youngests room is closer to the door i dont know maybe the teachers mark tardies differently maybe the youngest goofs off less than the other two as for the eldest boy im sure he piddles around and talks to everybody he sees in the hallway he refuses to be rushed
4546872 in any case zero three and six hardly seems epidemic even if you were responsible for each and every one
4546873 oh what do we know were just guys we could never parent like a woman its foolish to even try so what happened to you that you wanted to tell me about
4546874 now ossetians are running around and killing poor georgians in their enclaves
4546875 freedoms untidy and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things
4546876 theyre also free to live their lives and do wonderful things and thats whats going to happen here
4546877 i spoke to the americans and they refused to protect the institution were not police and thats not our job they said
4546878 the fact that the looting is happening in nasiriya is a sad event however coalition forces are not a police force coalition forces have no orders to protect universities they have orders to protect places of interest such as hospitals museums and banks
4546879 iraqis need to protect their own cities coalition forces will help the iraqi people police themselves for example in al kut where people are cooperating with coalition forces they have stood up a city police force the coalition has even provided arms for the local police force iraqis will run iraq and they will govern themselves

4546919 as modern people we usually think of an idol as an animal or human figure made of stone or wood we see it as an object for religious devotion or magical power for premodern people who might prostrate themselves on the ground before it if we have updated the idea at all we might use idolatry to describe someones obsessional preoccupations with money or of an idol like elvis presley we have in effect distanced ourselves from the whole idea of idolatry by pushing it out to the extreme cultural and psychological margins of life this distance has produced two problems first we misunderstand the most comprehensive description of the shape of unbelief used by the writers of the bible if we as christians today see idolatry only at lifes margins we will be ill equipped to use this powerful critical tool as the apostles and prophets did to understand and challenge the surrounding world the second problem is similar to the first but even more important if we do not understand the nature of idolatry we will not be able to recognize or guard against it in our own lives and communities overlooking idolatry makes us blind toward our own problems idols are not just on pagan altars but in well educated hearts and minds the apostle paul associates the dynamics of human greed lust craving and coveting with idolatry ephesians 5 5 colossians 3 5 the bible does not allow us to marginalize idolatry to the fringes of life all too often it is found on center stage
4546920 idolatry is the most discussed problem in the bible and one of the most powerful spiritual and intellectual concepts in the believers arsenal yet for christians today it is one of the least meaningful notions and is surrounded with ironies perhaps this is why many evangelicals are ignorant of the idols in their lives contemporary evangelicals are little better at recognizing and resisting idols than modern secular people are there can be no believing communities without an unswerving eye to the detection and destruction of idols
4546921 sometimes the object of desire itself is evil e g to kill someone to steal to control the cocaine trade in philadelphia but often the object of desire is good and the evil lies in the lordship of the desire our will replaces gods as that which determines how we live natural affections for any good thing become inordinate ruling cravings we are meant to be ruled by godly passions and desires natural desires for good things are meant to exist subordinate to our desire to please the giver of gifts the fact that the evil lies in the ruling status of the desire not the object is frequently a turning point in counseling consider this example a woman commits adultery and repents she and her husband rebuild the marriage painstakingly patiently eight months later the man finds himself plagued with subtle suspiciousness the wife senses it and feels a bit like she lives under fbi surveillance the husband is grieved by his suspiciousness because he has no objective reasons for suspicion ive forgiven her weve rebuilt our marriage weve never communicated better why do i hold onto this mistrust what finally emerges is that he is willing to forgive the past but he is attempting to control the future his craving could be stated this way i want to guarantee that betrayal never ever happens again the very intensity of his craving starts to poison the relationship it places him in the stance of continually evaluating and judging his wife rather than loving her what he wants cannot be guaranteed this side of heaven he sees the point sees his inordinate desire to ensure the future but he bursts out whats wrong with wanting my wife to love me whats wrong with wanting her to remain faithful to our marriage here is where this truth is so sweet there is nothing wrong with the object of desire there is everything wrong when it rules his life the process of restoring that marriage took a long step forward as he grapsed a lesson his shepherd had for him
4546922 the things frequently labeled co dependency are more precisely instances of co idolatry peoples typical idol patterns often reinforce each other and fit in an uncanny way into a single large idol system creating massively destructive feedback loops the classic alcoholic husband and rescuing wife are enslaved within an idol system whose components complement each other all too well 1 the idol pattern in the husband might be a use of alcohol a to serve an idol of escape from the pains and frustrations in life or b to serve an idol of self crucifixion to deal with his periodic guilt and remorse 2 the idol pattern in the wife might be a use of rescuing behavior a to serve an idol of personal worth by being a martyred savior of her family or b to serve an idol of security by having a males love and dependence on her each of their idols and the consequent behavior thoughts and emotions is logical within the idol system idols counterfeit aspects of gods identity and character judge savior source of blessing sin bearer object of trust each idol in the system makes promises and gives warnings service to each idol results in a hangover of misery and accusedness because idols lie and murder they are continually insinuated by the one who is a liar and murderer from the beginning
4546923 an idol is not simply a statue of wood stone or metal it is anything we love and pursue in place of god and can also be referred to as a false god or a functional god in biblical terms an idol is something other than god that we set our hearts on luke 12 29 1 cor 10 6 that motivates us 1 cor 4 5 that masters or rules us ps 119 133 or that we serve matt 6 24
4546924 your idols define good and evil in ways contrary to gods definitions
4546925 at the end of exodus 20 23 the lord says you shall make no covenant with them pagan peoples or with their gods
4546926 an idol is something within creation that is inflated to function as god all sorts of things are potential idols depending only on our attitudes and actions toward them idolatry may not involve explicit denials of gods existence or character it may well come in the form of an over attachment to something that is in itself perfectly good an idol can be a physical object a property a person an activity a role an institution a hope an image an idea a pleasure a hero anything that can substitute for god
4546927 each person acts as if god could not make him happy without the addition of something else
4546928 the evil in our desire typically does not lie in what we want but that we want it too much
4546929 the principle crime of the human race the highest guilt charged upon the world the whole procuring cause of judgment is idolatry for although each individual sin retains its own proper feature although it is destined to judgment under its own proper name also yet they all fall under the general heading of idolatry all murder and adultery for example are idolatry for they arise because something is loved more than god yet in turn all idolatry is murder for it assaults god and all idolatry is also adultery for it is unfaithfulness to god thus it comes to pass that in idolatry all crimes are detected and in all crimes idolatry
4546930 the virtues on which the mind preens itself as giving control over the body and its urges and which aim at any other purpose or possession than god are in point of fact vices rather than virtues
4546931 an idol is when we make a good thing into an ultimate thing

4546978 discuss ed the findings of steven jones physicist and hero of the 9 11 truth movement who claims to have evidence that the world trade center towers collapsed due to explosives inside the building not just the planes hitting them during the attacks
4546979 a forum for those who take a deeply skeptical view of government claims about the attacks

4546981 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced
4546982 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust

4547082 whether we have arrived at this point in time by a superior technological approach sheer luck or a redneck can do attitude the fact remains that microalgae can outperform the current feedstocks utilized for conversion to biodiesel and ethanol yet do not impact the consumable food markets or fresh water resources
4547083 although it was an honor to be selected as a team member with such an elite group of companies petrosun has chosen to go down a separate path in order to expedite the potential of algae being processed into a commercial jet fuel
4547084 the darpa program has been stalled due to a protest that was filed on may 29th by a firm that was excluded from the darpa decision our withdrawal was prompted by the uncertainty of the award process combined with an opportunity to initiate a project with a renewable fuel refiner and a commercial jet fuel end user petrosuns corporate position acknowledges a true sense of urgency to prove that algae to biofuels can become an immediate part of the solution for our nations energy independence
4547085 it seems very clear to me this year that the unfortunate practice of paying circulators by the signature seems to directly correlate to the significant amount of bad signatures being collected
4547086 as i have called for in the past the legislature should look closely at this problem and at the problem of privately funded voter registration drives that arent properly getting people registered
4547087 in the end both of these problems are negatively affecting this years petition process as being among the largest failure rates in the history of our state
4547088 the verifying process of checking millions of petition signatures is something my office takes very seriously in compliance with the arizona revised statutes
4547089 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4547090 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4547091 camryns 9 year old sister tabatha asked why he needed a bath now

4547098 the olympic viewer will be able to define his or her own olympic experience like never before
4547099 nbc is certainly taking the right approach by stepping back and trying to look at the olympics as a holistic suite of video offerings and then trying to figure out what pieces best go where
4547100 i have no idea how people are going to use this stuff
4547101 there are a lot of different companies supporting different file formats

4547103 but not really a friendly one for consumers i think
4547104 weve moved from tv on this biggest screen to tv on this middle screen
4547105 thats the fastest growing segment of whos watching tv content
4547106 its the most overrated overhyped story in the tech world today
4547107 people like routine they like to able to know what is going to be on at 8 oclock

4547132 por isso necess rio cumprir urgentemente o plano de seis pontos
4547133 cada caso deve ser analisado separadamente mas nem toda localidade que deseja sair da uni o com um estado capaz de se transformar em um estado independente se fosse assim haveria muitos problemas no mundo o princ pio deve ser a integridade territorial

4547136 parece que o senhor presidente georgiano mikhail saakashvili se cansou da diplomacia e simplesmente decidiu esfaquear os sul ossetas que lhe incomodavam para puni los

4547164 this is the first time weve seen the base excited in a long time
4547165 the republican base was ready for somebody to stand up and say to the democrats were not going to take it anymore
4547166 westmoreland faces an underfunded and little known democratic challenger attorney stephen camp of newnan for the 3rd congressional district seat
4547167 jim marshall and john barrow can go back to their districts and talk about how conservative they are but their first vote in the new 111th congress will be to turn the keys of the country back to someone from that liberal mentality
4547168 and i think there are some americans who might think thats not such a good idea
4547169 the whole energy debate shows theres a crisis of leadership starting with the speaker right on down through her regime thats running the house

4547172 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
4547173 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use
4547174 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it except copy it
4547175 we take our intellectual property seriously and are considering appropriate action on this matter
4547176 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations

4547180 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4547181 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4547182 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4547183 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4547184 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4547185 you are dealing with a people who despise anything human
4547186 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4547187 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4547188 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4547189 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4547190 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected

4547193 my role was to keep the sessions moving and to provoke discussion and responses
4547194 but it was birch bayh who provided the foundation for these discussions because of his own love for the legislative machinery of government and his mastery of policy and political success even when the cards were frequently stacked against him and the causes he fought for

4547198 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4547199 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4547200 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4547201 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4547202 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4547203 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4547204 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4547205 this was the highest new enrollment since we started keeping records in 1991
4547206 bonterra trust has been of the opinion that the trust structure is no longer capable of providing maximum value to unitholders
4547207 i think just about all the trusts are candidates for it its just a matter of when
4547208 one of the main advantages to being a trust was the ability to deduct the distributions made to the unitholders and thats what you give up going to the corporate model
4547209 trusts that have more tax pools available to them and dont need to rely as heavily on distributions to shelter tax they will be the ones that will be more inclined to convert sooner rather than later
4547210 the wholesale sealing of the proceedings in these matters is a clear violation
4547211 the main issue is that the opticians are sort of propagating this kind of fear mongering mentality that its dangerous to buy contact lenses from alternative suppliers
4547212 were just trying to make sure that accurrate information is disseminated
4547213 having delivered more than 200 million pairs of replacement contact lenses to our customers world wide we can proudly say that we have never received a report from a customer identifying any health issue of any kind arising from the products we supplied
4547214 consistent with this we note that no regulatory or professional body has ever identified any actual health or safety issues which they allege arose from the products we have supplied to our customers
4547215 prescription contact lenses may only be fitted dispensed and otherwise furnished to members of the public by a qualified eye care professional

4547218 bodes well for overall gdp gross domestic product growth in june returning to positive growth after the disappointing 0 1 per cent drop in may
4547219 going forward activity in manufacturing will be helped by rising new orders particularly for aerospace products and the recent depreciation of the canadian dollar
4547220 this factor is expected to keep the central banks overnight rate unchanged in canada at a still stimulative three per cent through the remainder of this year despite the bank of canada indicating concern about inflation pressures building in the system
4547221 the bottom line is that even in spite of the lower canadian dollar manufacturing sales are likely to remain weak until at least the spring of 2009 when the u s economy begins to show improvement
4547222 its not so bad now as it used to but i remember when they used to come to a community youd have them for a year and then theyd be gone so they never got to know the community they never got to know the people
4547223 now at least we keep them for a couple of years but even thats not enough if youre going to have a police force youve got to have a police force that knows the people and the area
4547224 there are rare occasions that they ask people to stay
4547225 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst
4547226 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4547227 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4547228 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging
4547229 the most riveting thought provoking book ive read in years
4547230 bursting with lessons in faith forgiveness and family it is a modern classic that will be enjoyed and passed along to friends and family for years to come
4547231 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
4547232 the entrenched political and cultural norms that perpetuate male dominated decision making bodies and constrain women
4547233 transitioning government structures which afford particular opportunity for repositioning womens role in public life and decision making
4547234 a lot of laws have not been interpreted or defined in a new country and you can assume that whatever you want the law to be it is unless it is proven otherwise so of course we put the most progressive spin on it
4547235 the more we say it the more people get to believing it were changing the norm first they laugh and then they start repeating it
4547236 to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times
4547237 where individuals grow freely and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them
4547238 what if god thrives on both the pain suffering and the joy experienced by all creatures do i believe in satan no i never really believed in the existence of such a thing to me satan is simply one aspect of god its not a creation of god in the same way we are though perhaps it can take possession of the mind of a created being the aspect of satan can be a useful tool as god uses it in different ways to inflict the pain on man and beast that is his ecstasy or to draw maximum pleasure from the joys also experienced by man and beast god can also use the concept of satan to make us fear because that fear is also one of his great sources of pleasure if we could completely stop all pain and suffering and fear we would undermine gods very existence but of course there is no way we could do that yet if god were really a good loving god as we were led to believe that is exactly what he would want to do relieve all beings including animals plants and whatever else is conscious on some level of suffering fear and pain but look at how the world we know is designed the fear and the pain are built in violence death destruction and chaos conflict its all totally ingrained from the start one being has to kill destroy another in order to be able to survive and isnt there both fear and pain involved doesnt the antelope fear and suffer when the lion pounces on it and tears at its throat its designed that way that is gods nature but if he had natural life evolve to the point where it produced us maybe he wanted to no had to bring in elements of uncertainty i believe there is unpredictability even for god and he needs it or maybe there are many gods and the uncertainty unpredictability arises from that i find it hard though to think of god as not one but many because i grew up believing in a single god so i think anyway that there might be a chance for us to change god and for him to be happy with that because he needs the excitement of not knowing what comes next im making god seem very human but this is because i can only describe him in human terms no human being can really do it otherwise anyway my conclusion is that god is most certainly unworthy of worship though im sure he likes people to worship him just like hitler and stalin etc liked to be worshipped
4547239 when seen from the standpoint of not knowing gods providence we must also regard as evil the israelites invasion of the land of canaan during which they destroyed slaughtered all the gentiles without reason however this was also good when seen from the standpoint of the providence of restoration although there may have been among the canaanites those who were more conscientious than the israelites the canaanites at that time were uniformly on the satanic side while the israelites were uniformly on the heavenly side
4547240 the siuc community dental center is being recognized by me as they have exemplified the very essence of teamwork by joining with others the siuc dental hygiene program and the southern illinois dental society within the dental community the past several years to achieve a common goal within the dental profession that goal being improved access to dental care to patients on limited income within the carbondale community
4547241 the community dental center has been cited several times as an example of a partnership between academia and the dental profession to serve the community and meet the needs of various population groups

4547253 ever since the 1960s washington has gulled its citizens and creditors by debasing official statistics the vital instruments with which the vigor and muscle of the american economy are measured the effect has been to create a false sense of economic achievement and rectitude allowing us to maintain artificially low interest rates massive government borrowing and a dangerous reliance on mortgage and financial debt even as real economic growth has been slower than claimed the truth though it would not exactly set americans free would at least open a window to wider economic and political understanding readers should ask themselves how much angrier the electorate might be if the media over the past five years had been citing 8 percent unemployment instead of 5 percent 5 percent inflation instead of 2 percent and average annual growth in the 1 percent range instead of the 3 4 percent range the real numbers to most economically minded americans would be a face full of cold water based on the criteria in place a quarter century ago todays u s unemployment rate is somewhere between 9 percent and 12 percent the inflation rate is as high as 7 or even 10 percent economic growth since the recession of 2001 has been mediocre despite a huge surge in the wealth and incomes of the superrich and we are falling back into recession
4547254 consumer prices shot up in july at twice the expected rate pushed higher by surging energy and food costs the latest surge left inflation running at the fastest pace in 17 years the labor department reported thursday that consumer prices rose by 0 8 percent last month twice the 0 4 percent gain that economists had been expecting it marked the third straight month of oversized inflation increases following jumps of 0 6 percent in may and 1 1 percent in june and it leaves inflation rising by 5 6 percent over the past year the biggest 12 month gain since january 1991 core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy costs rose 0 3 percent in july slightly higher than the 0 2 percent increase that economists had expected for the past 12 months core inflation has risen by 2 5 percent the highest 12 month change since february the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything
4547255 if you think things are going to get a lot better with the drop in petroleum prices think again the increases in july were broadbased

4547280 bonterra trust s long term business strategy has been to combine its oil and gas production technical strengths with planned business strategies to generate above average results and returns for unitholders
4547281 bonterra trust has been of the opinion that the trust structure is no longer capable of providing maximum value to unitholders
4547282 i think just about all the trusts are candidates for it it s just a matter of when

4547285 there are some good buying opportunities out there right now but in some cases those opportunities would take them over the 20 per cent annual growth limit
4547286 they won t stick in the trust form because it s an unnecessarily complex and burdensome structure
4547287 so why not go back to the traditional model of a corporation but just carry on with the distributions

4547289 is a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world and sometimes in more than one region of the globe at a time
4547290 china is not now a superpower nor is it likely to emerge as one soon
4547291 lots of pretty unattractive policy options considering we dont really want to have war with either russia or china given the fact that were fighting two wars already
4547292 chinas relations with most of its neighbors are pretty good
4547293 it china would rather be on the same side of an international issue than at odds with us
4547294 compared to many other countries including our friends and allies china has been much less critical of u s actions in
4547295 although levels of personal satisfaction are lower and by global standards chinese contentment with family income and jobs is not especially high these findings represent a dramatic improvement in national contentment from earlier in the decade when the chinese people were not nearly as positive about the course of their nation and its economy
4547296 broad acceptance among the chinese of their countrys transformation from a socialist to a
4547297 clear majorities favor having the games in will help chinas image say 93 percent of the chinese surveyed
4547298 for the first time in nearly a century we see leadership in basic research and the economic ability to pursue the benefits of that research to create and market products based on research in more than one place on the planet
4547299 now we have a situation in which technology products are going to be appearing in the marketplace that were not developed or commercialized here we wont have had any involvement with them and may not even know they are coming
4547300 have been dramatic and there is no real sense that any kind of leveling off is occurring
4547301 china has really changed the world economic landscape in technology
4547302 when you take chinas low cost manufacturing and focus on technology then combine them with the increasing emphasis on research and development the result ultimately wont leave much room for other countries
4547303 its like being 40 years old and playing basketball against a competitor whos only 12 years old but is already at your height
4547304 you are a little better right now and have more experience but youre not going to squeeze much more performance out the future clearly doesnt look good for the united states
4547305 these emerging superpowers through the sheer size of their respective populations and coupled with increasing access to education and technology may become contenders for international dominance even before reaching the income per capita levels of the developed nations of today
4547306 chinas behavior during the sars epidemic when it hid what was going on and lied to the international community suggests that it is not ready for that type of leadership
4547307 we saw more openness after the but the fundamental system remains the same
4547308 signal to the rest of the world that china has arrived
4547309 more open more transparent and more tolerant but this will not be achieved overnight it will take time
4547310 but i hope the olympics serve as a wake up call
4547311 china is nowhere close to becoming a world financial center
4547312 dramatic economic growth must continue indefinitely a prospect about which there are grounds for skepticism
4547313 chinas rise further depends critically on the continuation of such economic growth rates and there are reasons to wonder how long the spectacular rates of the past 25 years can continue
4547314 the high proportion of chinas economy occupied by its exports makes it sensitive to the ups and downs of the international economy generally and to the engine of american consumption in particular
4547315 a man may write at any time if he will set himself doggedly to it
4547316 its a device for trapping lions in the scottish highlands
4547317 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4547318 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4547319 i was in high school when she hit it big
4547320 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4547321 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4547322 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4547323 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4547324 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4547325 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4547326 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4547327 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4547328 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4547329 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4547330 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4547331 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4547332 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40
4547333 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4547334 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4547335 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4547336 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4547337 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4547338 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4547339 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4547340 its a nice safe utility but it has to be clean it cant have 3 2 billion in debt on it
4547341 do you hear music when youre talking to me then
4547342 gigaom is reporting on some recent issues with the iphone 3g

4547344 cnn is reporting that the iphone 3g has broken the three million unit marker according to michael cote of the cote collaborative

4547346 in an announcement on tuesday apple made it official that they are bringing itunes movies to australia and new zealand

4547351 this agreement in principle with wachovia if approved by the commission will permit tens of thousands of wachovia investors to get their money back
4547352 because of him we use the term rhythm and blues and we hail ray charles as genius and aretha franklin as queen
4547353 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4547354 i would like to congratulate the maoists for entering multi party competitive politics
4547355 we will stay in opposition and keep an eye on the maoists activities while they run the government we will oppose their actions if their activities incline towards autocracy
4547356 the integration of peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4547357 i am a layman thankful to his church anchored by his faith and his humble background
4547358 im virtually convinced that when fernando lugo finishes his term he will return to religious life
4547359 i have no need of this money which belongs to more humble people
4547360 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4547361 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4547362 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4547363 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4547364 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4547365 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4547366 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4547367 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4547368 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians
4547369 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4547370 the talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4547371 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4547372 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4547373 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4547374 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4547375 anyone who accuses me of reneging on this and that has to ask zimbabweans what they want if i maintain a principled stand to defend the will of the people of zimbabwe whats wrong with that
4547376 if we can continue getting these tough wins then we can win the gold medal
4547377 it doesnt matter if the victories are easy or difficult the important thing is the gold medal
4547378 the game was just like a battle to see whos going to fight to the end
4547379 and like a gamble to see whos going to win
4547380 i would like everything to count at this class it should count for something

4547386 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim

4547416 its a privilege to have the leadership of such a reputable club
4547417 our greatest ongoing success as a club is keeping it going after all these years
4547418 the best thing about the team was the friendly camaraderie after the games both within our own team and with the opposition
4547419 after games we used to retire to the bel air street armoury for a few drinks
4547420 my best single experience so far was my first full game it was hard work but very rewarding at the end
4547421 after the first practice you have 20 new friends we make players feel welcome and we get them drunk
4547422 grabbed me by the shirt and pushed me up against the wall a soldier tried to help but she pushed him away and he fell down she held me with one hand and with the other pushed a rock into my mouth and forced my mouth closed i felt my teeth breaking

4547430 coming to the center gave me a chance to do something
4547431 there is so much enthusiasm from the students as they attend class and prepare their final projects
4547432 i think it stands to show what a positive impact that imc is making in akkar through these centers on a daily basis
4547433 both female and male former combatants who experienced sexual violence had worse mental health outcomes than non combatants and other former combatants who did not experience exposure to sexual violence
4547434 like their female counterparts male former combatants who experienced sexual violence have worse mental health outcomes than both the general population and also other former combatants
4547435 this unexpected finding suggests that standard post conflict rehabilitation programs and gender based programs will need to adjust current programming to take into account males who have experienced sexual violence especially former combatants
4547436 stigma around the issues documented in the study remains high
4547437 so a public mental health approach is essential given the continuing problems of this and other sexual and gender based violence sgbv indicators cited in the study mental health service provision should be combined with sgbv education and prevention campaigns integrating livelihoods and literacy programs will also be a critical step in helping these populations recover and rebuild
4547438 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this

4547446 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4547447 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4547448 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4547449 uncertainty about the companys ability to continue as a going concern

4547453 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4547454 as far as the numbers game is concerned it is all over
4547455 so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4547456 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4547457 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations

4547475 we are nearing the one year anniversary of the killing of 17 civilians by security contractors at nisour square in iraq and not a single one of those responsible has been held accountable because of a gap in u s law
4547476 the decision by the administration to block it in the senate is a serious affront to the rule of law and to the efforts of our military service members in iraq
4547477 its incredibly complicated to apply civilian law 7 000 miles away and in the context of a war zone
4547478 you have to consider rules of engagement and decisions made in a battle situation you have to get evidence and witness testimony from 7 000 miles away theres really no legal precedent that says this would work
4547479 using the ucmj to prosecute civilians even during a war may generate constitutional challenges based on the standards of due process applicable to military courts
4547480 was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final rfp that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be required for the evolving mission over the next several decades
4547481 both are working very hard to drive nationwide market share through a series of local market share moves
4547482 is excellent and is one that would take a decade or more for cvs to replicate through organic growth
4547483 we have a much healthier hospital and health care industry than we had a few years ago
4547484 so these reductions in the rate of growth are being asked from providers who now have positive margins
4547485 i just dont think were in an era where you can lock down a budget jan 1 and say were not changing it we have to continue to look at budgets throughout the year
4547486 the hospitals are just going to have to reopen those budgets and make considerations
4547487 the berger changes create the opportunity for a much stronger system
4547488 did facebook and blockbuster violate a video privacy law when movie choices made by facebook members were made available to others
4547489 im surprised that there havent been lawsuits already in terms of blockbuster
4547490 a class action lawsuit filed earlier this week targets facebook and eight of the participants in beacon its ill fated advertising product that shared information about third party site activity with the social network
4547491 the set of 20 plaintiffs mostly residents of texas filed the suit in the u s district court for the northern district of california on tuesday
4547492 named as defendants are facebook as well as current or former beacon participants blockbuster fandango owned by comcast overstock com sta travel zappos hotwire owned by iac interactivecorp and gamefly
4547493 and that its legal team consequently did not have a formal statement at the time
4547494 there can not be a more arrogant doc anywhere in any er
4547495 he should really be locked up and the key thrown away and maybe for good measure injected with something really nasty
4547496 burned a cd for friends of the songs he was the most proud of from his half century career in music
4547497 do you know ive actually had in a weird way a fantastic year to be honest we did a sell out tour which was an unbelievable experience to play the o2 you cant describe that feeling so then to roll on to this is probably one of the best years ive ever had ironically
4547498 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools

4547500 some would say that justice is the answer and indeed we should always seek justice however we know that in a flawed and broken world complete justice is hardly ever experienced
4547501 we do not live in a world where we can experience absolute justice with justice as with so many other things in life we frequently have to settle for something less than the absolute
4547502 we all share in the pain and frustration which this particularly brings to the families of those whose lives were taken
4547503 so today and across this weekend it is truly fitting we remember the cruel events of ten years ago that we remember everyone who was killed or hurt that we honour their memory today and always
4547504 sadly omagh 1998 will always be remembered for the horrific loss of innocent life and the terrible suffering caused to so many but the way that its people responded to that tragedy will also mark omagh 1998 as a monument to the triumph of hope over despair and to the reality that a truly new dawn had finally broken in ireland
4547505 it is the crass stupidity of the defendant which is the graveness of the offence it was the height of madness to do what he did

4547509 he is genuinely sorry for what happened he knows he cannot take back what happened
4547510 he will be able to do his time and come out we have got a life sentence i want him to see what he has done i hope he rots
4547511 people need to know machines like this are not toys

4547513 having cancer should not cost you your home but as many as 45 000 people each year are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and 15 000 have lost their homes
4547514 eligibility rules for chronic conditions for example can sometimes mean cancer treatments will effectively be excluded or cut short
4547515 i am very very happy to be here im glad to have signed for the club
4547516 i want to do everything i can to repay the faith that the chairman and gaffer jefferies have shown in me
4547517 he impressed us right away in the two or three days that he was with us

4547615 other countries such as australia canada japan and many european countries have successfully introduced a similar denomination coin but only by phasing out the note of the same value

4547648 i hope it is a message that says the world is noticing your actions
4547649 i dont want to put a time frame on how far we have stepped back but clearly this is a freeze on this type of progress with russia
4547650 its very exciting for us because we think it represents more than just a number
4547651 it represents a new era of ballparks what camden yards did for baltimore for maryland and even for the entire country really changed the way baseball ballparks were built
4547652 putting it in the heart of the city where theres all kinds of things to do downtown within walking distance was unheard of when camden yards was proposed and built and then you see a wave of ballparks that mirror that not only from an aesthetic standpoint but from a practicality standpoint fifty million fans in 17 seasons really proves what a success orioles park has been for the community
4547653 the maryland lottery is thrilled to be a part of these historic moments
4547654 it is an honor to help the orioles celebrate the rich history and tradition of major league baseball in maryland
4547655 were going to use the technology available to us to designate a 50 millionth fan the moment the 50 millionth fan enters the ballpark
4547656 it will be based on turnstile count and essentially its being in the right place at the right time were ready to go to whatever entrance our technology tells us that the 50 millionth fan entered
4547657 the kids love it and the dads really love it
4547658 we have father son weekends and they come down and they really love to play there they try to hit home runs and actually we have one dad who the last four or five years hes been coming every year he has like eight or nine home runs hes the all time home run hitter there
4547659 a lot of them come to the school and think im dead but i think it made an impact overall over the years as far as the school and the recognition of the school
4547660 she does the overhand pitching does very well with it she probably hit close to 600 for all stars she handles her own with the boys
4547661 i do a baseball game in the morning then go to austin to watch haven cheer for a cheer competition
4547662 theyve been in galveston before san antonio its fun to go watch them do that its pretty interesting
4547663 its hard to watch because i want to be out there
4547664 but i take the kids they will both go and watch them they want to go sarah likes to go more than haven
4547665 thats possibly in the future i talked to astros hitting coach sean berry hes a real good friend of mine and i know dewey robinson he was my first pitching coach when i was drafted by the white sox but i talked to sean a teeny bit about how to do it
4547666 but with these kids these days theyve got so many activities that im running all over
4547667 were mostly offset by gains in expected real sales business conditions and the percent of owners saying this is a good time to expand
4547668 in a statement at the white house president george w bush accused russia of
4547669 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4547670 as russian forces started to hand over control of the georgian town of gori yesterday you could detect a note of surprise even disappointment in many media reports
4547671 we welcome all investors and are focused on enhancing value for all shareholders
4547672 there are two olympic games going on here theres the smiley ni hao welcome to beijing birds nest games and then theres the other slightly sinister rumour laden you are being watched sanitised games
4547673 my job as an investigative reporter is to pursue issues that i think are true or merit investigation and report the findings as i find them
4547674 rather than worry about a politically correct investigation that might win favor with politically correct groups that are considered respectable my aim is pursuing the truth of the investigations wherever they lead me
4547675 what motivated the book started with the fact that obama was generally unknown to the public
4547676 he is probably the least vetted presidential candidate weve had in modern times
4547677 become so enamored with barack obama that it has neglected to do the traditional investigative journalist duty which is to investigate critically
4547678 all critical evaluation of obama was not only dropped but those who opposed obama were daring to go do that knowing theyd be abused like i have
4547679 since the time of aristotle ad hominem attacks have been considered fallacious arguments in debate
4547680 the campaign is doing to me what they charge me as doing to them
4547681 world net daily where i am a staff reporter our editorial discipline is that we state our convictions we openly write editorials and commentary as well as do news analysis
4547682 i make it clear that i am opposed to obamas candidacy and lay out the reasons why what i expect is that the public will read that and make up their own minds
4547683 threshold is a small line publishing books and authors on the conservative continuum from libertarian to religious to intellectual to historical
4547684 what we decidedly do not do is work with or for any campaign or party despite the impression the press is leaving i personally while a committed conservative have not worked for a campaign or the party since 1992 including this cycle
4547685 with what i know about social networks if google goes social i will kick your ass
4547686 what is google doing and who can pull out the defacto info product when then time comes you me or howie
4547687 very serious diggers that all share what we learn and it is pretty private
4547688 slotting tries to set a value on what the player is worth based on where hes drafted and i like it
4547689 it gives you some type of value that you think is right and fair for that pick i know players and agents dont care for it but there has to be a number thats fair and equitable
4547690 its good to have guidelines and thats what this system really is a series of guidelines to help create some sense of equity
4547691 if youre a little kid and your mom says dont you dare take any cookies out of the cookie jar youre going to test her to see what happens right
4547692 well lets say you take a cookie and mom catches you red handed but she doesnt do anything to you but say bad boy thats going to stop you from going for another cookie in 10 minutes i dont think so
4547693 its up to each individual organization to decide what theyre willing to pay the players that they draft
4547694 so at the end of the day royals owners dave and dan glass will decide what our budget is to sign players and its up to our baseball operations department to get those players signed within that budget
4547695 a hard slot is the ideal if its hard its hard teams cant even be tempted to go over slot the slot is the slot and the player takes it or pumps gas but that probably wont ever fly with the players union so at least punish the teams for going over slot
4547696 and ownership was willing and supportive of that upward shift
4547697 i want to say it was the low 3 million i dont know exactly what it was i dont think it was quite 3 5 maybe 3 2 3 25 maybe
4547698 i think the bonus money the financial packages that clubs have available to them to sign players should be more than enough to entice a player to sign a professional contract
4547699 a lot of clubs go outside the slotting and so have we on occasion but you have to ask for permission from ownership and mlb to do that
4547700 we went above the slotting price for 2004 third rounder matt tuisosopo and just did the same thing with our 14th round pick luke burnett he was projected to be a second or third round choice but he had tendinitis going into the draft so we went above the slotting amount
4547701 you always try to be fair with all of your draft picks
4547702 if we had the nba rookie thing hed have gone one two or three no question about it
4547703 but how high can you go financially obviously 26 teams decided they couldnt go as high as the tigers went
4547704 when we talk about recommended slots we adhere to that but there are cases we think are special talents and circumstances where you make a decision that you think is best for our organization
4547705 we drafted who we thought were the best players available at the time in which we selected it was not for any reason other than those were the best guys that we thought at the time that we were selecting what other clubs do is kind of all up to them our philosophy is to take the best player available at the time of course when i say that you also weigh in if you think somebodys asking for exorbitantly more money than what you would think hes worth that does weigh into it too but thats what our philosophy is
4547706 well thats more of a major league baseball question i think
4547707 really at this time as ive said all along theyve been guidelines thats different than slotting if you have mandatory slotting thats a whole different system
4547708 but were not going to take every dollar that this club has at its disposal this year and will next year
4547709 given the discussions with his representative the thought is that the best deal is going to come in those final minutes before the deadline but at some point we are going to have to make a decision regarding where our money is best spent
4547710 if its hard its hard teams cant even be tempted to go over slot the slot is the slot and the player takes it or pumps gas but that probably wont ever fly with the players union so at least punish the teams for going over slot
4547711 if youre as good as your advisor is saying you are youll get your money down the road
4547712 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important friggin information
4547713 a general fund increase based on enrollment rates that were positive for last year generates an increase to the general funds of about 945 000
4547714 that seems like a lot but if you take a look at where that money goes it is all pre designated to special funds
4547715 we will still get the money for the general fund but we will not receive the money in the operating budget
4547716 we will probably get in the neighborhood of 300 000 for general fund authority for this year we will know exactly what that is when we go through an audit
4547717 thats funding by local tax levies and its the same in every school district
4547718 we need to set some money aside and not plan to build a spending increased budget
4547719 we are putting that aside as a reserve in case we dont get full funding down the road
4547720 we dont know what the enrollment rates are going to be in the future so this is in case the enrollment rate goes down
4547721 we will still have one of the lowest mill levies
4547722 we want to create a reserve fund so were prepared and know whats happening
4547723 we need to make sure we do what we can
4547724 i wanted to give you some sense of why we need to create some reserve in the budget
4547725 we want to analyze operational systems around consumption of utilities to find places to operate more efficiently
4547726 weve been providing this assistance to cities and municipalities since 2005 the improvements are designed to provide utility and operational savings
4547727 ultimately you the customer choose the equipment and choose the contractor you want to work with
4547728 we added some things that will not ever pay for themselves
4547729 the place that is the hottest is where our firefighters sleep
4547730 we included them even though we have abundant water in el dorado
4547731 that wont always be the case and we think we ought to be conservation minded
4547732 we have been recognized as the largest deliverer of energy efficiency in the u s
4547733 the key element of our business is we have a national regional team that is focused on working with the city of el dorado
4547734 we have been working with the city staff for the last several months trying to deliver this project
4547735 we started off with analyzing utility bills from there we got a feel of how much you are consuming
4547736 my concern is we dont control the cost of fuel
4547737 i see the possibility even though we reduce energy use the cost could go up if energy costs double
4547738 we analyzed your bills for the calendar year of 2007
4547739 based on the rates that were applicable for gas and electric we have used those rates and they would be applicable for the entire duration of the project for ongoing increasing energy costs we are using escalating energy cost factors
4547740 unless there is angst among the commission it is my intention to move forward with this
4547741 im in favor of being conservative theres just so many things we need is this going to be one of the things we need right now
4547742 the units at the civic center are going to fail
4547743 the units here are on borrowed time if i thought there was any real useful life left on the hvac units i wouldnt be asking you to do it
4547744 it gives the kids experience in just a lot of different law enforcement areas
4547745 it gives them a chance to meet posts from all across the country some are small like el dorado and others are huge like new york pd
4547746 we cannot get the national level education they provide at these conferences here in el dorado
4547747 these conferences develop a new excitement in our youth for picking law enforcement as a career field
4547748 a lot of our kids have less than six months on the post so they were pretty green
4547749 by going and competing in this conference they get feedback from other people than just spivey and i when you have someone from the dea or fbi they tend to take more from it
4547750 it is a lot of money and effort to get to come to these conferences but it is worth the hard work
4547751 it is an experience in law enforcement our youth will never forget
4547752 we came here to compete and have fun and learn
4547753 it helps give kids who may be interested in law enforcement exposure to it in a positive way very early
4547754 its something that if they they like it if they enter when they are 14 and by the time they turn 21 they have seven years exposure to law enforcement in a positive light
4547755 never seen anything like this in my career for software
4547756 the relative security of basra is said to owe more to the dominance of militias and criminal gangs who are said to have achieved a fragile balance in the city
4547757 local people have got better things to do now with their lives and i do not see basra coming back under militia control those days are passed
4547758 a few months ago some people tried to hold large parties in the city
4547759 they had a band which was playing music but they had to stop when they were attacked by the militias
4547760 there have already been a couple of assassination attempts against political and religious figures in basra
4547761 all the local people have bad relations with the politicians
4547762 everyone knows that they are stealing money when the roads are resurfaced the quality of the tarmac is very bad we are seeing a big robbery
4547763 having an important role in a balanced and diversified financial sector
4547764 what does someone have to do around here to get respect
4547765 if ye love wealth greater than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest for freedom go home and leave us in peace we seek not your council nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen
4547766 shame olmert cant be tried along with the knesset for their abysmal and shameful behavior during the last few years what charges you ask oh the same ones we should issue to pelosi and her cronies sedition treason aiding and abetting an enemy
4547767 only if i look for the extraordinary in the ordinary will i see it and when i do look i see it all around me g d has given us so much to be grateful for so much to be in awe about life is precious and extraordinary and i have learned to live and love this day as if it were my last
4547768 illegal immigration is an illicit employer problem rather than an illegal alien problem that said our current porous border policy also allows many people who come here for nefarious reasons to cross into this country and that is a national security problem
4547769 and no matter which of the three of them wins were going to have a more socialized government the difference is one of degree not kind
4547770 as a progressive party democrats will bring you change by using government to enhance revenues from the rich to invest in the production of energy and green collar jobs and by using diplomacy to engage americas enemies and end the iraq war
4547771 as a regressive party democrats will bring you the 1970s by using socialism to raise taxes from you to waste in the production of lethargy and unemployment and by using magic to appease americas enemies and lose the iraq war
4547772 lets make this absolutely clear guns do not cause crime liberalism does
4547773 a legally applied for and approved concealed carry permit enables a law abiding citizen to do one thing following all the bureacratic invasive hoop jumping he may now conceal a loaded firearm on his person for the purpose of self protection without fearing incarceration by the police for breaking a state law against unlicensed carry that our second amendment already superceded and nullified
4547774 too far gone cant be fixed bigger than we can any longer influence
4547775 hush you dissenters wither submit its our manners or your radicalism have you not heard of our offered two choices be reasonable be quiet be still legislation will give us the equality of utterance that amendment one never provided
4547776 see there another gift of queen nancy behold her fair care doctrine wet your tongues and lips her feet require bathing tis it not the very least we should do she has such walking remaining we need only pave her road with ourselves
4547777 he cant go to the park and play with friends
4547778 and we didnt have anything for them to play with here
4547779 i prefer this to being on national television and getting all that publicity
4547780 el secreto del xito en la vida del hombre consiste en estar dispuesto para aprovechar la ocasi n que se le depare
4547781 in time every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out his duties work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence
4547782 whatever personal word or assurance there might have been between them has been eroded
4547783 i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
4547784 the era in which the united states and russia saw each other as an enemy or strategic threat has ended
4547785 it sure is wonderful to be here with my friend
4547786 roosevelt felt this way about stalin who he called uncle joe
4547787 clinton had this feeling about yeltsin reagan felt this way with gorbachev they all felt that they had a special relationship with the soviet and russian leaders but when it comes to defining national interests the personal relationship is not very important
4547788 he was one of the last holdouts in his administration as russian policies began to harden
4547789 you cant conduct the business of two major powers just on handshakes and personal relations
4547790 the u s russia relationship tends to be very labor intensive at the presidential level
4547791 without the focus from bush and putin from the top it drifted and went into a downhill slide
4547792 to re establish kremlin control of the political and economic power levers
4547793 the whole question of national sovereignty and international law is more muddled than it was a decade ago and the united states is partly to blame for the confusion
4547794 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4547795 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4547796 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4547797 blah blah blah writers strike blah blah blah need more scripts blah blah blah good opening weekend blah blah blah
4547798 the worlds youth have a huge personal stake in global warming
4547799 after all it is our future that hangs in the balance the inconvenient youth network will give a voice to the many youth around the world who want to make difference now
4547800 we believe the climate change problem can be solved and youth will make a difference this group of 80 trainees will tap into their local communities and quickly grow to a network of over a thousand youth were already working to schedule sessions at campuses across the nation
4547801 were going beyond facebook to get this issue in the face of adults and other teens together we can solve it
4547802 i can tell you from my experience that most of the time media speculation turns out to be wrong
4547803 im staying as governor whether you like it or not
4547804 the lieutenant governor might not like it very much but im staying
4547805 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4547806 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4547807 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4547808 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4547809 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4547810 i want them to know i am sorry it has taken a great toll on them
4547811 somewhere along the way i lost my path i made horrible decisions
4547812 this is a sad case its obvious that you have good skills
4547813 you destroyed the most valuable asset that you possess your good name
4547814 he was not saying oh im sorry i was arrested
4547815 his crime wasnt just ripping people off hes left a trail of devastation in his wake boarded up buildings are going to stay that way for years to come thats what hes done for his community
4547816 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
4547817 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
4547818 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
4547819 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
4547820 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4547821 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4547822 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4547823 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4547824 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4547825 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4547826 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4547827 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4547828 this rally will be part of a massive outpouring of protest in denver and minneapolis against the two corporate controlled parties and their policies of perpetual militarism and war
4547829 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4547830 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4547831 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4547832 kids today have been given everything they want and dont have to work for it they have no respect for authority
4547833 theyll make remarks right to the face of the mall cops i get to the point where i want to do something
4547834 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
4547835 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
4547836 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
4547837 kids want to think for themselves they dont care what mom and dad say
4547838 this was a republican stronghold but its changing very quickly because its mom and dad youre republican so i aint ever going to be one of them
4547839 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4547840 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4547841 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4547842 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4547843 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4547844 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4547845 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4547846 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4547847 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4547848 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4547849 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4547850 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4547851 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4547852 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4547853 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4547854 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4547855 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4547856 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4547857 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4547858 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4547859 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4547860 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4547861 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4547862 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4547863 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4547864 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4547865 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4547866 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4547867 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4547868 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4547869 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4547870 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4547871 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4547872 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4547873 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4547874 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4547875 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4547876 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4547877 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4547878 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4547879 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4547880 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4547881 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4547882 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4547883 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4547884 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4547885 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4547886 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4547887 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4547888 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4547889 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4547890 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4547891 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4547892 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4547893 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4547894 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4547895 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4547896 if you love her so much how could you do that to her do you even know what the meaning of love is
4547897 if theres anything else you want to say say it now
4547898 still there are a few high profile names outstanding al gores most of all though a democratic involved in planning
4547899 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4547900 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4547901 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4547902 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4547903 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4547904 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4547905 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4547906 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4547907 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4547908 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4547909 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4547910 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4547911 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4547912 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4547913 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4547914 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4547915 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4547916 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4547917 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4547918 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4547919 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4547920 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4547921 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4547922 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4547923 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4547924 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4547925 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4547926 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4547927 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4547928 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4547929 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4547930 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4547931 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4547932 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4547933 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4547934 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4547935 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4547936 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4547937 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4547938 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4547939 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4547940 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4547941 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4547942 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4547943 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4547944 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4547945 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4547946 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4547947 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4547948 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4547949 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4547950 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4547951 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4547952 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4547953 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4547954 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4547955 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4547956 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4547957 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4547958 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4547959 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4547960 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4547961 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4547962 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4547963 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4547964 ya se la hice de una foto m a es un filtro de fotochop
4547965 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4547966 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4547967 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4547968 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4547969 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4547970 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4547971 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4547972 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4547973 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4547974 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4547975 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4547976 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4547977 what do you want your look to say to people
4547978 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4547979 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4547980 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4547981 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4547982 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4547983 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4547984 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4547985 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives
4547986 held on 260 000 00 bond on charges including cocaine possession attempt to sell cocaine and traffic charges
4547987 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4547988 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4547989 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4547990 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4547991 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4547992 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4547993 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4547994 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4547995 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4547996 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4547997 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4547998 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4547999 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4548000 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4548001 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4548002 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4548003 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4548004 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4548005 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4548006 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4548007 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4548008 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4548009 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4548010 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4548011 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4548012 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4548013 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4548014 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4548015 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4548016 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4548017 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4548018 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4548019 it isnt exact thats one we talked about it has to be exact
4548020 to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth
4548021 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the
4548022 while being a parliamentary secretary for three years was interesting it was interesting in the way being governor of syria in the roman empire was interesting you wouldnt knock it back but you could think of postings to which you would rather be appointed
4548023 people were making subtle and not so subtle remarks about what they worried i would speak on indigenous australians hanson politics i was getting messages left right and centre about what i shouldnt say i was being warned effectively
4548024 you can be as empathetic as you like you can have any amount of listening tours and you can invite everyone to say something the perception will be that you listen but eventually you have to make a decision a decision that might alienate half the people youve listened to
4548025 like me or loathe me you know what i stand for
4548026 he offered middle australia the opportunity to get financial security and after the massacre at port arthur which had a huge impact personal security
4548027 the road map the agenda if you like that we came into government with in 1996 had almost been fully realised there was a sense the government had run out of inspiration
4548028 if you factor in non cash benefits provided by the government the figures would tilt even more in favour of thepoor
4548029 all the things we fretted about 10 years ago like unemployment the collapse of traditional industries multiculturalism immigration we had moved on from partly because government policy had changed things in ways that made people feel better these were not a problem any more but this means that other issues come up for people to be less contented about
4548030 david hickss dad stood there and told it like it was
4548031 it didnt come up in the election when hicks was released it was away overnight but it fed into a perception that we lacked compassion like multiculturalism some of our reactions toterrorism security legislation and not signing kyoto
4548032 the fact that we didnt ratify kyoto was interpreted by a lot of people as meaning we were blind to the serious dangers confronting us in the future which would impact on our children
4548033 we hit those families particularly the single mums with the child support changes that came into effect on july 1 2008 which is basically a reduction in the money to be paid by the father its terrible and i fought against that welfare to work was the right thing to do but it was severely affected by the timing and the third issue was work choices the ads were deceitful but it didnt matter
4548034 he got it wrong and he knew he got it wrong
4548035 not even mal brough minister for indigenous affairs knew about that speech it was a desperate attempt to correct history
4548036 as a political movement we are thought to have a good head but a suspect heart
4548037 do any of the parishioners of mary magdalene parish in rose bay feel they are jointly and separately liable for the sacking of constantinople of course they dont
4548038 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4548039 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4548040 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4548041 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4548042 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4548043 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4548044 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4548045 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4548046 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4548047 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4548048 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4548049 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4548050 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4548051 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4548052 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4548053 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4548054 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4548055 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4548056 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4548057 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4548058 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4548059 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4548060 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4548061 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4548062 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4548063 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4548064 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4548065 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4548066 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4548067 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4548068 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4548069 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4548070 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4548071 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4548072 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4548073 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4548074 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4548075 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4548076 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4548077 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4548078 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4548079 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4548080 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4548081 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4548082 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4548083 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4548084 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4548085 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4548086 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4548087 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4548088 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4548089 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4548090 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4548091 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4548092 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4548093 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4548094 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4548095 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4548096 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4548097 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4548098 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4548099 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4548100 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4548101 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4548102 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4548103 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4548104 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4548105 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4548106 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4548107 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4548108 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4548109 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4548110 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4548111 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4548112 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4548113 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4548114 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4548115 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4548116 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4548117 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4548118 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4548119 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

4548121 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
4548122 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
4548123 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
4548124 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
4548125 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
4548126 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
4548127 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
4548128 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
4548129 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
4548130 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
4548131 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
4548132 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
4548133 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
4548134 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
4548135 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
4548136 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
4548137 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
4548138 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
4548139 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
4548140 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
4548141 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
4548142 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
4548143 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
4548144 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
4548145 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
4548146 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
4548147 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
4548148 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
4548149 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
4548150 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
4548151 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
4548152 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
4548153 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
4548154 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
4548155 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
4548156 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
4548157 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
4548158 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
4548159 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
4548160 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
4548161 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
4548162 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
4548163 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
4548164 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
4548165 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
4548166 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party

4548171 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
4548172 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
4548173 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
4548174 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
4548175 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported

4548177 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism

4548186 if they show an increasing indifference to the value of palestinian lives even shooting innocent civilians deliberately and criminally it is to be expected not that it is excusable but it is understandable

4548188 the fact that so many of the hedgies are doing the same thing and indeed conceivably not infrequently are on either side of a trade combined with the heavy use of leverage and their hyperactive trading add up to a potentially explosive investment mix

4548190 that last paragraph by ma2 275 was snotty and uncalled for in my opinion

4548215 what have the palestinians or the gulf states given in reperations
4548216 by way of introduction the obvious cannot be overstressed here namely that israel is the occupier and therefore the aggressor while the palestinians are the occupied and therefore the victims paradoxically this fact is hardly ever even taken into consideration by western politicians thus ignoring the fundamental element of the conflict needless to say attempting to solve this conflict without differentiating between the aggressor israel and the victimized the palestinians will never lead to permanent peace

4548221 we should prepare to go over to the offensive our aim is to smash lebanon trans jordan and syria the weak point is lebanon for the moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine we shall establish a christian state there and then we will smash the arab legion eliminate trans jordan syria will fall to us we then bomb and move on and take port said alexandria and sinai
4548222 if i were an arab leader i would never sign an agreement with israel it is normal we have taken their country it is true god promised it to us but how could that interest them our god is not theirs there has been anti semitism the nazis hitler auschwitz but was that their fault they see but one thing we have come and we have stolen their country why would they accept that
4548223 the most grievous expression of the situation in the occupied territories under olmert and barak is the daily killing
4548224 in the end the so called palestinians are all doomed
4548225 israel has offered a peace deal to the palestinians which would annex 7 3 of the west bank and keep the largest settlements israeli reports say
4548226 meanwhile more folk die while desperately trying to break the fairs fair
4548227 the character of the provisional palestinian state will be determined through negotiations between the palestinian authority and israel the provisional state will have provisional borders and certain aspects of sovereignty be fully demilitarized with no military forces but only with police and internal security forces of limited scope and armaments be without the authority to undertake defense alliances or military cooperation and israeli control over the entry and exit of all persons and cargo as well as of its air space and electromagnetic spectrum
4548228 strange in 1945 there was no israel either so whats your point that israel does not exist
4548229 the brits you spoke to are mistaken the problems in the middle east were started by the british and the french after world war one
4548230 as to where this policy of the british and later the americans originated we neednt look further than a series of meetings held in britain starting in 1905 headed by prime minister sir henry campbell bannerman from this a high committee was formed it specialized in matters of colonialism consisting of members from the participating states of leading historians social economic and agricultural analysts scholars geologists and experts in oil and gas the members of this committee met in london in 1907 the final decisions made by the conference were threefold 1 separating the muslim lands in the east from those in the west making their unity more difficult 2 planting a new enemy for the muslims on their lands in the first qiblah and the third of the holiest mosques this would draw their attention to a new enemy focusing all their energies on defeating him and in turn weakening their capability of resisting western aggression causing them to forget what occurred during the days of the crusades 3 establishing an advanced base for the disbelieving colonialists at the head of them britain to protect their interests implement their plans and schemes and ensuring the outflow of natural resources from the region as well as the import of their goods and products into the markets of the region the goal of the colonialist powers then and now is to keep arab peoples backwards by not enabling them to elect popular leaders and to control the vast mineral wealth that the arabs were fortune enough to possess
4548231 the sykes picot agreement concluded in 1916 divided the middle east into areas of influence for france great britain and others giving the french control over modern syria and lebanon

4548235 this policy to shoot first if there is the slightest doubt has rendered it almost impossible for us to do our jobs in gaza along with the rest of the international media
4548236 government spokesman mark regev said israel understood the role of an independent free press in a free society
4548237 these are situations that are faced internationally and we have got to find a better way to try to make sure journalists are not caught up in crossfire
4548238 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable
4548239 sometime before the creation of israel england pulled back its support of a jewish settlement
4548240 the balfour declaration illustrates the contradictions in a single paragraph
4548241 his majestys government view with favour the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non jewish communities in palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country
4548242 when the question of the british mandate over palestine was discussed in parliament it became clear that opinion in the house of lords was strongly opposed to the balfour policy as illustrated by the words of lord sydenham in reply to lord balfour
4548243 the harm done by dumping down an alien population upon an arab country arab all around in the hinterland may never be remedied what we have done is by concessions not to the jewish people but to a zionist extreme section to start a running sore in the east and no one can tell how far that sore will extend

4548264 a sobering documentation of the growing threat of nutrient pollution in coastal waters around the world
4548265 the evidence suggests that if the spigot of nutrients can be turned off coastal systems can recover
4548266 doing it can be accomplished by using fertilizers more efficiently preventing human and animal sewage from entering rivers and replanting vegetation along riverbanks to absorb excess nutrients
4548267 however nutrient inputs are again rising there as agriculture expands and a return to hypoxic conditions may be imminent
4548268 i cant help them with their problem they cant see me i can be like 68 years old and im still trouble because theyre thinking about something in vietnam or theyre thinking about jane fonda or they think i slept with their daughter they think i burned my draft card its like a big rorschach of things that i did or did not do
4548269 i think that denver officials would be well advised not to believe everything that the fbi warns them about
4548270 thats how things can get out of hand due to fabricated exaggerated projections about violence or protest
4548271 what you saw in 2000 was the claim that 75 000 anarchists were descending the secret funding of permanent police equipment the denial of permits for protesters you saw the same thing in 2004 you will see the same thing in 2008
4548272 i planned for multiple scenarios not knowing which one would play out
4548273 but certainly after the murder of kennedy coming on the murder of king to me it was in the air that we were going to be busted and face serious harm unless we surrendered and left the city and simply went along with the plan just go along with our own disappearance
4548274 in evaluating this case you should bear in mind that your prime objectives should be to neutralize him in the new left movement
4548275 thousands of hairy yippies were going to have sex in public while drinking from the lsd laden waters of lake michigan they actually believed that and this sex in the parks on acid would occur at roughly the same moment that black revolutionaries would storm the convention with guns
4548276 named strangely enough in memory of chicago police killed by an anarchists bomb during a violent confrontation between police and protesters in 1886
4548277 it takes two for a riot to occur and if it wasnt for the fbi advisers chicago 68 would not have happened repeat would not have happened
4548278 i do think they are playing around unnecessarily with the rights of protesters to protest
4548279 i dont know how the negotiations will come out but you know naming something a protest zone but then not allowing it to be heard or seen its a mockery of the first amendment most importantly its not necessary
4548280 it does seem to me theres a legitimate right to protest at stake
4548281 i dont think the protests will be very large if obama is the nominee i dont see the point in interfering with them its particularly crazy because most of the delegates at the democratic convention have been in many demonstrations themselves
4548282 the message was that the people coming to protest deserve this kind of repression if they get out of hand theyre just trying to scare the public into justifying more tax dollars for a false sense of security more gadgets for the police department
4548283 if they had given us permits i doubt there would have been much confrontation at all
4548284 what caused the rioting in the streets was the lack of permits and the lack of a place to stay too much order creates disorder is the way ive always put it
4548285 you dont have the draft you have one fifteenth of the american casualties now that you had at this point during vietnam the establishment is doing everything it can to keep this war from impacting the american people and yet people have seen through it
4548286 which i think means the ghosts of 68 are still with us people know a quagmire when they see one
4548287 i studied the film and i was always amazed on a lot of plays it was really me
4548288 it wasnt the offensive line not getting a block or anything like that or anything they were doing really it was really me kind of hurting myself
4548289 i was able to take a lot from those tapes
4548290 just being more patient and learning to play up the gut more
4548291 well its no pressure for me to be honest because im harder on myself than anybody thats really how i do things
4548292 i set my goals high and the expectations high for myself and i work hard at accomplishing those goals
4548293 me and jay decided im going to stay with him
4548294 what im going to do is take over his basement

4548306 while i respect governor carters sensitivity to the needs of blacks and women i do not feel that the country is ready to accept a woman in the second highest office in the land
4548307 however when that time does come i plan to be ready
4548308 i appreciate very much your vote of confidence in me and your belief that i am qualified to be the vice presidential nominee of the democratic party
4548309 i chose not to have my name placed in nomination for the position because i believe that if and when my name or the name of any other black american is placed in nomination it should be done with a serious intent such was not the case for my name being placed in nomination in new york city
4548310 the black world her world the fifth ward of houston
4548311 she did listen but she wanted you to take her advice particularly
4548312 she would listen to some of the things that i said but she really liked to have the last word
4548313 she was strong in her convictions and she even softened his heart in a sense too

4548316 there is something special about tonight what is different what is special i barbara jordan am a keynote speaker
4548317 many fear the future many are distrustful of their leaders and believe that their voices are never heard many seek only to satisfy their private wants to satisfy their private interests
4548318 but this is the great danger america faces that we will cease to be one nation and become instead a collection of interest groups each seeking to satisfy private wants if that happens who then will speak for america who then will speak for the common good this is the question which must be answered in 1976 are we to be one people bound together by common spirit sharing in a common endeavor or will we become a divided nation
4548319 there is not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
4548320 perhaps the times were right for a black woman to step forth and represent the entire nation because thats what she did
4548321 we made progress up to the 70s but so much more progress needs to be made to get america ready
4548322 because the very question that is being raised there would be no reason for the question if we were ready nobody would ask are we ready we would just move along

4548671 we welcome you to the first but not the last business development conference
4548672 the aim of the one day business development conference was to provide contract registration training to local iraqi contractors and teach them how to access business opportunities that are offered by jcci rcc basrah and grs also provided in the presentation were how to prepare responses to solicitations and how the proposals are evaluated
4548673 there is a clear difference in the quality of proposals from contractors that receive this type of training versus contractors that have not had training the contractors and the proposals also become competitive
4548674 i consider todays conference one of the most important events there were lots of mistakes made in our previous proposals that we didnt know about now we are able to avoid those mistakes and compete to win more projects to help build the future of our country
4548675 we got very useful and valuable guidance that will help us make successful proposals
4548676 so they give us all the documentation we need for a successful evaluation
4548677 in addition jcci rcc basrah will have 40 to 70 smaller contracts in the next three weeks that will permit new companies excellent opportunities to gain experience

4548712 now he who searches the heart also knows what the mind of the spirit is because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of god
4548713 therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those come to god through him since he always lives to make intercession for them
4548714 but he being full of the holy spirit gazed into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god and said look i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god
4548715 any whois record data for review while the sites are still active
4548716 given the listed issues we are recommending that xin net be issued a breach notice and that until these issues are resolved they be prevented from registering new domains the failure to comply with requirements to have accurate records the blatant and continued posting of illicit traffic sites and possible blocking of access to whois records point to a complete failure at xin net to accept its responsibility as a registrar we believe that this situation poses an immediate health risk to internet consumers and since xin net will not take proactive steps to prevent repeat offenders from registering fake pharmacy sites stopping all new registrations is the only way to break this cycle of illicit site registration and faux compliance

4548745 a specialist in the history composition and psychology of the energy market believes that speculators were without question behind the run up of prices to 147 per barrel in july and that government threats to expose and punish their behavior spooked them out of their positions in a hurry he says his data on open interest of noncommercial positions in crude trading as well as conversations with professional traders at big oil companies clearly show that speculators and not rising demand from asia pushed the market to extremes
4548746 what about all that talk of how supply is running out well its funny the spike to 147 seems to have really got people thinking about scarcity and theyve started making plans that could be very long lasting its sort of like the day a person realizes its time to stop smoking a light bulb moment of alertness to a long simmering crisis oil bears now think the 147 level was a slap in the face that made major corporate users consider changing their behavior in persistent and fundamental ways
4548747 i do think that to be changing in the middle of the stream can be very inconvenient not only for the institutions but for the students
4548748 our alternative was to have a knee jerk reaction to all of this
4548749 and so rather than continue and possibly risk flip flopping lets maintain the status quo get our study done and come out with a well reasoned policy
4548750 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place

4548759 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4548760 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4548761 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4548762 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4548763 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4548764 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4548765 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4548766 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4548767 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like

4548775 that you have not read the gospel of our lord jesus christ completely in another place we read if your eye causes you sin tear it out and throw it away mt 5 29 here he wanted to teach us that every man however dear and close he is to us and even if he is precious to us as the apple of our eye must be repulsed pulled out expelled if he seeks to turn us aside from the faith and love of our god that is why it is just that christians invade the land you inhabit for you blaspheme the name of christ and alienate everyone you can from his worship but if you were to recognize confess and adore the creator and redeemer christians would love you as themselves

4548813 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4548814 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4548912 i was very enthusiastic about what i heard i began to read the bible every day and i continued with religion lessons i did it in secret of course i used to travel to the ramallah hills to places like the al tira neighborhood and to sit there quietly with the amazing landscape and read the bible
4548913 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
4548914 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one

4548961 all created financial literacy programs to improve their citizens fiscal health
4548962 more than 40 percent of american families spend more than they earn
4548963 the growing negative economic effects of financial illiteracy has spurred the nonprofit and private sector to dramatically increase their investment in financial education and counseling

4548966 the toll being inflicted on web advertising by the slowing economy
4548967 if the stock lingers between 500 or worse yet drifts lower you will see a brain drain of epic proportions
4548968 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4548969 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4548970 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4548971 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4548972 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4548973 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4548974 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4548975 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4548976 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4548977 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4548978 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4548979 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4548980 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4548981 your team was so close we know they the multiple award nominee had written their film in advance but you know

4548984 banks should have to get their customers affirmative consent before signing them up for their most expensive loans
4548985 ive been working on reducing sky high overdraft fees for several years now
4548986 overdraft loans can be useful financial tools but many consumers are being enrolled in costly overdraft protection programs without their consent
4548987 in most cases banking customers can avoid overdrafting their accounts and paying any associated fee by knowing their balances
4548988 they can call pnc and we will automatically exclude them from the convenience of overdraft access for all atm transactions and purchases
4548989 het is gebaseerd op het feit dat de acteur russisch bloed heeft
4548990 we had a fantastic screening in new york at the village east which was incredible
4548991 it had a line going around the block and we had to turn away over a hundred people we did another one in the arclight in los angeles with kevin smith moderating which was very fun last year in london we did a spaced marathon screening at the national film theatre which was the first time wed seen all of the episodes on the big screen and it was amazing watching it at the arclight on a huge screen with stereo sound so its great to be sitting there seven years later eight years later with a packed house watching something that was originally intended for the small screen
4548992 its the first thing that we did and for me and im certainly sure for jess as well it has such significance in terms of our lives
4548993 it was such a passion project i look back on how it got made and how we did it and we were just feeling our way a lot of the time the whole thing was incredibly serendipitous in that it actually got done when we were writing the first series we would just hang around at each others houses writing a tv show get some food maybe and then next thing we knew we walked onto the set and we were in this apartment building that wed written about vaguely that the production team had put together and it was happening seeing edgars storyboards as well was like wow this is going to happen and that feeling has never gone away we owe it a lot
4548994 i just thought yeah its gonna be on it will be on the notion of a greenlight was like i didnt know what the term meant i assumed we had it
4548995 it was a low budget show so the fact that we were slightly under the radar in the terms of cost meant that we kind of had carte blanche within the budget and the schedule to do whatever we wanted
4548996 its one of those experiences that you look back and realize how fortunate you were that we were that age and had this show where we could kind of do anything within reason reason being time and money but still really did not have any scrutiny in terms of the content
4548997 i do remember one producer sort of questioning my usage of fifties style horned rimmed glasses without the glass in them
4548998 he was like i just dont understand and i told them trust me it will be fine
4548999 no one said a thing about having an episode where everyone is clearly off their head on ecstasy
4549000 a lot of the time we were talking about things that were very specific that age group and a lot of times things just went over their heads and they didnt realize in the clubbing episode of spaced it was very much a love letter to the fact that you could go out take drugs and come back and not die in every tv show there had to be some moral message some punitive act
4549001 there was an innocence about it it just kind of happened
4549002 they all went out together as friends they came back as little gang and that was the night many people only have one or two nights like that ever and thats the whole point about it its not a show that then becomes about hardcore drug use
4549003 it was just like this happens the whole show was about this happens people spark up a joint in the afternoon sometimes and dont crash their car and kill some children it happens and that was important to just show things how it was
4549004 edgars such firm pals now with him but to be commenting on the episode where we do the pulp fiction thing where daisy finds the gun and its mike in the toilet with tarantino in the room talking about it was the most incredible moment of circularity perhaps in my entire life to have done that in honor of him and then to have him come in and speak in honor of it it doesnt get any better then that
4549005 meeting these people over the last couple of years you realize who the big fans are and stuff
4549006 so i thought lets get them all on this commentary track it will be fantastic and it was really fun doing it
4549007 so it was a lot of hard work by our producers like nyra parks and karen beaver and the distributors just to get a handling on it ironically one of the people who helped with a sort of crucial bit to get the music cleared up was the real nicholas angel nick angel whos a music supervisor
4549008 it was highly ironic that the real nick angel came to our rescue
4549009 i like the fact that they had to clear my elvis impersonation with the elvis estate
4549010 i am proud of the fact that they approved it
4549011 obviously the demand for it has grown with the success of the two movies as well
4549012 and has created an awareness and people have kind of decided that perhaps they want to go back and see like when you discover a band and you think i wonder what they were doing before i found them it just took a long time for all the right conditions to arise and here we are so
4549013 its much like if you were a fan of aerosmith through walk this way
4549014 our fear is that if we went back to it now we wouldnt be qualified to do it
4549015 it would have to comment on the fact that we were older but i definitely think daisy is still living in that flat
4549016 i think tim might have moved out but shes living there
4549017 hes got a book comic hes doing a panel later on lets go see him we can ask him what happened
4549018 i keep eating my words theres a line in spaced when i say sure as eggs is eggs sure as day follows night sure as every odd numbered star trek movie is shit
4549019 i can just say that that rule has been thoroughly reset man
4549020 the rule doesnt exist anymore ive had a bit of a fanboys kind of dream really in being able to be in shows and films jess and i were both in doctor who which we loved as kids then to do star trek
4549021 there was a poll and i was like number two
4549022 and i really dont want to ruin that show it was bad enough when i saw mission impossible 3 i was enjoying it so much and suddenly theres my big potato face
4549023 i havent liked the way you look since you started wearing make up
4549024 dont ever send me another picture of you looking like that
4549025 i bet youd get more dates if youd stop wearing girl clothes guys dont like that
4549026 this is the dustin i knew you look so much better
4549027 no i dont think dustin would do that to you hes your best friend
4549028 yeah i think cooper likes your boyfriend and hes trying to move in on him
4549029 if you want the fruit you gotta out out on the branch
4549030 20 things that you need to believe to be a republican
4549031 executive privilege for every republican ever born who will be born or who might be born in perpetuity
4549032 the bush administration officially admitted the implementation of the plan on march 1 2002 key congressional leaders say they didnt know this government in waiting had been established
4549033 on july 18 2007 rep peter defazio d ore a member of the u s house committee on homeland security was denied access to the classified version of the continuity of government plan though members can access classified information this is the first time documents have been denied
4549034 in a nutshell proponents of cog envision a terrorist attack that would precipitate the suspension of the u s constitution specifically cog would authorize congress to appoint its own members including those in state legislatures without a vote of the people cog even envisions the enactment of such authority for reasons of incapacitation whatever that is even if no emergency exists
4549035 translated into laymans terms when the president determines a national emergency has occurred the president can declare to the office of the presidency powers usually assumed by dictators to direct any and all government and business activities until the emergency is declared over
4549036 there have been many top tier dota teams that i have admired throughout the years but none like this one at first i fell in love with their unique playstyle and then learned that they were such amazing people fnatic has such always had an extraordinary name in e sports so i knew this was a team that would fit them im happy to be given the opportunity to help them
4549037 i dont think theres any correlation between being a sports owner and supporting john mccain i think theres a correlation between being a businessman and supporting john mccain
4549038 although i have business issues and i have differences with sen obama on some tax issues thats overridden by my commitment to what i believe he will contribute to the overall good of the country
4549039 some nba owners are republicans some nba owners are democrats
4549040 but one thing they have in common is theyre all businessmen
4549041 i was hitchhiking through battle creek michigan and we were passing through about the time the local high school was getting out and i was looking at the girls
4549042 experienced women are the the best in every way age is not a factor
4549043 older women just ooze sex and boy do they know what theyre doing
4549044 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4549045 i had a cold for a couple days and i didnt tell anyone i dont know how it got out
4549046 but its no big deal i had to go out there swim a good pace placed a good time and its just a matter of getting ready for the final
4549047 every time i touch the wall its a mystery until i look up
4549048 i think shes an amazing woman and an amazing competitor
4549049 i really admire her im not going to be swimming when im 40 no way
4549050 it felt really easy ive been working on my starts
4549051 my finish was horrible but hopefully by sunday i wont think about anything ill just do it
4549052 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4549053 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4549054 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4549055 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4549056 it takes both sunshine and rain to make a rainbow
4549057 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4549058 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4549059 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4549060 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4549061 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4549062 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4549063 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4549064 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4549065 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4549066 for years now we have encouraged schools that its the taking part that counts and not the winning what these cyclists are doing goes against the grain of our britishness we should be the down trodden likeable losers we will be challanging the lottery funding and ensuring that their funds are channelled more appropriately into worth while causes like arts for gay women
4549067 die is bedoeld voor mensen die hem een warm hart toedroegen
4549068 tenemos un nuevo guitarrista que tocar con nosotros por primera vez en el d a de ma ana ser la primera vez que tocaremos juntos en el escenario su nombre es wes borland
4549069 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4549070 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4549071 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations
4549072 not only put to rest the plans for the funeral but more importantly are the early innings a gradual steady improvement
4549073 the same thing is happening on a smaller scale at a north carolina furniture manufacturing plant because of soaring transportation costs factory owner casey
4549074 basically im looking for a different challenge in my life
4549075 im 48 years of age this might be the last chance im going to get for a challenge if i want to take it
4549076 sirius would be one of them obviously im not stupid im not going to leave fan unless i have something relatively secure
4549077 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4549078 the latest rasmussen reports national telephone survey found that 55 believe media bias is more of a problem than big campaign contributions
4549079 an investigation by the washington post into what happened that day suggests that both sides have withheld information from the public record and provided an incomplete and sometimes inaccurate picture of what took place but although kerrys accusers have succeeding in raising doubts about his war record they have failed to come up with sufficient evidence to prove him a liar the posts research shows that both accounts contain significant flaws and factual errors
4549080 but although kerrys accusers have succeeded in raising doubts about his war record they have failed to come up with sufficient evidence to prove him a liar
4549081 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4549082 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4549083 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4549084 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take
4549085 bajo el sistema federativo los funcionarios p blicos no pueden disponer de las rentas sin responsabilidad no pueden gobernar a impulsos de una voluntad caprichosa sino con sujeci n a las leyes no pueden improvisar fortunas ni entregarse al ocio y a la disipaci n sino consagrarse asiduamente al trabajo disponi ndose a vivir en la honrada median a que proporciona la retribuci n que la ley se ala
4549086 miller says the marlins had a deal for manny ramirez worked out but the commissioners office killed it because the marlins wouldve been getting draft picks rather than a second player
4549087 wtf how did you just take 18k damage and get one shot
4549088 wowiarmory allows you to view the world of warcraft armory di
4549089 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4549090 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4549091 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4549092 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4549093 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4549094 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4549095 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4549096 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4549097 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4549098 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4549099 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4549100 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4549101 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4549102 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4549103 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4549104 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4549105 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4549106 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4549107 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4549108 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4549109 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4549110 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4549111 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4549112 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4549113 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4549114 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4549115 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4549116 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4549117 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4549118 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4549119 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4549120 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4549121 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4549122 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4549123 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4549124 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4549125 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4549126 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4549127 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4549128 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4549129 who are open to doing something on the production side
4549130 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4549131 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4549132 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4549133 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4549134 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4549135 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4549136 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4549137 i think that liberal leader stephane dion will have to make up his mind and i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4549138 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4549139 we have important legislation that is stalled in the senate by the liberal party we have other legislation that is obstructed in the house of commons principally by dion we have a committee system that is increasingly in chaos and we have mr dion regularly threatening to force an election so i think you have to make up your mind pretty soon
4549140 the conservatives antics are just dragging this committee into the gutter
4549141 its mr harper and his house leader and his whip who have been orchestrating the dysfunctionality of this particular parliament
4549142 a major part of whatever is dysfunctional is coming from the government side he is choosing to cover over that which is another reason why people dont trust mr harper
4549143 what we are saying to stephane dion is make up your mind for once and stick to it either force that election or co operate and allow us to govern stop the delaying and obstruction tactics
4549144 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4549145 either let the current parliament work and let us get on with our mandate or the voters themselves will decide
4549146 we have important legislation that is stalled in the senate by the liberal party we have other legislation that is obstructed in the house of commons principally by liberal leader stephane dion
4549147 i cant wait to see how he explains why sweden can have a comparable standard of living and unemployment rate to us with a 150 tonne carbon tax and insist that a 40 tonne carbon tax will destroy canada
4549148 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4549149 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4549150 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4549151 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4549152 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4549153 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4549154 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4549155 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4549156 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4549162 well i might as well just see whats on tv first
4549163 oh there is a better way to do this that doesnt require our training nor our consultants
4549164 but our study may be the first to report a similar association in people without diabetes
4549165 interestingly the risk magnitude from retinopathy is similar to the risk from diabetes alone and if a person has both diabetes and retinopathy the risk is double compared to those with neither
4549166 there is increasing recognition that coronary microvascular dysfunction also plays an important role in chd particularly in women and in persons with diabetes
4549167 these findings suggest that the presence of retinopathy regardless of a persons diabetes status may indicate underlying subclinical vascular disease
4549168 we speculate that retinopathy may mirror similar changes in small vessels of other organs of the body including the heart if this is proven the small vessel condition in the retina may be used as a window to the small vessel condition of the body and assessment of retinal condition using retinal imaging may help to identify those at high risk of cardiovascular disease
4549169 may benefit from a thorough cv risk assessment lifestyle changes better management of risk factors and closer monitoring for chd events
4549170 it will be nice to be out there and play a little bit and see if we can make improvements from last week
4549171 we remain hopeful that well see a tentative agreement this weekend
4549172 we welcome all investors and are focused on enhancing value for all shareholders
4549173 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
4549174 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4549175 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
4549176 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
4549177 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4549178 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4549179 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4549180 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4549181 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4549182 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4549183 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4549184 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4549185 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4549186 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4549187 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4549188 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4549189 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4549190 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4549191 although creation is good because of the imprint it bears of its creator and its created order has been vindicated by christs resurrection its perfection will be accomplished only in christ in the fullness of time
4549192 since dominion is a divine blessing god expects its recipients to exercise it in accordance with creations vindicated order and appoint end in christ according to oliver odonovan the death resurrection and ascension of jesus christ vindicates creation and its order the word creation implies a given order otherwise the universe would consist of undifferentiated matter and energy since gods created order includes all creatures and the natural processes upon which they depend creations vindication provides an objective and expansive focal point for moral deliberation this does not mean that we may simply look to nature and discover given norms or ethical principles this would reduce creation to nature diminishing the significance of christs resurrection rather a vindicated creation discloses a natural ethic that can only be perceived in its ordering in and to christ as the head of creation and first born from the dead it is what christs resurrection reveals that enables us to see a created order instead of a more narrowly construed natural order
4549193 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game

4549200 they dont know what they are getting into they have pushed him into a corner maybe before he might have thought about stepping down but not now
4549201 i think he feels that his replacement at this stage would compromise pakistan
4549202 negotiations are going on between the coalition and the army for a safe exit to be given to musharraf
4549203 i think the americans and the army are demanding he be given safe passage for the army impeachment would mean a huge distraction from the war on terror and may even be seen as the army being impeached
4549204 weve said he can have what he wants his house his security
4549205 the time has come for the military leadership to go and have a quiet word with mr musharraf

4549209 there is no doubt to me that the hispanic undocumented population is two to three times higher than what is shown
4549210 for instance when i speak over in lexington the police there say they believe the hispanic population is between 20 000 and 30 000 and some officials say it could be as much as 50 000
4549211 we have been talking here lately to leaders of the hispanic community and they have expressed to us that they believe the number to be over 5 000
4549212 even though some of your readers dont like the growing hispanic population they are going to be taking care of our white butts down the road

4549222 unfair treatment by supervisors squalid restrooms poor working conditions and frequent and arbitrary intimidation by management
4549223 we have not reported suspended fired or reprimanded anyone for support or lack of support for a union
4549224 if they are worried about their reputation they should do the right thing and improve working conditions and allow workers the right to unionize
4549225 are one of the biggest problems facing us and other companies
4549226 there are definitely tensions that we didnt have three months ago the union is driving a wedge through the work force

4549238 none of us including myself were able to stay in the interview room with him long enough to get through a thorough questioning let alone sit in a cubicle next to him
4549239 what he can do as you know there is the question of the governor here
4549240 there is the question to maybe have a new governor theyre a sovereign state theyre going to have to decide and its a decision the president will have to take in the near future is it the right person at the right place at the right time president karzai will have to answer these questions as soon as possible
4549241 i just want you to know the 800 record is going to go

4549259 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4549260 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun

4549268 in a criminal investigation only a judge or a prosecutor can issue a subpoena
4549269 the issue is whether hes going to be charged with a crime or any other crime that may have occurred
4549270 if anything in this country we have a right to criticize public officials
4549271 having a da of all people to investigate a criminal libel charge is nothing short of absolutely unacceptable for him of all people to investigate criminal libel seems to be an abuse of his power and seems to be intended to quiet his critics
4549272 everyone around us got one but we havent heard a word
4549273 were both old and crippled and we receive about 1 606 a month thats for both of us so were having a hard time

4549278 with both my wife and i having demanding corporate jobs it was tough finding a balance for family weve found this to be a very good solution for us
4549279 from the candidates perspective it allows parents time with their kids but still allows them to utilize their skills
4549280 from the clients perspective as resources get tighter and companies look to stretch their dollars they get everything they are looking for without having to pay benefits
4549281 in this economy employers are wanting skilled workers but dont want to have to pay full blown salary with the extra costs of benefits
4549282 were a new bank only 2 years old so as we grow itll likely call for a full time position but our needs dont warrant that today
4549283 being a small business thats considerable savings in not having to pay benefits for an employee that we need so few hours a week
4549284 the 10 til 2 niche is still unique in the staffing industry but will likely be a growth area in our industry in the coming years

4549311 so long as markets are relatively calm and nothing comesout of the woodwork in terms of credit market concerns thestory for the dollar remains a robust one
4549312 there are two important factors supporting the dollar atthe moment the more widespread weakness in internationaleconomies and the fact that the extent of the financial shocksseem to be less severe this time than it was earlier in theyear

4549331 support you in a decision not to increase the rate structure or to reduce them by a small amount
4549332 you just need to understand the consequences of a zero rate increase

4549366 the plans for abu dhabi are truly remarkable the transport infrastructure is also already sound and the states pockets are bottomless
4549367 abu dhabi plans to be a premier global tourism destination within the next three years the emirate will see major investment in airport infrastructure which will increase airport capacity from seven million to 20 million passengers a year by 2011
4549368 from an investors point of view abu dhabi has several serious advantages with a 200 billion investment programme scheduled for the next 10 years its little wonder that there is such excitement around this market
4549369 the only way to combat this inflationary problems is to lose the peg and allow the aed to float freely

4549404 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4549405 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4549406 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
4549407 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems

4549414 the take home message here is its a big deal

4549417 there are unique needs in the united states the types of vehicles that resonate with consumers will be the ones that offer reasonable utility and pretty good fuel economy not the super small ones with high fuel economy

4549427 young people have been a vital part of the church of the nazarene since our earliest days the good news is that they still are and will be for years to come
4549428 lessons for adults were written by nazarene educator and author dr frank moore and include everything necessary to make the history message and mission of the church of the nazarene come alive for adults as they prepare for the centennial celebration
4549429 our centennial celebration provides the most significant opportunity we will ever have to reinforce our commitment to our core values
4549430 this is vital to our future lets celebrate our identity as it is expressed in these values they are a global expression of our most basic reasons for our existence as a church
4549431 basically last week there were sporadic cross border firefights which frankly is common
4549432 the russians began aerial attacks on targets all across georgia and on many targets nowhere near the conflict zone civilian targets including food warehouses were hit cell phone towers especially were targeted hence cell phone coverage went down over large portions of the country
4549433 the russians eventually began to emerge from the borders of the conflict zone
4549434 and have taken at least two georgian sites senaki a military base by the abkhaz border and gori at least the main highway my old training site
4549435 georgia recognized the impossibility of the situation and began to give the we give up please stop shooting signals
4549436 the russians have seemingly disregarded all attempts at georgian ceasefire that takes us pretty much up to today august 11 russia has occupied georgian territory outside of the conflict zones and seems likely to take more territory
4549437 they have no reinforcements from the west coming and have to entirely depend on diplomatic pressures from the west we have some hope still but it will entirely depend on how the russians respond to international pressures georgias economic situation is pretty bad now this war reverses decades of progress with tourism and foreign direct investment money is fleeing georgia and im not sure if russian bombs or the capital flight will do more damage well have to see what happens i remain hopeful but im in a nearby country brenden

4549455 it has been a rewarding job but also a difficult job you want to do lots of things and there are always lots of limits the difficult thing is how to balance all those aspects of a job that by nature is highly complex
4549456 we are now in the main lobby the idea that everybody comes to this passageway and you right away are encountering this very dramatic circulation point
4549457 you know color is a way of enlarging the limit of a budget because what i mean by that is you still have to paint these walls but it doesnt have to be white for instance these are mechanical shafts all of these green areas have functions that are particular objective
4549458 this is the longest north elevation on the entire campus and the purpose of that was that they get this even light
4549459 all the studios face north if you place them on the east you have dead light in the afternoon on the west you have the opposite
4549460 the question you raise is an interesting one because its for them to take over
4549461 its for the artist to come up with the next stage of the architecture if i were an artist and i come in here and i see that then i would do something with that wall the architecture is there for you to participate in or to ignore if you want to thats sort of what i always hoped to achieve with this building

4549476 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4549477 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4549478 it was a gathering of minds and hearts not of labels
4549479 folks gathered at the newly acquired parcel of land in the woods to worship god with spirited music and hear the word of god preached by anointed men and women
4549480 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier

4549494 they are in progress he is meeting with them one by one
4549495 you have tsvangirais backers who are playing hardball and insisting on the virtual disappearance of robert mugabe and youve got robert mugabes backers insisting he remains maintains some kind of executive powers
4549496 this is a hot issue which calls for zimbabweans themselves to be more committed but discussions are going very well and we expect good results from the sadc meeting
4549497 we need to establish mass manufacturing incentives so we can credibly compete
4549498 we are importing more than 50 of our lithium at outrageously high prices from hostile foreign sources it is killing our trade balance amp seriously impacting our national security

4549502 five years ago president bush challenged americas innovators to develop new hydrogen technologies to help reduce our nations dependence on oil and today we have a fleet of hydrogen vehicles making their way across the country
4549503 these hydrogen vehicles are the non polluting cars of tomorrow and they are being demonstrated today on our nations roads
4549504 hydrogen is part of a balanced and diverse energy portfolio that will help address our future energy environmental and economic security needs
4549505 this tour provides americans an opportunity to see what the future could hold for hydrogen powered vehicles as we work to help make these vehicles cost competitive and available for all
4549506 the toll being inflicted on web advertising by the slowing economy

4549516 lamentable estado de conservaci n en el que se encuentra el palacio de nava un emblem tico edificio de indudable valor patrimonial que se encuentra cerrado desde hace 30 a os sin que el grupo de gobierno de cc haya hecho nada por reformarlo ni restaurarlo
4549517 en forma de humedades exteriores desperfecto de sus cubiertas que amenazan en muchos casos con su derrumbe o deficientes instalaciones el ctricas que no garantizan ni su seguridad ni su conservaci n
4549518 se deteriora a un ritmo muy superior al normal y desde luego no nos gustar a encontrarnos con que el patrimonio de la laguna pierde nuevamente uno de sus inmuebles m s emblem ticos tal y como sucediera con la casa salazar sede del obispado
4549519 nos resulta parad jico que el grupo de gobierno de la se ora oramas desee aplicarle la ordenanza t cnica de edificios al com n de los mortales y que luego sea incapaz de aplic rsela a los edificios que son de su estricta competencia tambi n resulta incre ble que desee privar de sus propiedades en el caso de que no las conserven a los titulares de casas en el casco hist rico y que sea incapaz de aplicarse el mismo rigor con respecto a los edificios que son de propiedad municipal
4549520 no s lo cuenta con un valor patrimonial de primer orden sino que adem s tiene una historia important sima para la laguna y para todo el archipi lago pues fue morada de una de las familias m s poderosas de las islas durante cerca de 400 a os adem s de contar con una de las fachadas m s imponentes de tenerife fue sede durante la ilustraci n de la tertulia de nava siendo frecuente la presencia de ilustrados como viera y clavijo y los hermanos iriarte
4549521 i saw the trailer in the interval of singh is kinng it caught me completely by surprise amitabh is looking so smashing in his long white hair and preity looks gorgeous in a sari i have never seen her like this before it looks like an interesting film i am waiting for it to release
4549522 one person who appears to have benefitted from the fight between shah rukh and salman farah khans husband shirish kundar he has become a regular visitor to galaxy apartments hes been visiting a lot these days and stays there till late night their problems are now in the past while shirish is waiting for his acting career to take off his priority is directing films he doesnt want to be anybodys friend but just focus on his work
4549523 yes we are meeting often we are working on a film together but i cant talk about it however i would like to clarify that its not true that salman and i ever had any problems while working with each other
4549524 the film is not joker its salmans idea and he wants shirish to direct it the talks began when they bumped into each other at an event and connected the film will be a james bond like stylish action thriller with hollywood technicians its being made on a very huge scale and salman might even produce it

4549531 cut wasteful spending free us from mideast oil crack down on illegal immigration and always protect the bay
4549532 our goal is to highlight what it is about frank that has made him such a well respected and effective public servant on the eastern shore
4549533 frank has been elected twice as a democrat in a strongly republican county because his neighbors know hes an independent leader who shares their values and will fight to protect their families this is a chance for frank to introduce himself to the voters and tell them what issues he cares most about
4549534 unlike andy harris frank kratovil wont need to reinvent himself each time he runs a new tv ad
4549535 against a package that will make maryland a national leader on alternative energy and energy efficiency
4549536 an extreme makeover showing he will do or say anything to get elected
4549537 either kratovil has a short term memory or he is intentionally misleading the voters in the 1st district
4549538 being an ally of gov martin omalley d does not mean you are independent
4549539 it means kratovil wants to go to washington to be on martin omalleys side not ours
4549540 knowing my father he will be running circles around the rest of us in a matter of weeks
4549541 most workers are still sheltered from the reality of health care costs

4549544 that makes me sound like a twit sometimes people in love have to bear with their companions doing lip to lip kisses with other actors on screen it depends on how its done i thought the kareena shahid kiss in jab we met was very aesthetic and correct
4549545 he suggested i get my tattoo darkened and made an appointment for me with his tattoo artiste hes got a beautiful tattoo of his wife on his shoulder
4549546 hes a self made man he drove himself to work without an entourage and took his bags out of the car himself
4549547 if i tried to drive myself and take care of my own stuff thered be too many people stifling me as for parking a car in mumbai thats not easy you need a driver and thats not about having starry airs
4549548 while it is disappointing not to have ricky ponting available we are confident continuing his recovery and missing this series will assure ricky is ready for the demanding cricket schedule ahead for the australian team

4549564 all theyve done today is listen to the facts obviously weve heard that there are still some concerns particularly from the players association mainly to do with the confidence in the actual implementation of the security measures which are in place
4549565 its 24 days now till the tournament starts so its coming down to crunch time
4549566 what weve always said is that we reserve our rights to make a decision at the appropriate time even if we decide that were going we still reserve our rights to change our mind at any stage
4549567 taking on board the advice weve received today but also our ongoing assessments from various other sources weve got some thinking to do in the next little while things will obviously develop in the coming couple of weeks

4549573 we will establish mutually beneficial relations with marathon which after the appropriate agreement has been signed will promote successful development of the business of both companies
4549574 we are talking about the cooperation of companies whose technical and international experience are mutually complementary
4549575 by a whole series of indicators i consider the fields of the yamalo nenets autonomous region to be the most promising among unallocated fields
4549576 these resources are the most economically attractive since they have been adequately explored and are located in a region with a developed pipeline system the internal rate of return of these fields calculated by the ministry of economic developments method reaches 15 20 for a 20 year development period
4549577 carry out joint development of a number of promising siberian gas fields
4549578 within the next seven to ten years itera plans to increase its annual production volume to 80 billion cubic meters which will require capital investments on the order of 1 5 billion
4549579 in the context of developing joint projects yukos is prepared to invest funds in effective new directions to increase production
4549580 simply not been able to recruit the necessary number of workers and it will resume work on the project within a year
4549581 in response to our postspin mandate to be a faster leaner organization driving profit expansion

4549584 we will be providing a very supportive and solid severance package
4549585 we would be looking at people whose interests and skills would align with other open positions
4549586 our performance this quarter was gratifying because it continues the trend of strong revenue growth weve seen over the last several quarters
4549587 demand for our products remains robust as we strengthen our clinical and economic value proposition for customers all of our reporting segments showed both capital sales and rental revenue growth
4549588 our north america acute care segment revenue performance was again led by over 20 percent growth of our proprietary therapy rental products
4549589 finally our north america post acute care segment saw double digit growth in both capital sales and rental revenue
4549590 demand for our products during the third quarter remained firm and we saw no indications of softening trends in quotation order and sales metrics that would require our response
4549591 like most manufacturing enterprises hill rom was subject to unexpectedly strong commodity price inflation impacting input and distribution costs during the quarter
4549592 this commitment not only moves us forward in meeting our renewable goal its also a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector
4549593 utility scale deployment of pv photovoltaic technology may well become cost competitive with other forms of renewable energy generation such as solar thermal and wind
4549594 this is a very large great leap forward in economies of scale this is the wave of the future
4549595 this development is responsible for keeping a wealthier group of people in brighton beach and bringing people back from staten island new jersey or long island

4549605 the ones who didnt buy early and dont want to pay the higher prices today say its no good to live here
4549606 in the 1950s my father would sit on the boardwalk with his friends talking russian politics and american radicalism
4549607 this brings me back to those childhood moments gives us the beach and is easy to get to
4549608 when you live in the city and hear prices of 295 000 to live on the ocean its like theyre giving it away that was a few years ago but its still less than there manhattan plus its the beach that keeps me young even in the wintertime i walk its nicer because theres less people

4549612 yields have been higher than anything so far achieved during our six years together as a joint venture so there is a bright side to it all
4549613 we are all now hoping that a two week window of dry weather to complete the task isnt too much to ask

4549644 its really frustrating the way the mainstream media just ignored him and acted like he was a fringe candidate without doing any research at all i think hes really what the country needs im definitely not a fan of the huge tentacle like arms of the federal government invading everything in our lives
4549645 look at classical antiquity mainly greek rather than roman as the apogee of great style and design and reinterpret those lessons in new modern up to date ways
4549646 creates a tension between application developers and platform owners and gives users the feeling that they dont actually own the applications theyre using
4549647 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
4549648 i think this is a riskier environment to run a business
4549649 bill gates never dreamed of controlling windows applications like this
4549650 i get the thing well mr eastwood is so well beloved and this may have ramifications at academy time
4549651 but its over i said what i had to say he believes what he believes and thats that
4549652 hes always telling us that his band hes making hes always saying you guys are going to open for me hes a funny little guy
4549653 hell tell it straight up and hell be mean if he needs to hes a good critic hes a mini simon cowell
4549654 this is just incorrect i was never his agent or manager
4549655 theyre trying to take my salary and say i was the agent i wasnt
4549656 he has made gratuitous ridiculous and outrageous statements about his former clients mr krutonog was fired more than two years ago after he refused to work on the series
4549657 its difficult when you make a new record and you wanna play all the new songs live
4549658 but with technology these days therell be someone out there with a recorder and it kinda spoils it for us
4549659 you dont wanna play too many new songs because otherwise theyll be on video sharing website youtube or something so we have to pick and choose if it was up to us wed play all the new songs because theyre so fun to play
4549660 orchestrating a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of rick ross prior life as a correctional officer
4549661 the slapdash release of morrissey live at the hollywood bowl is done by warner without any consultation to me whatsoever and is in breach of their terms as laid out by themselves in an agreement made for the film between warner and my ex manager
4549662 being warner predictably the sleeve art is appalling it is the work of cash hounds and i urge people not to buy it i am not signed to warner and no royalties from this dvd will come to me please spend your money elsewhere
4549663 we were proud at being chosen to take part we all had great dreams about what we were going to do what we were going to see and what big stars we would become but all weve seen is the inside of this military camp the only thing we dream of now is going home
4549664 in the end the pupils got enough to eat even if the diet was extremely monotonous
4549665 the test performance of the opening ceremony was worst of all the pupils had to remain in the stadium for 51 hours they were hardly fed there was nowhere to sleep some managed to sleep on the seats but they didnt get more than a couple of hours at most
4549666 but the organizers have promised them an olympic certificate thanking them for their effort they will not receive pay nevertheless i think that the majority will think that it was good to do what they did for the olympics and their country
4549667 one of their own has fallen or when theres a call to fight
4549668 the red cross is incredibly grateful to international cars for generously providing this amazing gift to all who come this summer to give the gift of life
4549669 a plentiful blood supply is a community wide responsibility and we thank international cars for their continued support for helping to ensure blood will be available when it is needed
4549670 our task is to assist the division in assuring that child support payments fully reflect the cost of raising a child in new hampshire
4549671 cooperative extension is a perfect fit for this project because we have a friendly and unbiased presence in every new hampshire county we know how to use solid research to inform policy and we are able to take advantage the extensive resources of unh to insure that solid information backs any recommendations we might make
4549672 this is evident in our team dr kalinowski is a proven researcher and exemplary educator in the child policy field and dr baughman is a proven economist who was named the universitys outstanding assistant professor for 2008
4549673 during the past 15 years as poverty has eased in central cities rates of low income children in urban and rural areas has been converging
4549674 this implies that rural areas have been less responsive to changes that have benefited low income families in central cities reaffirming the unique policy needs of children in these two distinct areas
4549675 we look at children specifically because they are the most vulnerable population and they live at higher rates of poverty and low income than the general population
4549676 these numbers are also an indication of where these children might be in 20 years as there are strong ties between childhood poverty and economic challenges in adulthood
4549677 one explanation for the persistence of low income is that many low income full time working parents are employed in low wage service occupations or in occupations sensitive to seasonal cycles
4549678 at farm rich we are leading innovators of snacks appetizers and mini meals
4549679 weve learned that moms care a lot about serving warm and nutritional meals spending time with their families and also giving back to their communities we created the farm rich block party program to encourage and reward families and friends joining forces to better their communities

4549685 china olympic team posters extreme lightning extremely charred if it does not knock you down it is not lightning
4549686 china heeft zijn beleid ten aanzien van darfur drastisch veranderd de erkenning dat daar berhaupt een mensenrechtenprobleem speelt was al een doorbraak verder stuurde peking een gezant naar khartoem en heeft peking de sudanese regering publiekelijk gekritiseerd ook staakten de chinezen verzet tegen vn resoluties die de stationering van een vn vredesmacht in darfur op het oog hadden
4549687 vanaf het moment dat de spelen publiekelijk werden gekoppeld aan chinas rol in darfur begon peking terug te krabbelen
4549688 dat moet anders beter en daar gaan we aan werken
4549689 wij zijn de amerikaanse regering niet ik weet niet wat u van ons verwacht maar op het moment dat de hele wereld aan chinas voeten ligt kunnen wij dat regime toch niet ten val brengen wij hebben ons werk gedaan en iedereen weet dat china niet gemakkelijk is weggekomen met zijn moorddadige beleid in sudan
4549690 op dit moment is er nog geen aanleiding voor grote ongerustheid
4549691 de meeste organisaties leveren minder dan de standaard 49 uur kraamzorg maar aan het minimumaantal uren van 24 voldoen de meeste aardig
4549692 in dit gebied vinden relatief meer geboortes plaats mogelijk door de vele nieuwbouwwijken die daar recent zijn gebouwd maar achter de precieze oorzaak ben ik nog niet gekomen
4549693 enerzijds komt dit door het tekort aan medewerkers het is ontzettend lastig om aan gekwalificeerd personeel te komen anderzijds groeit de lokale bevolking explosief het lukt ons nog om gemiddeld vijf uur zorg per dag te leveren in sommige gevallen moeten we keuzes maken dan geven we voorrang aan gezinnen waar het eerste kind is geboren als onervaren moeders borstvoeding geven is daar veel begeleiding bij nodig
4549694 wij kampen met een groot personeelstekort het indicatieprotocol dat in 2006 is ingevoerd zorgde ervoor dat veel personeel vertrok omdat het geen fulltimebaan meer kon krijgen
4549695 in de meeste gebieden leveren we meer alleen in de regio amsterdam zitten we erg krap
4549696 het leverde ons alleen al in de regio west veluwe elf nieuwe medewerkers op ook bieden wij verzorgenden de mogelijkheid om zich om te laten scholen tot kraamverzorgster
4549697 onze cli nten waren vroegtijdig ge nformeerd over de krapte in de zomerperiode blijkbaar hebben mensen begrip voor onze situatie
4549698 ons personeel werkt deze maanden extra hard sommigen doen zon drie tot vier kramen in de maand tegen normaal gesproken zon een of twee bovendien hebben wij de vakanties van onze medewerkers strak gepland
4549699 er moeten de komende weken nog een hoop bevallingen plaatsvinden
4549700 met echte tekorten hebben wij niet te maken wij schrijven in totdat de meisjes vol zitten
4549701 in juli en begin augustus was er sprake van een geboortegolf omdat een groot deel van onze kraamverzorgenden vakantie had was het wel even krap maar met hulp van krachten van rst en onze eigen oproepkrachten zijn we er uitgekomen
4549702 onze meiden zich lopen de benen uit hun lijf met name in de randstad utrecht en noord brabant minister klink van volksgezondheid geeft aan dat het personeelstekort een tijdelijk probleem is veroorzaakt door een geboortepiek maar dit lijkt mij ongeloofwaardig de personeelsproblemen spelen al jaren in de kraamzorg ze worden niet veroorzaakt door een stijging van het geboortecijfer maar door het gevoerde kabinetsbeleid
4549703 het salaris en de werkomstandigheden voor kraamverzorgenden moeten beter bovendien moet er landelijk beleid komen dat gericht is op het behouden en werven van mensen
4549704 een onervaren moeder kan wel d nken dat haar kind drinkt als het aan de borst ligt maar zonder een kraamverzorgende die het kind weegt weet ze dat niet zeker
4549705 we rekenden erop circa 120 vrouwen in de maanden juni juli en augustus te kunnen helpen dit aantal is minder dan verwacht
4549706 pro life kan tot nu toe al haar verzekerden voorzien van het aantal uren kraamzorg waarvoor ze zijn ge ndiceerd
4549707 what is possible what is the role of the state
4549708 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4549709 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4549710 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4549711 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4549712 a convicted sexual felon should not be able to live next door to your college student
4549713 theyre living away from home for the first time theyre staying out late i know theyre drinking we need to ensure their safety
4549714 its a real problem to find them a place to live
4549715 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4549716 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4549717 for the most part these people have done their time
4549718 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4549719 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse
4549720 customer satisfaction rule 47 nobody likes to wait in line
4549721 customer satisfaction rule 23 you shouldnt have to roll your own pennies
4549722 how come i need to be checked for cervical cancer if your office took out my cervix eight months ago
4549723 there is a beautiful irony that the nostalgic cabaret that is my bloody valentine are throwing at people in 2008 gets critical acclaim in the easily pleased uk press with mbv still playing the exact same set they did 20 years ago
4549724 the only trick frontman kevin shields has anymore in 2008 is actual volume and double extra pa to numb you and zero new songs
4549725 that google map thingie said they were coming gotta stay vigilant
4549726 op dit moment hebben we nog geen dramatische beslissende momenten gezien die de boodschap van de spelen in een andere richting laten gaan nog geen atleten die zoals de zwarte amerikaanse sporters tijdens de spelen in mexico in 1968 voor het oog van de camera protesteren tegen schending van mensenrechten de westerse media moeten het vooralsnog doen met kleine relatief onschuldige incidenten zoals het nepvuurwerk en dat playbackende meisje
4549727 doe je dat wel dan werkt dat alleen maar contraproductief omdat ook de chinese bevolking vindt dat de spelen v r alles vlekkeloos moeten verlopen hier is immers hun nationale trots in het geding
4549728 en consideraci n de sus altos m ritos sociales e industriales
4549729 ik heb bijna vier maanden op een olietanker gewerkt en nu kan ik niet eens meer naar mijn land terugvliegen
4549730 ik ben heel bezorgd over mijn vrouw en twee dochters
4549731 er wordt weer gevochten in gori en ook daarbuiten hebben georgische troepen geen controle over de weg van zestaponi naar gori
4549732 ongelofelijk wat die georgi rs allemaal hadden terwijl wij crepeerden
4549733 mijn kerk in tacaboni even buiten de stad heeft te maken met een nieuwe stroom vluchtelingen uit gori met hen organiseren wij regelmatig een mis daar bidden wij voor de vrede en voor hen die lijden onder dit conflict
4549734 ik probeer hier mensen op te pikken die hulp nodig hebben
4549735 ik heb vier kinderen in mijn auto en wij wachten hier al twee dagen
4549736 de russen hebben de weg in bezit genomen we weten niet wat we moeten doen misschien kunnen we een slaapplaats vinden
4549737 ik wil naar huis ik ben niet meer bang voor bombardementen wij hebben al zo veel meegemaakt
4549738 daaruit begreep ik dat dit een rechtszaak zou worden en dat ik de gevangenis in zou gaan daarom kreeg ik hier politiek asiel en nu leef ik met mijn familie in tbilisi
4549739 mijn organisatie wil ervoor vechten dat wij ons verenigen tegen rusland en dat wij allen achter georgi gaan staan als een bolwerk tegen de russische bezetting moskou moet alle militairen en hun zogenaamde vredestroepen uit dit gebied halen
4549740 saakasjvili had moeten weten dat zijn pogingen om zuid osseti weer terug te krijgen gedoemd waren te mislukken kijk eens met wat voor enorme russische reactie we nu te maken hebben
4549741 ik had gehoopt na tien jaar weer de familie van mijn georgische echtgenote te ontmoeten we hebben wel even feest gevierd bij de zwarte zee maar door die gevechten kunnen we niet meer naar huis

4549750 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
4549751 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
4549752 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
4549753 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
4549754 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

4549760 never seen anything like this in my career for software
4549761 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
4549762 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4549763 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4549764 llevar tiempo y esfuerzo para recuperar la capacidad de los peque os agricultores y no parece que haya ning n deseo pol tico para esto sin olvidar el hecho que nafta debe ser renegociada
4549765 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
4549766 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
4549767 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
4549768 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
4549769 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
4549770 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
4549771 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas

4549782 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4549783 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4549784 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4549785 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
4549786 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
4549787 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
4549788 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
4549789 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4549790 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4549791 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4549792 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4549793 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4549794 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4549795 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4549796 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4549797 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4549798 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4549799 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4549800 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4549801 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4549802 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4549803 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4549804 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4549805 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4549806 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4549807 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4549808 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4549809 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4549810 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4549811 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4549812 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4549813 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4549814 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4549815 a convicted sexual felon should not be able to live next door to your college student
4549816 theyre living away from home for the first time theyre staying out late i know theyre drinking we need to ensure their safety
4549817 its a real problem to find them a place to live
4549818 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4549819 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4549820 for the most part these people have done their time
4549821 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4549822 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse
4549823 sabemos que no vamos de la mejor forma ya que no tuvimos pruebas pero hay dos tandas de 80 minutos cada una antes de la clasificaci n

4549825 think of the host controller spec as a dummies guide to building a usb 3 0 compatible piece of silicon it is not the usb 3 0 specification itself
4549826 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4549828 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
4549829 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
4549830 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
4549831 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
4549832 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad

4549836 if a renewal by the same person is counted as a new issue to a different borrower that is misleading there has been an indication of this in the responses off line there have been far more worrying trends mentioned that inflate or massage the figures of use etc which have been happening for many many years and quite honestly astonishes and disappoints me i know we live in a number crunching world but these practices seemt to pre date that where performance tick box data is the norm but i just thought libraries were different and better
4549837 we are completely dependent on the commercial banks someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation cash or credit if the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous if not we starve we are absolutely without a permanent money system when one gets a complete grasp of the picture the tragic absurdity of our hopeless position is almost incredible but there it is it is the most important subject intelligent persons can investigate and reflect upon it is so important that our present civilization may collapse unless it becomes widely understood and the defects remedied soon

4549841 russia is indeed stronger and able to assume greater responsibility for solving problems on a regional and global scale
4549842 the habit of resorting to force is increasing in such circumstances it is important to maintain restraint and to evaluate situations carefully
4549843 i am convinced that with the end of the cold war the underlying reasons for most of the bloc politics and bloc discipline simply disappeared
4549844 we simply cannot accept the attempts taking place in individual countries to highlight the civilizing liberating mission of the fascists and their accomplices
4549845 it is those states that have such a passion for rewriting history and domestic and foreign policies that are at the same time the most zealous advocates of illegal acts like the kosovo precedent and those same states are the ones who have become ultra nationalist in their policies harassing national minorities and denying rights to the so called stateless citizens in their countries
4549846 for us this task is particularly important since in many cases we are talking about abuses against russians and russian speaking populations and protecting and defending those rights is obviously one of our responsibilities
4549847 i have focused on these aspects because europe today needs a positive rather than negative agenda
4549848 that is why we proposed to conclude a new treaty on european security and to start this process at a european wide summit
4549849 a strategic partnership between russia and the eu could act as the so called cornerstone of a greater europe without dividing lines
4549850 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement that will end this conflict

4549856 the value of crude oil and product imports would rise by 80 per cent to 138 2 billion while the value of product exports would rise similarly to 47 1 billion the projected value of merchandise exports and imports is 208 and 342 billion respectively leaving a bop merchandise trade deficit of 134 billion equivalent to 10 4 per cent of gdp a sizeable increase from 7 7 and 7 1 per cent in the last two years
4549857 the current account deficit cad is likely to expand to 41 5 billion equivalent to 3 2 per cent of gdp a major increase from 1 5 per cent of gdp

4549891 if 300 people are taken to denvers temporary detention facility within a short time frame processing those persons at the rate of 30 to 50 per hour would take at least 6 to 10 hours
4549892 during the republican national convention in new york city in 2004 nearly 1 100 people were arrested in a four hour period if a similar situation occurred in denver it would take at least 22 to 36 hours to process those persons

4549920 after looking at everything it looks like i had been there and just dont remember
4549921 reports from the front lines on the role of sound and digital media in an information based society
4549922 what happens when your website gets scandalously blocked in another country that you hardly ever even been to well most of the time youre screwed this time weve got great lawyers and the funny part is that tpb has never been particularily big in italy but since the block weve increased traffic from italy we gained 10 places on alexa in italy and our own stats show a 5 increase in traffic from italy which has been quite stable before
4549923 gwen did i go out last night i dont remember anything i was here trying to sleep

4549938 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
4549939 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4549940 his close aides approached the government and were clearly told that the only way to avoid impeachment is to step down the government does not want him to remain in the presidency
4549941 totally baseless and malicious recent spate of unsubstantiated news reports and rumours being spread that president pervez musharraf was resigning
4549942 they are just trying to put pressure on him to quit but he is not going to quit
4549943 from our standpoint it had many hours of broadcast time so it was exposed its not like it was stifled and no one heard it
4549944 in our opinion it was a business decision by disney you have to assume if disney thought theyd make money theyd release it
4549945 were pleased with the ruling and will proceed forward as appropriate
4549946 in addition to engaging in fraud deceit and trickery this court finds the governments tactics in this case are so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice
4549947 the government conduct identified by the district court as the grounds for dismissing the indictment simply has no relevance to these alleged offenses
4549948 it strikes us as highly incongruous to say the least for these proceedings to then be characterized as a sham engineered by the government
4549949 more broadly nothing in the record suggests that the naturalization interview was anything other than a bona fide examination conducted in accordance with the applicable regulations

4549970 of this group the vast majority constitute arab or muslim states
4549971 since islam prohibits proselytism by other religions foreign religious workers will in effect be denied entry to conduct religious work
4549972 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
4549973 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point
4549974 this gives us a better picture of what countries discriminate against us based on religion
4549975 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4549976 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4549977 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4549978 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it

4549985 rob and terri are unique people in the business world in general and without equal in the largely treacherous mortgage industry i recommend the mortgage insiders and the mortgage advantage without qualification

4549988 im the female jay z i never compared myself to other women artists i compared myself with the best and the best is jay z
4549989 when jay z knows who i am when he wants to work with me then ill have made it everyone else could go to hell then i ended up supporting him recently in the uk
4549990 i have developed an action plan that puts state resources to work immediately
4549991 my first priority is to protect vulnerable families and make sure everyone has access to the information and tools they need to prepare for winter
4549992 i have consulted with our experts on fuel assistance energy and human services and we are able to take significant action without an expensive and uncertain special session
4549993 if that changes i will use the full powers of the executive branch to address any emergency
4549994 our plan puts resources where they can be most effective between now and december
4549995 our plan is responsible and will help keep people safe and secure in their homes
4549996 in 2006 we were able to take quick action at the beginning of the legislative session to address low income fuel assistance
4549997 we also understand that increased food prices go hand in hand with higher energy costs
4549998 while we are working on energy issues we are mindful that we need to make sure families have access to healthy and nutritious foods
4549999 i feel sorry for that defensive back who thought he had an interception until julio jumped over him and swiped the ball from in front of his face
