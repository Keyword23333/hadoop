2640079 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital

2640094 i am going to take you through the belly of hell and i am going to reveal many things to you come follow me
2640095 ahead are many terrors they are not the figment of someones imagination but they are real be sure to tell your readers that demon powers are real tell them also that satan is real and the powers of darkness are real but tell them not to despair for if my people which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven and heal their lands and their bodies just as surely as heaven is real even so hell is also real
2640096 it will seem sometimes like i have left you but i will not remember that i have all power in heaven and in earth at times the evil spirits and lost souls will not see us or know we are here fear not what you are about to see is real these things are happening right now and will continue to happen until death and hell are cast into the lake of fire
2640097 what you are about to see and hear is true take heed you ministers of the gospel for these are faithful and true sayings awake evangelists preachers and teachers of my word all of you who are called to preach the gospel of the lord jesus christ if you are sinning repent or you will likewise perish
2640098 child there are many souls in torment here and there are many different types of torment for these souls
2640099 he was put here by satan and it is satan who torments him
2640100 lord i will now preach the true gospel i will tell about sin and hell but please help me out of here
2640101 this man was a preacher of the word of god
2640102 he said god would not send anyone to hell that god was too good to do that
2640103 my child it is better to have never known me than to know me and turn back from serving me
2640104 if only he had cared about his soul and the souls of others
2640105 he did not listen to me when i called he would not hear me he loved the easy life i called and called him to repentance but he would not come back to me one day he was killed and came immediately here now satan torments him for having once preached my word and saved souls for my kingdom this is his torment
2640106 the blood of many lost souls are upon this mans hands many of them are in torment here right now

2640124 georgian authorities actions in south ossetia are of course a crime and primarily a crime against its own people
2640125 by delivering a strike on georgias territorial integrity and thus by causing damage to its statehood its difficult to imagine how its possible to convince south ossetia to be part of georgia after the events which happened and continue to happen
2640126 the aggression led to numerous victims including among the peaceful population and provoked a real humanitarian catastrophe
2640127 and this is of course a crime against its own people
2640128 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
2640129 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
2640130 i do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies
2640131 towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict
2640132 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction
2640133 the city of tskhinvali no longer exists there is nothing left it was wiped out by the georgian military
2640134 our losses are mounting as many as 40 military servicemen killed and over 100 wounded
2640135 the losses are also mounting among civilian population in the cities
2640136 frankly we have not expected the russian invaders to hit our residential buildings to hit our peaceful cities to hit our peaceful citizens
2640137 from the legal point of view our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate
2640138 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are a crime of course primarily a crime against their own people
2640139 this aggression led to numerous casualties among civilians in particular and virtually caused a real humanitarian catastrophe and that is already a crime against the ossetian people
2640140 at the same time i would like to stress that georgia has always been greatly respected in russia and georgians regarded as brotherly people
2640141 we have managed to down 10 russian jets and one of the pilots has been captured alive and is being treated in a military hospital
2640142 we have also destroyed up to 30 russian tanks and heavy military vehicles
2640143 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2640144 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2640145 is not about south ossetia it has never been in the first place it is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace freedom and liberty
2640146 this unprovoked long time ago planned invasion and aggression must stop
2640147 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2640148 you will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart
2640149 draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you
2640150 seek first the kingdom and all of these things will be added to you
2640151 the only place outside heaven where you can be safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is hell
2640152 he who has will be given more and he who has not even what he lacks will be taken away
2640153 profits from our north american business have taken a severe hit
2640154 for an economic recovery to occur oil prices must fall and exports to the united states should recover the economic situation will improve around the april june period in 2009
2640155 i dont see an excess of capital investment so it wont be like the time after the economic bubble burst when capital investment and productivity declined 10 to 20 percent
2640156 depending oil price movement and overseas markets a scenario in which the economy wont recover past 2009 is possible
2640157 the japanese economy is solid and there arent any negative domestic factors i believe when overseas factors such as slowing u s economy and rising oil prices are solved the japanese economy will get better on its own
2640158 subliminal self evaluate its things towards not in a way see life the commend to attention as regards the leading edge in regard to the evaporate even so so that attend mass oneself outside hope benign neighborhood newspaper this unmusical condition has at most been brimming in company with rot beginning and end obsolete not buy and inner selfs punctually in in that statesmanlike equivalent lade ninety enneastyle percent respecting what happens swish the nfl is dulcet and late that combined percent isnt much as you say rather we hear tell of several close to that synthesized percent save we please to and fro the 99 percent and but now the self likely the observation is wein reference to starting the 99 percent and touch at hand that and getting distant for that diverse desiccate inner selfll make out number one shem impassioned without distinction bedlam in transit to solve this area started
2640159 never take your own revenge beloved but leave room for the wrath of god for it is written
2640160 its not surprising in the sense of how close the race is
2640161 but obama has really mastered the internet and the small gift hes just had money flooding in and for mccain to even be competitive is surprising to me
2640162 i dont think its that hes doing better than expected i think its that obama is doing worse than he would expect
2640163 how could bruneis olympic committee miss the deadline to register our athletes what do these people do theres a whole committee to look after two athletes everyone was there even iraq and afghanistan even the poorest countries in the world were there im so depressed
2640164 i feel a bit disgrace when our national flag is being carried by a foreign talent during the olympic opening ceremony why are we buying talents to bring an olympic medal back
2640165 we sent a little more than a dozen athletes most of whom perhaps were trained some place else to the biggest sporting event in the world i dont know with you but id say that reflects the pathetic state of philippine sports
2640166 i would put my praise on china for such an awesome fantastic bombastic acrobatic out of this world opening that i would have to rethink of any other nation that could ever beat the beijing games in years to come i am very much sure that there is a great sense of envy that china could build up such a spectacular show i had the feeling of pride swimming in my heart despite the host nation having little to none of connection to me i guess this is what they call one asia for the whole of asia
2640167 the opening ceremony was simply spectacular china really took this opportunity to inform the world about itself in some subtle ways the coming in of the athletes in the non conforming way of the usual alphabetical order i believe that this shows that china is prepared not to heed any rules but instead is ready to make its own rules in fact it already has for the world to follow
2640168 this awesome opening ceremony was simply mind blowing they captured my heart and thoughts from a sporting and world citizen perspective the crowds were simply superb the performances dazzling and spectacular showcasing how the inventions and creations of china helped to shape the world it certainly lived up to its reputation and promise to be the best olympics opening ceremony in history
2640169 its great to see a fellow asian country putting up such a wonderful spectacle but as the chinese spent millions to make sure their olympics is a success i cant help but think about the millions of people in darfur who are suffering because of the chinese continued sponsoring of the genocide there china may have staged the greatest olympic opening ceremony ever but they have to look at themselves for assisting in the death of hundreds of thousands of people thousand miles away
2640170 a celebration of sports and not a bad brew of politics
2640171 we shouldnt import too much of the calculations of politics into the striving of honest sportsmen let them show off their sporting skills
2640172 the vietnamese broadcaster didnt really say much about any of the countries until it got to the former soviet bloc he was talking about sergey bubka when ukraine was announced i guess all the communist countries know each other
2640173 ive waited for some time for the philippine delegation during the parade of participating countries unfortunately when the philippines time to show up came it only merited about three seconds on tv
2640174 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2640175 this race had been considered to be phelps toughest test but the american swimmer looked impressive all the way laszlo cseh of hungary took the silver in 4 06 16 while ryan lochte of the united states faded to third in 4 08 09 more than 4 seconds behind
2640176 hes not going to score 100 points and we hope to come close to scoring 100 points
2640177 i think you have to make sure that he doesnt dominate the game
2640178 the united states which includes kobe bryant and lebron james may the favorite but defending champion argentina world champion spain and european champion russia are also medal contenders
2640179 i turned around and thought i saw 4 31 on the board
2640180 i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31 but when i saw the clock said 4 29 i thought it was amazing
2640181 it was exciting my first medal in athens lane one and now here im excited
2640182 it was a tough race to finish and stephanie finished better it was a great time
2640183 it was definitely a tough race i cant really be mad i was only half a second off my best time
2640184 im really happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2640185 i was trying to fight back i just didnt have it in the end no problems with my nerves i was fairly relaxed i prepared well
2640186 im pretty happy with that it was a pretty emotional race
2640187 we were ready to leave the olympic games and we were waiting until very late for this decision
2640188 she told us we should stay in the best interest of the country

2640197 im going to approach this the same way i approached my football career
2640198 coming from jacksonville state to this level i was green i didnt have any bad habits to break because i didnt assume i had all the answers
2640199 when i was playing i would listen to the older guys and i would use what i got from them and would apply it to my game
2640200 im going to do the same thing with broadcasting im going to listen to the guys who came before me like keena as well as the producers and the directors
2640201 im going to take all the information that i can from them without trying to lose myself in the middle of all of that and add what ive learned to become a better broadcaster thats the plan
2640202 if you could play football thats all they cared about
2640203 they didnt care about the level that you came from or the size of the school they just wanted to know if you had the ability to fit into the system they were running
2640204 that was a big play because it completely set the tone for the game
2640205 i saw that i couldnt make a play on the ball in the air but i was there i read the route and i broke on it in time to be able to get my hands on it before mike irvin had a chance to secure the ball tim mcdonald was coming on his way to try and knock him out and he was able to fall on the ball
2640206 it was another one of those plays to let us know that it was our day after those plays it started to build and build and we knew there was no way we were going to leave candlestick without a win
2640207 what i vividly remember about that play was landing on the ground and separating my shoulder that hurt
2640208 it was just a deep ball to tony martin and it was one of those plays where you either get to the ball or they get a touchdown it could have been a big momentum swing for them going into the half
2640209 that was definitely a high point because that was what i was brought here for
2640210 thats why they brought all of us in for to win championships
2640211 i was a defensive player going against the offensive guys who i went against every day it was like practice
2640212 there were actually games where jerry rice and i would start a conversation for the first play we would shake hands and start a conversation wed line up and play the play and then on the way back to the huddle wed continue the conversation we were competing hard but that was the same way it was every day at practice
2640213 ive spent a lot of time coaching my son pretty much at whatever school hes been at i would come in and be the volunteer football coach my daughter is really the one that keeps me going with her softball she may be the best athlete in the family ive been trying to put as much time in with the kids as i possibly could
2640214 ive been carpool dad fieldtrip dad dad the coach and ive really enjoyed that
2640215 i moved back to the bay area about three years ago and it feels like home im really excited to be around the guys and the organization again and im excited to watch it grow back into what we all know its going to be again
2640216 when you see him on the sidelines in his coat and tie with that stern look on his face you would never ever think that the guy is as funny as he is i learned on the trip that hes an extremely funny man and hes a sharp football guy as a former player listening to him hes the type of guy you want to play for
2640217 im going to try and be me i think the best thing i could possibly do for anyone who is listening is to try and be myself
2640218 i dont want to be one of those guys whos always saying this is what i would have done and back when i played i did it this way im 40 now im far enough removed from the game to where i think i have perspective on it i can look at it and see it for what it is and respect the guys for what they do and the ability it takes to do it
2640219 thats the best teacher right there you make mistakes but you learn on the run it was very valuable
2640220 i just feel disgusted about the turnovers i guess would be the way i feel about how i played
2640221 other than those two plays i dont really remember anything else
2640222 just trying to do too much and not making a good decision thats what it comes down to
2640223 looking at it and looking back on it i think i could have flipped my hips real quick spun my feet around got my feet underneath me and made the throw
2640224 i probably would have taken a hit but i would have been more accurate instead i kind of tried to throw it on the run to the left and left it short
2640225 i would love to see more points on the board because thats the biggest measurement of all
2640226 we came away with just a couple of field goals so theres nothing to speak of in that respect
2640227 our seconds and thirds we had some faults on the run defensively
2640228 we had a breakdown when higgins ran it back on us everyone was out there trying to make things happen and make a tackle but we have to slow it down and have guys do their job
2640229 i was just trying to take points off the board
2640230 as the defense thats what we do anyway we can its better than them getting seven they got three we took points off the board because we didnt quit

2640243 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2640244 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2640245 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2640246 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31

2640248 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad

2640368 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2640369 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2640370 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2640371 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2640372 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2640373 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2640374 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2640375 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2640376 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2640377 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2640389 exchange based production existed in many pre capitalist societies before taking root in early modern europe because pre capitalist societies are fundamentally agrarian both exploiters and direct producers have access to their own means of subsistence as a result writes brenner their survival and reproduction is not dependent on the sale of their products on the market consequently they do not have to compete in terms of productive powers under these conditions the market exerts no pressure toward the continual revolution of the means of production according to brenner t he increase of relative surplus labor cannot become a systematic feature of such modes of production brenner also notes that there is a bias in pre capitalist societies toward the realisation of absolute as opposed to relative surplus value because labour is compulsory for serfs and slaves lords and masters tend to extract additional surplus labour by lengthening the working day or extending the corv e rather than through technological innovation as a result there is little reason to invest profits in the development of productive forces rather than being accumulated economic surplus is here systematically diverted from reproduction to unreproductive labor brenner following marx argues that capitalism emerges only when labourers are both free to sell their labour power on the market as a commodity and compelled to do so in order to survive

2640392 mr credit card here i am conducting a survey among personal finance investment bloggers about their credit cards and would appreciate if you would participate in this survey i would compile the results and publish it in my blog fyi i will not reveal your individual answers
2640393 mr credit card here during march and april i sent out an email to do a credit card survey in fact i sent out to over 150 pf bloggers 45 of you have responded to the survey and i want to thank all of you for that i want to thank you all once again in return for participating in this survey i will mention your blogs in a special post tomorrow hint its not just a post full of links
2640394 most pf bloggers who carry a balance and have credit card debt take advantage of 0 apr teaser deals to help them lower their interest cost
2640395 most only carry two credit cards and do not go crazy over having many credit cards
2640396 from this survey is that most pf bloggers make good use of their credit cards and could teach us a thing or two about credit cards
2640397 thats where chris and his mom live you know that was the third time id sold that house his mother borrowed 98 on it this one used to live there after she passed and he went to the nursing home their kids sold it and thats when cathy and frank bought it they borrowed 103
2640398 yeah more so for the banks because if the owners lose their jobs and cant pay the note then the bank can get stuck with a house that doesnt cover the debt a lot of banks wont do those thats why they had to go to such n such federal i cant believe they are doing those
2640399 if you cant put 10 down then youre not ready to buy the house ideally youll want to put down more like 20 the more you put down the lower your payment also the ability to put more down makes you less of a risk

2640569 it was good to come out and execute tonight i felt like weve had a really good camp and it was good to see that carry over tonight when the game started were a confident group and we feel like when we get the ball we have a good chance to score we got a lot of pressure from the defense and as a whole weve got a bunch of guys that have played a long time together and i think it showed tonight
2640570 i think the offense did well but obviously you can always get better i thought in that first drive we really went down and set the tempo and we were in and out of the huddle in each play really quick we ended up scoring on the first drive so it couldnt have been any better we still have a lot of work to do but i think we have this thing going the right way
2640571 without looking at the film yet i thought defensively we came out and had a good start we have a while before well have everything go the way we want it to go and we have some work to do but its still early so as long as everyone comes out healthy and keeps building and building well be alright
2640572 we have a long ways to go and we have a lot to work on but its a start and thats why its a preseason game

2640610 but we sometimes forget he got things done as governor and president that represented compromises if today you went to someone and outlined reagans record without using his name some conservatives would want to throw him out of the party but he never wavered on core principles and he made the country a better and more conservative place

2640630 i dont see any change in chelsea that is to me they dont look as if they are going to find acres of improvement simply because they are a very experienced team
2640631 but that experienced team can easily win the league because its not exactly disintegrating they are at their very peak i would think as a team so its much like the liverpool team of 89 exactly that same format of experience of that liverpool team
2640632 i know it was a very experienced team but thats the difficulty of football clubs whats helped chelsea is they have re energised the club by putting new managers in now phil scolaris come and it seems again is this a new dawning a new era new ideas how will he energise them but i dont think it will be much different to last season they could win the league and there wont be much in it again but i just hope we are the team that can improve more

2640644 granules on the photosphere of the sun are caused by convection currents of plasma within the suns convective zone the grainy appearance of the solar photosphere is produced by the tops of these convective cells and is called granulation
2640645 the rising part of the granules is located in the center where the plasma is hotter
2640646 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
2640647 although cosmologists have adopted a cute name dark energy for whatever is driving this apparently antigravitational behavior on the part of the universe nobody claims to understand why it is happening or its implications for the future of the universe and of the life within it despite thousands of learned papers scores of conferences and millions of dollars worth of telescope time it has led some cosmologists to the verge of abandoning their fondest dream a theory that can account for the universe and everything about it in a single breath
2640648 the discovery of dark energy has greatly changed how we think about the laws of nature
2640649 using our credibility as collateral that we as a community know what we are doing
2640650 in spite of the fact that you are liable to spend the rest of your lives measuring stuff that wont tell us what we want to know you should keep doing it
2640651 dark energy has the somewhat unusual property that it was embarrassing before it was discovered
2640652 it seems now that the answer is not really zero
2640653 i am tempted to say this was an embarrassment of my youth
2640654 this interpretation of string theory might be close to the truth
2640655 before the discovery of the dark energy quantum physicists tended to assume that the vacuum we live in has some deep meaning that reflects natures deepest secrets
2640656 our reward would be to go back to where we were not understanding the cosmological constant
2640657 as for how i feel personally i am not sure what to say
2640658 i wasnt terribly enthusiastic the first or even second time i heard the proposal of a multiverse but none of us were consulted when the universe was created
2640659 the biggest thing we could learn is by ruling that out
2640660 we have a suspect but were not ready to convict anyone yet
2640661 the challenge is to make dramatic improvements in the quality of the data
2640662 we can see dark matter and in principle even invisible clusters
2640663 cutting the budget in half would probably make the attainment of these goals impossible
2640664 if we dont answer that question we wont have learned a thing
2640665 you have a job to go knock on everyones door and say this is the opportunity of a lifetime

2640671 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2640672 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2640673 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2640674 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2640675 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2640676 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many

2640680 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2640681 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2640682 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2640683 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2640684 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2640685 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2640686 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2640687 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2640688 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2640689 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2640690 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2640691 i want to thank the giants for inviting all these great guys its weird for me not to be in uniform with the dodgers right there you heard me torre i beat you before and i can beat you again i havent retired thank you

2640711 i went online to find out what to do and what bus to take
2640712 the bus driver was very helpful and so were the other passengers
2640713 i enjoyed it it was just getting over that initial scariness
2640714 i got tired of figuring out where to park and walking from there to work there was no designated parking for us and if i wanted to park close to my office i had to pay quite a bit of money i found out the jo had a route that went right in front of my office
2640715 i like meeting all the people who ride the bus and ive developed friendships the neat part is the variety of people you meet on the bus we have people who bike to the oak park mall and then ride downtown its a good fraternity and sorority on the bus
2640716 you might have a new driver the weather might be bad or there might be a lot of people riding give it a couple days
2640717 i dont miss driving to work every once in while i drive in just to break the routine or if i want to stay late but i enjoy riding the bus
2640718 i wasnt familiar with the northland area i also rode the bus to save money

2640737 they want to use our breeders fund money to build these tracks but no one even wants them
2640738 we cannot properly train our dogs in west virginia because of the environment we need to take them to kansas or oklahoma to train them because there is flat land and clean air there
2640739 these tracks are going to encourage greyhound breeding in the state of west virginia this means we will have more dogs that are raised and trained in west virginia as opposed to having them imported from florida and other places
2640740 this will help us have more greyhounds raised in our state
2640741 what can i say the blues crowd has good taste
2640742 from the pre sales it looked like there was going to be a nice turnout
2640743 but maybe weve had a little more people than we expected
2640744 the repairs have been made and all the service has been restored
2640745 when we leave today it will all be done except for the blacktop
2640746 the breeders fund is set up to help us add to the economy of west virginia
2640747 after paying taxes buying food paying for veterinarian bills and paying about 20 employees i am not getting anywhere near that much
2640748 if a gas station sells 2 3 million worth of gas they surely are not bringing in that much as profit
2640749 the state is not subsidizing anything in the breeders funds
2640750 all of that money is generated from bets at the tracks whether it is from slot machines or tables or from the animals
2640751 if we are going to have greyhound racing in west virginia we need to support the industry
2640752 the racing industry was here before we had slots or table gambling i have no problem with keeping the horse and dog industries viable because it helps to provide a variety of entertainment at the tracks
2640753 i dont really know a lot about them it is something you dont hear a lot about in charleston
2640754 if it lets them have quality racing at the tracks it is good
2640755 the horse and dog industries are vital to our racetracks and must be taken care of we have to keep them going because they were here before the slot machines or table games
2640756 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2640757 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him

2640766 huh i wonder what kind of nefarious deeds these miscreants have perpetrated
2640767 the single most important thing you can do in businesses is be yourself
2640768 hes a real scrappy guy you look at him hes a smaller guy but he goes out and plays with a big heart
2640769 he just felt a little tweak i guess but i dont know
2640770 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
2640771 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
2640772 he threw the ball away which is one of those situations that we talked about
2640773 he made a couple nice throws there on some back shoulder throws
2640774 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2640775 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defense we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish
2640776 weve got to do a little better job of getting the defense off the field right now
2640777 it was a good touchdown for us and we got off to a good start
2640778 i threw some good balls but they made some good defensive plays
2640779 it was a good start and it felt good to be out there playing against someone else
2640780 it felt great for us as a team to move the ball that way
2640781 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2640782 we had a couple of missed formations a couple of forced passes a couple of inaccurate throws but thats going to happen in a preseason game thats why were playing these games we want to work those kinks out
2640783 those silver balls that you put on cakes that you arent supposed to bite
2640784 crees que limp bizkit es heavy ellos son the osmonds slipknot es algo m s heavy
2640785 we left the next day and we havent come back to las vegas since
2640786 when we get off the bus from the airport they meet us and hand us a coupon book and if you ask they will usually give you a comp
2640787 you cant give away as much as you used to thats a business model that doesnt work anymore
2640788 its not only more expensive for customers its more expensive for developers the cost of entry is too expensive
2640789 theres a piece of business thats being missed that doesnt want to pay 300 a night for a room
2640790 the vision we have for this wilderness camp lines up beautifully with the coastal land trust
2640791 they will stop at no expense to come after you
2640792 its hard enough to get victims to report domestic violence
2640793 we dont want to discourage them from taking out protective orders
2640794 but it also gives us tools to work with to try and get this person off the street
2640795 every victim who is in danger should take every precaution available to them
2640796 while the system is not perfect it is still a resource that they have
2640797 a lot of these women choose to be beaten regularly rather than get murdered once
2640798 you simply cannot stop someone when they want to harm another individual
2640799 it angers me that it just happens over and over and over again
2640800 even when its hard to be in an abusive situation you learn the signals enough to know what will come next
2640801 but when you leave a relationship you dont know what will come next whether they will be waiting around the corner for you
2640802 most people dont realize how prevalent it is until a tragedy happens
2640803 it looks like this year we are on a trend to have a higher number of homicides reported to us than last year
2640804 everyone around here who wanted to get one had to go to wilmington
2640805 the land consists of rolling forested uplands wetlands and marshes and is located in an area of extreme development pressure
2640806 were trying to do the best we can to protect as much land as we can
2640807 anytime you have development and impervious surfaces you have runoff
2640808 that first inning could have exploded into a disaster but i got out of that with just one run
2640809 i thought if we hung on and hung on wed get some whacks at this guy moehler
2640810 he doesnt have overpowering stuff but he was cutting it in there with a little bit of sink and kept us off balance
2640811 thats the second time he has thrown better than me
2640812 because like i say i dont know what to say we have two choices we can give up or keep fighting were still fighting im running out of things to come up with to say
2640813 bronson got out of that first inning against some tough hitters and when he did that i thought we had action on winning the ball game
2640814 but against moehler we took good pitches and it seemed when we swung it wasnt a very good pitch to hit we made him look like cy young
2640815 one run isnt going to get it done unless you shut em out and i havent seen one of those in a long time
2640816 it didnt look good he carried us the last month and a half its a big hole to fill but were capable of filling it im just now starting to suck it up
2640817 thats how i play how i was taught how i learned the only way i know how
2640818 its all about playing the game the right way no matter how bad it is and how bad it looks or how much you struggle as a team
2640819 not only me and joey votto but the whole team is going to be fun to watch for a long time and in the near future
2640820 i know fans are tired of hearing it but just be patient a little while longer
2640821 we have all the pieces and we just have to put it together i understand the fans thats fans for you but we as a team cant worry about that because we have to take care of our business this is a baseball town that has been spoiled in the past were not going to be the big red machine or anything but this team is going to be fun to watch for a very long time
2640822 thats the most fun i ever had in baseball last year when i did color commentary for espn on the little league world series those kids can play too they show exuberance and are fundamentally sound my wife watches and when those little boys cry she cries

2640835 back then being alive i was grateful for living everyday and i learned to be humble
2640836 i would rather say that there was a lack of effort to popularise the genre until now
2640837 after finishing graduate school i was appointed as a professor at a university and could have taken the easy and comfortable way toward success
2640838 i decided that i had to do something that i really wanted to do which is constantly creating and designing new art
2640839 back then being alive i was grateful for living everyday and i learned to be humble thats why my first show mainly had its theme on christianity
2640840 i really thank the show for making my creation this well known to the country i really didnt expect that kind of wild response from people
2640841 i think its bad news for the rudd government in canberra
2640842 if we can get a big swing like that away from labor than wa once again will have a good and honest government
2640843 we havent had any discussions as to who might come from the federal campaign
2640844 but dont forget in julie bishop with have the deputy leader of the federal liberal party
2640845 julie will be very active in this campaign from the very beginning
2640846 the mood is very positive people are saying they want to keep the territory on track he told reporters
2640847 this is incredibly serious because it could have led to loss of life its chilling
2640848 people are concerned about their safety but that is not affecting their work they are going to continue doing the research
2640849 this is the first attack on animal researchers we are aware of where there were children in the home
2640850 uc santa cruz may consider themselves an institution of higher education but they are also an institution of animal torture and killing
2640851 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age
2640852 there is no difference between waking up tomorrow and going to disneyland and waking up tomorrow and shooting yourself in the head with a gun
2640853 those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires but those who live in accordance with the spirit have their minds set on what the spirit desires the mind of sinful man is death but the mind controlled by the spirit is life and peace the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to gods law nor can it do so
2640854 for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor so that you through his poverty might become rich

2640861 i wanted to serve a mission in a bad way
2640862 but i came out as gay moved to portland told my story to the home teacher and a few months later i was excommunicated
2640863 the thing i always wanted was for someone to stand up for me at church but no one did
2640864 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2640865 there are probably some workplaces where the f word is commonly used but it has no place in negotiations between employers and employees about wages and conditions
2640866 and as for you jennifer asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
2640867 if it was up to me i would close the shop for a week sack everyone and rehire everyone people who do care about my business
2640868 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately thereafter
2640869 this threat made by mr martinoski was made in anger and on the spur of the moment nonetheless his language and conduct at the time of the threat were offensive and bullying
2640870 theyve extrapolated their own view that the f word is banned thats not the case
2640871 you would think in a nice pristine environment no one would be swearing but the fact of life is it does happen
2640872 it would be nice to have a lovely atmosphere but sometimes that breaks down lets not have more political correctness heaped on to stuff weve already got
2640873 two police officers and a security guard were injured and two police cars were destroyed
2640874 open up the white school we want to get in the white school we want to go where the books are or computers are
2640875 striking at the very heart of the political power structure in illinois state sen james meeks d chicago on thursday threatened to put protesting public schoolchildren in the lobbies of every business in downtown chicago including the chicago mercantile exchange if weve got a problem everybodys got a problem meeks told more than a thousand cheering supporters at a rally to reform public school funding in this state
2640876 james s coleman the educational sociologist concludes in a new federally financed study that private high schools provide a better education than public high schools
2640877 these findings are expected to strengthen the support of tuition tax credits for parents whose children attend parochial or other private schools
2640878 once childrens basic material needs are met characteristics of their parents become more important to how they turn out than anything additional money can buy
2640879 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically

2640882 i will only appear to support offshore drilling and hope my clever wording will get me elected
2640883 if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective polices that is a conversation i am happy to have
2640884 if i sound confident and tough right now i can come up with an excuse not to meet mccain later i have no substance i hope my empty rhetoric will get me elected
2640885 so what they are going to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like those other presidents on the dollar bills
2640886 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist
2640887 i hope denying my obviously false and desperate allegation of racism will get me elected
2640888 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some white people to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
2640889 why settle for a little cash i hope to ride white guilt to the white house and beyond
2640890 my staff both complimented and admonished ludacris i hope my lack of guts to take a stand personally on what is moral and just will not hurt my chances of getting elected
2640891 i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest instead im going to try to tell the american people what i believe will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testament to my patriotism
2640892 worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing
2640893 it is not for sale but it is yours you are the master and alone are worthy of it
2640894 ill never play covers but i hate my day job
2640895 i only play lead but i cant find enough gigs
2640896 im going to play to make this gig a success
2640897 the biggest competition going on right now is between the seconds and thirds whos going to make up the list
2640898 with as many players as we have with returning experience a lot of those positions are kind of set
2640899 younger players knew from the get go they were going to get a lot of reps a lot of the older guys werent going to play that much
2640900 t j stepped up 83 had a big day for us
2640901 terrell he played pretty well today he had a lot of catches
2640902 i just feel like some people came out and did some good things but theres also some things weve got to work on
2640903 im just trying to go out there and do my best to where i can fit in and help the team out thats all that really matters
2640904 i think it was our first good scrimmage of the summer since ive been here
2640905 just moving the ball the defense was getting good stops but weve still got a lot of work before aug 30 weve got to get better on both sides of the ball weve got to cut back on penalties
2640906 were not happy we lost but were happy we did what we had to do until the end
2640907 thats all you can do go out with a positive attitude and still play hard
2640908 if not for the win for yourself and for your teammates
2640909 when youre on the field for a long time it tends to wear on you
2640910 they had seven in the box and they kept blitzing
2640911 we didnt start picking it up until the second half by that time we were too far behind to catch back up
2640912 weve got five games left and we can still make the playoffs
2640913 we still could go 6 5 its not a long shot we just got to go to practice and execute
2640914 from what we see you may have one out of 10 women that walk in that happen to be wearing the right bra size
2640915 every time you lose or gain a few pounds it changes the bra size
2640916 menopause taking certain medications just going through pregnancy can change your size
2640917 if you had one bra that you wore each day and you hand washed it each day it might last six months
2640918 you could have a dance on this stump im going to call bob timberlake he loves stuff like this were also going to see if we can get it in a museum up in raleigh
2640919 ill bet its the biggest saw in eastern north carolina too
2640920 this tree was in a good place and had few stressful years until this one at least if it could only turn over its diary
2640921 but all vendors contractors everybody we work with had to be notified and that has been done
2640922 it is a change in the way we think about the people we serve and a significant move toward supporting regionalism
2640923 i still get an occasional letter addressed to simmons nott airport so it will probably be long after im gone before coastal carolina regional airport is the name everybody uses
2640924 but people dont look for an airport in our region through the county name our web site uses new bern
2640925 ill write a little something about it maybe thatll help
2640926 what were doing tonight is bringing great entertainment to the public and what theyre doing in return is make a contribution to us
2640927 this is a fundraiser not a charitable fundraiser its a great concert for all ages too
2640928 this is great that i get to have a heck of a time hear some great music and help out the wonderful shriners who do so much for the children
2640929 its a good time for a good cause im just waiting on that johnny dollar band to hit that stage
2640930 this is different than playing a greenville club on a saturday night or a wedding
2640931 our original drummer grew up around the shriners this is about having a good time and raising a lot of money for them we also donate ourselves at the end of events giving the shriners money from our t shirt sales
2640932 they have problems with rezoning and a reluctance to initially zone property to high density
2640933 they have felt that the city is better served with a larger lot size and they worry about what might be created if a high density area is allowed a couple of years ago they asked us to take a look at the rules that we have on subdivisions
2640934 were still trying to learn how to use the scorecard in all honesty
2640935 the first model we had was so cumbersome that we recently trimmed it back we havent used it to say no to any project but we have used it to send a project back to a developer to say that it needs more work
2640936 of course the environmental aspect is very high on the list
2640937 we really look at that twice once when were looking at the location aspect and then again separately in its own sort of category environmental is a big one
2640938 one thing that may seem sort of odd is the density factor because there are areas that you might look at that appear very dense which might seem contrary to the smart growth goal
2640939 but the idea is to cluster density where it is appropriate as a way to ultimately discourage urban sprawl
2640940 youre looking at making a community walkable and youre also looking for at least two different kinds of housing so that you dont end up with a sort of exclusive neighborhood
2640941 we basically look at the whole of the project and see if we find it good overall or bad overall
2640942 the goal isnt to be unfriendly to the developer but to encourage the strengths of the project and work on the weaknesses so that we all end up happy
2640943 it probably would have passed our subdivision ordinance but didnt do well on the scorecard
2640944 the scorecard is not incorporated into the ordinance at this point but it is clearly a planning policy that we intend to follow
2640945 i think if we had some clear definitions and clear boundaries that would help us tremendously
2640946 it would clear up a lot of confusion as these proposals stand now a developer could go in and believe that he had everything exactly right only to be turned down by the planning staff or the historic preservation commission
2640947 ive already heard talk of developers who intend to go to jones county now instead of coming to new bern
2640948 what happens with a plan like this is that you price out good people from being able to live in the city if you tell a developer that he has to have a certain number of porches or extra concrete or whatever that cost has to go somewhere and it gets passed on to the buyer
2640949 i think you need to look at them really close
2640950 four years ago i hadnt even built a rabbit box
2640951 i can tell you what i do know if you price a developer like me out of the market you price a buyer out of the market too
2640952 this is certainly something that is on the national smart growth agenda
2640953 require us to reinvent the fields of urban design and architecture
2640954 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

2640990 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2640991 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2640992 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2640993 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2640994 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2640995 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2640996 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2640997 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2640998 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2640999 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2641000 he arrives at the bank and finds it in his car so the likelihood is it was placed when the car was elsewhere
2641001 in my mind it could have been any errand he was running it just happened to be the bank
2641002 we have one left because he was too big to fit through the hole
2641003 they need all sorts of special lighting special food and special care
2641004 thats something that stood out in bay not only was he a good player but he had great makeup was really driven
2641005 hes got that makeup you like to see in players no fear of failure
2641006 all i was looking for at that point was a chance basically to prove not to anyone else but to myself if i cant do it im at least going to get out there and try
2641007 i would have been devastated if i hadnt gotten that chance
2641008 it was one something that i hit and it was a soft one something
2641009 the team called me in and said they were going to send me down to low a which was pretty devastating
2641010 im thinking 22nd round draft pick down here my ticket probably isnt going to last much longer
2641011 it was for a little higher profile player it was like getting drafted a little bit higher each time that was the way i took it somebody wants me
2641012 we needed kind of a marquee player opening up our new park
2641013 if we wouldnt have been going into our new ballpark we probably never would have made the trade
2641014 rioters hang another negro mobs in springfield ill defying 3 000 soldiers string up old and innocent victim
2641015 every time she went to the hospital she always got an infection
2641016 we are doing our best to implement the law in new hampshire within the constraints of our resources always keeping in mind the health and safety of our population thats our aim our mission our job
2641017 i do agree we need to get data out there people shouldnt get infections in hospitals
2641018 we will report if the state tells us to and comes up with a definition and methodology this is not in the hospitals court its in the states court
2641019 whats becoming clear to us is that we need to avoid participating in the information chaos thats happening around the country
2641020 i think its fair to say that it is in the best interest of the new hampshire hospital association to stonewall any effort that would facilitate the reporting of infection rates that could potentially shed a negative light on any one hospital
2641021 hospital executives in this state are guilty of negligence in not providing a meaningful solution to this deadly problem
2641022 because he was very active raising money over the two years prior to his reelection in 2007
2641023 we have every intention of raising money at the appropriate time
2641024 but you know up until these last several months ive just been focusing on being mayor of the city
2641025 its not polite to ask people for money when teachers are possibly being laid off
2641026 advancing good government and fiscal responsibility in the state of new hampshire
2641027 if there isnt a quorum on the school board does that make it a legal meeting
2641028 nobody should read into this that school board members were not interested in this issue thats just not the case
2641029 nobody likes to increase costs on families thats for sure
2641030 a lot of people are hesitant to be the first person to stick their neck out because theyre usually the first ones to get their heads cut off
2641031 this gives them the piece of mind that theyre not going to be harassed or terminated for being the whistle blower
2641032 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2641033 the decision to go to the middle east to fight for oil led me to a decision to do something for the world
2641034 the tipping point was 2007 when wall street got behind solar manufacturers
2641035 i want to show people that solar can be effective here in new england
2641036 those great sunny winter days are great for the production of electricity
2641037 you have to be intimately involved with maintaining the power system
2641038 we really need to start creating our own energy sources here in the u s
2641039 were starting to recover from our addiction to fossil fuel
2641040 its tough at first having to accept that youve just lost and youre going home no more baseball for the rest of the year
2641041 but we absorbed it after 10 15 minutes now were the same team we were before the game
2641042 ive been catching for him all season hes always been a great pitcher
2641043 during practice the coaches kept telling me to keep my head down and have a nice easy swing
2641044 i just listened to them and got a good piece of the ball
2641045 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2641046 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2641047 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2641048 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge

2641051 id like to believe that this is all gods plan rest sa tv at pelikula naman and i think thats a good thing sa tv may naka lineup naman kaso lahat naman ngayon bago pa ang soap wala pa namang natatapos so well see
2641052 nagpapapayat nagpapaganda diet nagpupunta ako ng gym minsan tumatakbo sa village minsan kinakain ko lang oatmeals
2641053 i think it was really a well deserved break in a way parang okey rin happy rin naman ako na napahinga naman ako for a while actually i dont know nga why people are making it a big issue e wala lang naman unfortunately na hospital ako i gained weight so i had to lose the weight bago ako lumabas
2641054 dyusko naman may nabubuntis na nga ngayon ng tatlong buwan lang ewan ko sa kanila hayaan nyo na yun kumbaga lahat naman ng tao may masasabi at masasabi hindi mo naman matatanggal yun at saka kapag hindi ka pinag uusapan hindi ka sikat
2641055 i mean thats the truth di ba especially in this business matakot ka kung hindi ka na pinag uusapan at saka ang tanda tanda na natin sa business na ito memorize na natin yan kung hindi ka nabuntis nagpa rehab ka addict ka kung hindi naman nagpalaglag wala ka nang magagawa tanggapin na lang natin
2641056 okey na actually in a way sabi ko nga sa mommy ko dorothy laforteza baka god really wanted me to get hospitalized because in the long run hindi rin naman kasi magiging maganda for my health yung every time na mina migraine ako ini injection an ako
2641057 umabot na rin kasi sa point na masyado ng matapang ang pain killer na ini inject sa akin hindi na nag e effect thats the reason why i have to stay at the hospital longer kasi ginawan nila ako ng cycle parang from 100 mg every day down to 50 30 hanggang sa no more na
2641058 actually kaya rin naman ako nasanay magpa inject dahil din sa mga taping ko hindi puwedeng mag pack up e kapag nagpapa inject sa hospital in 30 minutes magaling ka na so kumbaga in a way baka god wanted me rin to do something kasi nakakatakot if ill get dependent sa medication maa addict ka talaga and its not good for everyone
2641059 im glad that i have to go through something like that baka sine save lang ako ni god kasi hindi rin magiging maganda ang effect sa system ko at si mom nakakahinga na siya kapag sumasakit ang ulo ko tablet na lang okey na
2641060 nakakatakot talaga kasi ang sa akin noon demerol then after ng demerol whats next morphine na so its not really healthy
2641061 wala rin panghihinayang ako kasi naniniwala ako na lahat naman ng nangyayari sa buhay ng tao lahat yan may dahilan whether naiintindihan mo or hindi but eventually nga things will always turn out the best for you naman
2641062 i think that whats god wants me to go through and nag break muna ako sa tv and now im going to do naman a movie so okey lang i dont mind di ba masaya

2641067 the rising costs the economy its hard for a lot of them some of these families have six kids

2641069 they came and helped me and i liked what they did
2641070 isnt sports suppose to train one in building character and winning in competitions isnt the ultimate goal but rather going through the training learning and improving on ones technique and enhancing ones fitness level are the benefits which outweighs receiving a medal
2641071 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
2641072 any translation of john 1 1 that obscures this emphasis on mind or reason is a bad translation and if anyone complains that the idea of ratio or debate obscures the personality of the second person of the trinity he should alter his concept of personality in the beginning then was logic
2641073 it is the same with my word i send it out and it always produces fruit it will accomplish all i want it to and it will prosper everywhere i send it
2641074 so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth it shall not return to me empty but it shall accomplish that which i purpose and shall succeed in the thing for which i sent it
2641075 for i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day
2641076 i glorified you on earth having accomplished the work that you gave me to do
2641077 key is to strike a balance between wants amp needs
2641078 fue un rival complicado sobre todo al inicio creo que de arranque jugamos bien despu s nos falt manejar mejor el partido y al final con el 2 0 salimos sufriendo era un partido para jugar mucho mejor
2641079 sin ser brillantes merecidamente nos adjudicamos el triunfo hay mucho por trabajar creo que en cada partido hay cosas positivas y detalles para seguir trabajando
2641080 la prioridad siempre ser mantener el cero porque te da la ventaja de hacer un gol busqu con los cambios dar rotaci n ya que tengo un plantel extenso la prioridad fue darle la rotaci n al conjunto porque hay jugadores que ven an de participar en dos partidos intensos y muchos necesitan la oportunidad de mostrarse el equipo de inicio y con los cambios me gust y seguir teniendo mucho trabajo para decidir las alineaciones en el futuro
2641081 the olympics have become a catalyst for sweeping changes beijing was transformed architecturally historically and even temperamentally for china the olympics is more than a sporting event it is as much about prestige and international acceptance

2641086 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2641087 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2641088 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2641089 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
2641090 i am sure a lot more people would like to buy it but currently cant do so i have no idea why they apple did it retire the application and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the app store the app is a work of art and included a secret mantra thats all
2641091 in the west i saw islam but saw no muslims
2641092 and if i test positive there why ban you can take my life as well
2641093 the tests have no validity because the indian lab is not accredited by the world anti dope agreement it does not follow procedures the report was released internally and we have not been given a copy

2641097 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2641098 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers

2641100 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2641101 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market

2641109 god was in christ reconciling us unto himself not imputing our trespasses unto us
2641110 christ also hath suffered for sin the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god
2641111 yes we believe in election yes we believe in effectual call yes we believe in total depravity yes we believe in perseverance but we do not believe that the death of christ along with his other works as surety is sufficient effectual and all that is necessary for the redemption of his elect
2641112 him who loved us and washed us from our sins in his own precious blood
2641113 he that trusts in his own heart is a fool
2641114 eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit
2641115 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things
2641116 by the grace of god i am what i am
2641117 god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ
2641118 marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again
2641119 what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul
2641120 if any man ascribes anything of salvation even the very least thing to the free will of man he knows nothing of grace and he has not learned jesus christ rightly

2641123 a lot of my friends are sardarjis im very fond of them for their lifestyle and daring ive never done a film that would hurt any communitys feelings quite frequently i get rid of potentially funny scenes when i feel theyre offensive i want to distribute love not hatred through my cinema
2641124 i personally approached major sikh communities to watch singh is kinng they pointed out scenes that were not quite right we recalled akshay kumar from south africa and re shot those scenes then the sikhs were quite happy
2641125 our intentions cannot be doubted people who saw the film on wednesday say singh is kinng is better than my no entry and welcome my wife thinks this is my best work to date and my children love it thats a relief if people in my home dont like a film how can i expect people outside to like it
2641126 ill say only one thing ive made a very good film its a much bigger film than my no entry and welcome but i wasnt thinking of those films while making singh is kinng i didnt want to repeat the earlier formula for the first time ive incorporated action scenes in my cinema i dont like action but because of akshay we had to include it
2641127 i go before the release of all my films and spend four five days in ajmer sharif im able to overcome my nervousness there
2641128 i dont make four films a year i make one film every two years so ive no immediate project to fall back on ive put my entire life in singh is kinng
2641129 vipul loves and respects me thats why he approached me id love to do another film with him if vipul didnt have confidence in me why would he let me direct hed have done it himself
2641130 i normally shoot one film at a time its because of my producer vipuls planning that i could complete and release singh is kinng eight months after my last release welcome
2641131 you have 1 1 2 weeks to win gold you have less than that to become a team

2641133 el capitalista de sombrero de copa y puro de lujo entre los labios a menudo dotado de una nariz llamativamente curva desapareci para siempre del escenario
2641134 su lugar lo ocupa ahora dice enzensberger el ejecutivo moderno rico y educado que debe privarse de la bebida y del tabaco y ce irse a un r gimen estricto
2641135 un n mero creciente de pobres diablos desvalidos que apenas saben leer y escribir remarca enzensberger con iron a ya no encuentra quien los explote una sociedad de clases se mire por donde se mire
2641136 quise quedar primero para asegurarme la cuarta calle en la final
2641137 cuando estoy nadando me puedo relajar bastante sea a costa de reducir la fuerza o la intensidad del batido de piernas o de no empujar tan fuerte con los brazos
2641138 as es como me dosifico en las series preliminares s lo hago lo necesario para meterme en la final
2641139 ahorra energ a porque su t cnica es mejor que la de cualquier nadador en la historia y tiene una base f sica natural que refinamos y trabajamos desde que ten a 11 a os
2641140 en la mariposa su brazada no se parece a la de nadie y adem s es capaz de mantenerla durante largos periodos sin agotarse demasiado puede nadar muy r pido con menos reclamo de energ a no s exactamente por qu es capaz de esto pero lo hace porque lo cierto es que no entrena tanto garantizo que ha entrenado menos la mariposa que el resto de los mejores mariposistas del r nking
2641141 durante las carreras produce cido l ctico m s tarde que el resto llega m s lejos aer bicamente a una velocidad superior sus pruebas de estilo son tan buenas porque puede nadar la mariposa durante 55 segundos sin gastar apenas energ a mientras que los dem s se tienen que matar para ir a la misma velocidad tiene una ventaja autom tica porque puede nadar los primeros 100 sin ir a tope hasta que no nada la braza y el libre apenas usa las piernas se las ahorra consigue mantener una muy buena posici n del cuerpo y un buen ritmo sin dar muchas batidas no creo que mucha gente consiga hacer eso la mayor a tienen que patear realmente duro
2641142 entonces uno se sienta frente a la televisi n ve un partido vuestro aunque sea por casualidad y acaba enganch ndose
2641143 nos quitas la garra y el coraz n y no somos nada enganchamos a la gente
2641144 la derrota entraba dentro de lo posible el equipo tiene gente joven hab a ansiedad
2641145 los xitos del equipo masculino nos han venido fenomenal nos han salpicado de manera positiva pero no se puede comparar no digo que ellos no lo tengan pero a nosotras nos quitas la garra el coraz n el car cter y no somos nada precisamente por eso enganchamos a la gente porque podemos ir perdiendo por 20 puntos y no nos rendimos y somos capaces de remontar
2641146 la derrota entraba dentro de lo posible el equipo es nuevo con gente joven hab a ansiedad
2641147 nos viene una generaci n de ganadoras de jugadoras que aportan m s cent metros y con mucho talento lo demuestran hasta en los entrenamientos en los que son muy competitivas nosotras ramos algo as como el ej rcito de pancho villa y ahora nos han llegado jugadoras mucho m s estilosas
2641148 hay que hacer lo posible por quedar entre las tres primeras en nuestro grupo me parece que la primera del otro ser australia que est a un nivel superior a las dem s las podemos ganar incluso a rusia como ya hicimos hace poco en un amistoso de preparaci n
2641149 deseamos ilusionar a la gente con nuestro juego y para eso debemos llegar lo m s lejos posible en un torneo en el que varias selecciones optamos a subir al podio

2641163 to the c students i say you too can be president of the united states
2641164 well i just think its a bad idea whats going to happen is theyre going to be over there for 10 15 maybe 20 years
2641165 explain to the mothers and fathers of american servicemen that may come home in body bags why their son or daughter have to give up their life
2641166 the president is once again releasing american military might on a foreign country with an ill defined objective and no exit strategy he has yet to tell the congress how much this operation will cost and he has not informed our nations armed forces about how long they will be away from home these strikes do not make for a sound foreign policy
2641167 if we are going to commit american troops we must be certain they have a clear mission an achievable goal and an exit strategy
2641168 i had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginning i didnt think we had done enough in the diplomatic area
2641169 i cannot support a failed foreign policy history teaches us that it is often easier to make war than peace this administration is just learning that lesson right now the president began this mission with very vague objectives and lots of unanswered questions a month later these questions are still unanswered there are no clarified rules of engagement there is no timetable there is no legitimate definition of victory there is no contingency plan for mission creep there is no clear funding program there is no agenda to bolster our over extended military there is no explanation defining what vital national interests are at stake there was no strategic plan for war when the president started this thing and there still is no plan today
2641170 no goal no objective not until we have those things and a compelling case is made then i say back out of it because innocent people are going to die for nothing thats why im against it
2641171 i had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginning i didnt think we had done enough in the diplomatic area
2641172 you think vietnam was bad vietnam is nothing next to kosovo
2641173 im on the senate intelligence committee so you can trust me and believe me when i say were running out of cruise missles i cant tell you exactly how many we have left for security reasons but were almost out of cruise missles

2641179 los juegos de 1992 supusieron la extensi n de la pr ctica deportiva en la ciudad su vocaci n por ser sede de acontecimientos deportivos internacionales y ahora queremos ser la sede en que se reflexione sobre lo que supone esta actividad en la sociedad actual
2641180 el deporte es un factor central para una ciudad moderna la filosof a es crear un di logo en torno al mundo del deporte
2641181 es que todos los ciudadanos tengan una instalaci n deportiva a menos de 10 minutos andando desde su domicilio
2641182 se celebrar del 26 de julio al 1 de agosto de 2010 competir n 1 500 atletas de m s de 50 pa ses y habr cerca de 13 000 acreditados
2641183 as como barcelona no estuvo sola cuando afront el reto ol mpico ahora barcelona estar con madrid si espa a puede obtener los juegos ol mpicos el deporte espa ol y catal n dar n un gran paso adelante
2641184 era imposible que el coraz n me fuera m s r pido luch todo lo que pude
2641185 trabajas dur simo durante cuatro a os y desaprovechar todo eso justo antes de la competici n es un desastre es lo que hice yo en los juegos de barcelona 1992 fui una turista intentaba hacerme fotos con el rey juan carlos saltaba sobre sillas para lograrlo y persegu a a boris becker para fotografiarme con l cuando entr en la piscina ya estaba cansada mi concentraci n estaba en otro lugar
2641186 hay que centrarse en una misma s lo en la carrera de una no en las rivales se es mi consejo para una joven nadadora
2641187 eso hace la gran diferencia te pasan muchas cosas que te pueden afectar especialmente cuando eres joven
2641188 hay que trabajar fuera de la piscina en seco esto no consiste s lo en meter las piernas en el agua
2641189 en unos juegos hay que guardar parte de tu entusiasmo y centrarse en nadar ser a est pido ponerse a hacer fotos a buscar a gente famosa en el comedor eso en la segunda semana
2641190 es que no puede ser si lo tengo dicho este sistema de competici n no es justo
2641191 nos fren la preparaci n as que podemos estar muy contentos del nivel que ha mostrado
2641192 pero qu has de hacer para meterte en la final
2641193 t no has clavado el segundo y yo s y a ti te punt an m s alto
2641194 me alegro por gervasio pero no me han puntuado como merec a porque lo he hecho mejor que l estoy decepcionado el problema es que no quer an a dos espa oles en la final
2641195 rendimos mucho m s por la tarde de hecho normalmente en madrid a las nueve de la noche estamos entren ndonos todav a es una cuesti n fisiol gica que no hemos cuantificado pero seguro que la diferencia de rendimiento es muy grande
2641196 nos adelantamos nos levantamos a las siete y media empezamos los entrenamientos m s temprano com amos antes
2641197 las puntuaciones son m s fr as porque los jueces temen puntuar muy alto no vaya a ser que terminen por la tarde llenando la competici n de dieces
2641198 qingdao abre mucho el panorama eso es lo divertido puede que vayas el 14 pero tienes opciones con un r gimen tan flaco de viento todo puede cambiar en un momento
2641199 en el desayuno no hay alimentos b sicos como cereales leche desnatada y yogures hay poca variedad de frutas y algunas comidas son muy picantes
2641200 me sorprende coughlin c mo ha podido crecer tanto esta ni a

2641208 por lo menos ha ganado yoana y el b dminton espa ol
2641209 te deja mal cuerpo porque es una experiencia nica y me la perd pero no ten a otro remedio hab a que descansar para el partido
2641210 he preparado a conciencia el partido y ha salido perfecto tengo justo lo que buscaba
2641211 haber roto el maleficio haber ganado el primer partido en unos juegos es como para otros deportes lograr el oro
2641212 not that i planned for god tussi and chamku to come one after another but fortunately i look very different in both in god tussi im dressed in shorts and jeans i wear a nose ring throughout the film a very hip and today thing to do in chamku im a schoolteacher so im dressed in saris

2641214 bobby and i go back a long way he and sunnyji sunny deol are a part of my initial phase in mumbai sunnyji did my first film the hero with me when i was a nobody he didnt have to but he encouraged a newcomer ill never forget that
2641215 as for bobby weve done two films together before id do anything for the deols banner vijeta films any time
2641216 el dolor era insoportable pero yo s lo quer a que me colocaran el hombro y seguir el combate
2641217 sab a que me pod a ocurrir lo que ha pasado pero en los ltimos tiempos con ejercicios de fortalecimiento y una hombrera especial no me hab a encontrado mal
2641218 no s si hubiera ganado yo me ve a con opciones de pon rselo muy dif cil porque le hab a pillado el truquillo
2641219 si la rival te supera pues vale abandonar por una lesi n qu pena
2641220 estaba muy disgustada pero no hemos podido hacer nada el m dico es el que manda
2641221 estoy en la cola de la villa para hacerme una foto con rafa nadal desde luego l y gasol no se me escapan en el desfile de la ceremonia de apertura

2641293 during this phase of the operation there is going to be no direct contact by units of the abkhazian forces thus far our troops have not entered the sector controlled by georgian formations therefore we were quite amazed to hear saakashvilis claim that the georgian forces had repelled attacks in the kodor gorge
2641294 we observed a build up in forces the georgian side doubled the size of their contingent also there was a deployment of artillery pieces and multiple rocket launchers
2641295 to drive the georgian forces from the upper reaches of the kodor gorge
2641296 following the orders of president bagapsh we decided to move our forces into the dmz in the galsky raion
2641297 were perfectly legal abkhazia repeatedly offered to resolve matters by compromise through diplomatic channels never by force however the barbarous actions of georgia in the last 24 hours give us the right to act as the situation warrants it the blame lies completely on the georgian side we sought a diplomatic solution in fact i was busy doing that myself we had many talks with western diplomats explaining the situation to them however we had to see to our military preparations we decided to move our units to the georgian border and initiate operations so as to divert as many units of the georgian forces away from the positions of our south ossetian brothers early in the morning our units advanced into the dmz previously banned to both the georgian and abkhazian forces per previously negotiated agreements in accordance with their standing orders the russian troops of the peacekeeping force stopped our columns so that they would not break the agreement a request along this line also came from the russian foreign ministry our government said that it respected the agreement concerning kodor gorge but future actions would depend on the development of the situation and the actions of the georgians since the georgian forces intensified their bombardment of tskhinvali we decided to shell georgian military targets
2641298 thus far we have not started this for we have not found it to be necessary yet

2641368 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2641369 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2641370 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2641371 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2641372 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2641373 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2641374 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2641375 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2641376 we are building a renewed model of priesthood for a renewed roman catholic church in a community of equals in which all are welcome at the sacred eucharistic table
2641377 there is no punishment there is nothing the institutional church can do to stop this movement
2641378 the roman catholic diocese of lexington condemned the roman catholic womenpriests movement as in opposition to the churchs authentic teaching and warned that members of the catholic faithful should not support or participate in saturdays event
2641379 the event the diocese said has no connection to roman catholic liturgy or sacraments and cannot in any way be recognized as a valid reception of sacred orders
2641380 im from the cove city of two hundred and forty years from now
2641381 that would be a d twenty two hundred and one wouldnt it
2641382 its part of a megalopolis now and extends all the way to there
2641383 two thousand and fortieth street runs straight through that grove of sugar maples
2641384 and do you see that stand of locusts over there
2641385 thats where the new plaza is its supermarket is so big that it takes half a day to go through it and you can buy almost anything in it from aspirins to aerocars and next to the supermarket where that grove of beeches stands is a big dress shop just bursting with the latest creations of the leading couturiers i bought this dress im wearing there this very morning isnt it simply beautiful
2641386 oh yes this is my favorite space time coordinate i stand here for hours sometimes and look and look and look day before yesterday i saw a rabbit and yesterday a deer and today you
2641387 if you always return to the same point in time
2641388 the reason is because the machine is affected by the passage of time the same as anything else and you have to set it back every twenty four hours if you want to maintain exactly the same co ordinate i never do because i much prefer a different day each time i come back
2641389 hed like very much to come if he only could but i tell him all about what i see
2641390 and its almost the same as if he really came wouldnt you say it was
2641391 theyre a boon to people who like to stand on pleasant leas in the twenty third century there arent very many pleasant leas left
2641392 there arent very many of them left in the twentieth i guess you could say that this one is sort of a collectors item ill have to visit it more often
2641393 im staying in a cabin about three miles back im supposed to be on vacation but its not much of one my wife was called to jury duty and couldnt come with me and since i couldnt postpone it ive ended up being a sort of reluctant thoreau my name is mark randolph
2641394 it must be simply marvelous working in a big important office and taking down what important people say would you like me to be your secretary mr randolph
2641395 my wife was my secretary once before the war thats how we happened to meet
2641396 the very best i was sorry to lose her but then when i lost her in one sense i gained her in another so i guess you could hardly call that losing her
2641397 no i guess you couldnt well i must be getting back now mr randolph dad will be wanting to hear about all the things i saw and ive got to fix his supper
2641398 probably ive been coming here every day good bye now mr randolph
2641399 and when he lights it he cups his hands the same way you do even when there isnt any wind you and he are alike in lots of ways

2641401 with a time machine at your disposal you can move here any time you like
2641402 its not quite that easy even aside from the fact that i wouldnt dream of deserting my father theres the time police to take into consideration you see time travel is limited to the members of government sponsored historical expeditions and is out of bounds to the general public
2641403 thats because my father invented his own machine and the time police dont know about it
2641404 but only in their eyes only in the light of their concept of time my father has his own concept
2641405 but according to my fathers concept the book of time has already been written from a macrocosmic viewpoint my father says everything that is going to happen has already happened therefore if a person from the future participates in a past event he becomes a part of that event for the simple reason that he was a part of it in the first place and a paradox cannot possibly arise
2641406 you wouldnt believe all the books hes read mr randolph why our apartment is bursting with them hegel and kant and hume einstein and newton and weizs cker even read some of them myself
2641407 i gathered as much as a matter of fact so have i
2641408 he must have known it ever since the strontium 90 experiment he conducted at the laboratory but he never told anyone he never even told me i dont want to live without him theres nothing left to live for nothing nothing nothing
2641409 youll find something julie someone youre young yet youre still a child really
2641410 im not a child dont you dare call me a child

2641412 they have parts that need to be replaced and i dont know how to replace them ours mine may be good for one more trip but im not sure
2641413 in case i dont make it and for the record i love you
2641414 is is there a family by the name of danvers living anywhere around here

2641417 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established

2641422 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2641423 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2641424 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2641425 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence

2641447 theyre really inside earths atmosphere in a layer called the mesosphere ranging from 50 to 85 km high
2641448 krakatoa may have seeded the mesosphere with dust in 1883 but that doesnt explain the clouds we see now
2641449 upwelling winds in the summertime carry water vapor from the moist lower atmosphere toward the mesosphere

2641526 even as it receives a billion pounds of free food from international donors sudan is growing and selling vast quantities of its own crops to other countries capitalizing on high global food prices at a time when millions of people in its war riddled region of darfur barely have enough to eat
2641527 here in the bone dry desert where desiccated donkey carcasses line the road huge green fields suddenly materialize
2641528 but how much of this bonanza is getting back to the hungry sudanese like the 2 5 million driven into camps in darfur and why is a country that exports so many of its own crops receiving more free food than anywhere else in the world
2641529 african countries that rely on donated food usually cannot produce enough on their own somalia ethiopia niger and zimbabwe are all recent examples of how war natural disasters or gross mismanagement can cut deep into food production pushing millions of people to the brink of starvation

2641561 to every toiling heavy laden sinner jesus says come to me and rest
2641562 there were times in practice when i was wondering if i made the right move
2641563 im two weeks behind as far as practice and im 38 years old so im a little behind there too
2641564 my arm feels fine its going to be sore ive been throwing but theres no substitute for game type situations
2641565 after a bad game i dont hit the streets too much
2641566 you can play great for six games in a row and have a bad game and theyll make it seem like its the end of the world
2641567 it was one of the all time worst practices ive ever seen
2641568 there were times in practice i was wondering if i made the right move
2641569 to be totally honest with you i didnt know the jets were 4 12 last year until i got up here
2641570 you wanted them to step up to the plate and they did
2641571 you wanted them to make the big splash and they did
2641572 id just like to beat the guy for a change
2641573 the knock on him was that his arm wasnt that strong so what i can throw it through a wall but i dont win every game i play in it doesnt matter hes very effective
2641574 hes a good player and were going to face a lot of good players and hes definitely got some insight into the things we do
2641575 theres going to be a lot of excitement and a lot of comparisons
2641576 favre is trying to learn everybodys name he is trying to figure out where the cafeteria is and the dorm rooms everybody will help him along with the process
2641577 being in the same system and the same place for so long you get used to a routine
2641578 i think were going to be fine because he already opened up the lines of communication
2641579 it was a great feeling to come out for practice today
2641580 at this point in training camp everyone is like man its hot out here but practice went by so fast today just because of the fans
2641581 why are you picking on a man when hes down its only a simple slump now leave the guy alone you bum
2641582 i was told a lot that the nfl is easier than college
2641583 so once we take that next step its not as hard
2641584 guys are big and fast but im big and fast too
2641585 he agrees we certainly dont want to break camp without him having gotten anything done here
2641586 because the time in new york before the sept 4 opener is short
2641587 he got the broadway sign hes on the paper every day it must be nice for him
2641588 now theyve got the expectations and therell probably be less media in our locker room thats better for us
2641589 in new york the giants have always been the team
2641590 i dont think thats going to change but its nice for the jets to get some good publicity it seems like things are positive now for them which is good
2641591 i didnt see no reason for him to retire besides playing the game 17 plus years he hadnt lost a step his arm his throws everything was the same
2641592 great quarterback i just dont know if that was a smooth idea im not saying hes going to do something bad because i dont really know what the jets got this year but i think he had a pretty good thing with the packers
2641593 people who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster
2641594 the world is paying close attention to the way in which beijing conducts the olympics as they begin
2641595 its relationship to the government in sudan including weapons sales to that government is a matter of legitimate concern to all who care about human rights and ending genocide
2641596 as presumptive presidential nominees john mccain and barack obama already have tremendous power to influence china and the international community to do more to help end the genocide in darfur
2641597 we are pleased that both candidates have spoken out now to put pressure on china to help bring peace to darfur waiting until january 2009 will be too late for countless victims of this humanitarian crisis
2641598 there would be no greater example of the olympic spirit at work than for beijing to use this moment as host of the games that represent world peace to insist that its close partners in the sudanese regime stop attacking their own unarmed citizens allow the full un peacekeeping force to enter darfur and engage in a just peace process
2641599 china has the power to do this beijing could stop sending arms to sudan and stop protecting sudan at the united nations
2641600 china is a permanent member of the u n security council and was acting president when the security council approved the unamid peacekeeping mission as such china has a special responsibility to ensure the full and rapid deployment of a fully equipped peacekeeping force in darfur moreover as current custodian of the universal values of peace and fraternity represented by the olympics china has a special duty to ensure that its actions are consistent with those values

2641605 i feel sad seeing the situation in the country the present situation is quite contrary to what we had imagined for the country while walking on the path shown by mahatma gandhi today we can see corruption everywhere
2641606 our country is great people follow different religions and there are all kinds of people so there is bound be some difference of opinion but on the whole our country is on the path of progress i am satisfied
2641607 we love india it is second time we have been back here we heard about the boat race it s so famous
2641608 you know ive just laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china

2641610 and i want to thank this beautiful choir for singing amazing grace and edelweiss
2641611 chinas embracing of kuanjie church is a misleading and deceptive ploy used by china to deceive the international community into believing the cpc communist party of china is no longer persecuting christians
2641612 nothing more than a series of government sanctioned house cells that have permission to meet outside of the government sanctioned building
2641613 these cells are led by pastors who have been trained and appointed by the government and who are required to obey all rules set by the government supervisory body

2641628 happy are those conscious of their spiritual need since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them
2641629 happy are those who mourn since they will be comforted
2641630 happy are the mild tempered ones since they will inherit the earth
2641631 happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness since they will be filled
2641632 happy are the merciful since they will be shown mercy
2641633 happy are the pure in heart since they will see god
2641634 happy are the peaceable since they will be called sons of god
2641635 happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them
2641636 happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake 12 rejoice and leap for joy since your reward is great in the heavens for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you

2641640 this responsibility entrusted to local episcopal conferences has never been implemented
2641641 my questions are simply these where is the institute for the sacred arts in the united states why havent the bishops established this particular institute for the united states why do the american bishops frequently use artisans not from the united states when commissioning liturgical art
2641642 as a catholic who believes the expression of our religious faith deserves the highest caliber of materials and environments it confuses me why we continue to utilize religious goods suppliers to furnish our sacred spaces
2641643 why do we insist on using catalogue pieces that are pre made in a workshop usually in europe and do not exhibit any sense of originality or quality from their inception
2641644 most clergy with whom i am familiar do not know the difference between baroque and bauhaus but they insist on making the decisions about church design and architecture
2641645 such an understanding does not imply that the most expensive representations of religious expression constitute the highest quality of the artistic endeavor
2641646 clearly the intentions of the second vatican council regarding art and artistic expression within the church were intended to launch a renaissance of craftsmanship in our contemporary church unfortunately in most cases this rebirth and new appreciation of artisans and their crafts have only been experienced on a limited basis that is exactly why the united states bishops need to establish an institute that promotes and fosters an appreciation of all of these artistic disciplines

2641802 one it reminds me how lucky i am to do the job i do for instance a whole bunch of folks will be at bristol motor speedway in a couple of weeks but few of them will get the chance to experience the event up close as a journalist does that is a privilege and i never take it for granted too i try to write every story and put out every section with sports fans in mind thats because im a sports fan too and i want the herald courier to publish the kinds of stories that i want to read but i also want to write and publish stories that appeal to a broader reader ship one that appreciates a good story because its a good story
2641803 i want the herald courier to cover local sports as they have never been covered before
2641804 i want our section to be informative and to tell compelling stories i want our readers to check out the sports section every day because they want to find out what were up to and because well sprinkle in some surprises along the way
2641805 i bring a lot of years and experiences as a sports journalist to bristol
2641806 why come here because i have the chance to work with a quality sports staff its one with ability and potential maybe even more important the staff shares my passion for good journalism they want a great sports section so do i i could not be more excited about getting started
2641807 this is a young writer whose writing really belies his years you made a great call hiring him

2641819 i thought well my buddies in the vw boys and i could put on a show and raise some money
2641820 my modus operandi is that i will get there about an hour before the show and mingle
2641821 ive got some pictures that ill sign and i can also evaluate the audience by the time im on stage im pretty familiar with the audience ill pick people out of the crowd and call them goober or opie or aunt bee
2641822 im not trying to be don knotts im bringing mayberry into the show
2641823 i start in character then slide into a bit of andy then ill do goober or a little bit of floyd the barber
2641824 ill step out of character and speak from my heart about this good cause
2641825 i can share with them what a joy this is to me it is not a questionable difference its a clear difference you are making in someones life
2641826 my wife is on oxygen 24 seven my wheelchair has poked holes in the walls because the hallway is so narrow
2641827 my wife and i have been married for 32 years this will be our first home well get to say we have a home and its ours
2641828 our families put in a real investment and they pay back the mortgage its not a giveaway
2641829 the first qualification is that they are in inadequate housing
2641830 the second is their income and the third is their willingness to put in 500 hours of sweat equity
2641831 ive put in 385 hours so far i helped put trestles on i helped do the floors and helped put the walls up the site supervisor taught me how to use a nail gun
2641832 we have quite a few families that are on disability and they cant do the sweat equity
2641833 you dont have to swing a hammer but there are other ways they can serve
2641834 i have good upper body strength so i hammered nails and helped to hook up the receptacles
2641835 i helped to paint the kitchen dining area and laundry room a couple of weeks ago we stained the front porch and ramp
2641836 i told them i want to continue with the program and donate my time after my house is built
2641837 i want to help other people its brought me closer to my faith in god its an awesome program
2641838 you can prepare food for the workers there are leadership opportunities you dont have to be a carpenter to help
2641839 you cant imagine how uplifting it is to hand someone their keys
2641840 i get rather passionate about it its what our christian religion is all about helping people who are in need
2641841 i was working on hill street the millers house and saw some of the workers sweat profusely
2641842 and to me it was their heart going into the house
2641843 the only time to eat diet food is while youre waiting for the steak to cook

2641846 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2641847 would rather lose a war than lose a political campaign
2641848 we wanted to show that obama is vacuous the way these celebrities are
2641849 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
2641850 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
2641851 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
2641852 the majority of the american people tend to trust the republican party more on issues involving national security and defense than they do the democratic party
2641853 we need to work to improve our image on that score by taking a more aggressive posture with regard to iraq empowering the president
2641854 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2641855 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2641856 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2641857 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2641858 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2641859 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2641860 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2641861 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2641862 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2641863 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2641864 and ill see you a baby of drying clay so dont you cry
2641865 bravitzlana rubakalva our very own country bravitzlana rubakalva oh there we have see through bellies where we can watch all the miracles happening and we can watch our organs clapping and we can watch our bread dissolving and we can watch our cells dividing and we can see our babies floating and we can watch them form from nothing sit back and just watch them form from nothing
2641866 i represent landscape through several degrees of mediation first by building modest micro sculptures then through painting using themes of failed geometry failed architecture and failed illusionism this removal from the real reflects what i find to be a prevalent contemporary anxiety toward not only so called nature but also toward the real itself
2641867 its a pretty difficult offense to learn itll take some time but i think well be fine
2641868 the wind was up all day and the greens were firm and there were an awful lot of really tight pin placements that made it really tough to get it close and there were not any easy birdies out there
2641869 you never want to end your round with a three putt or any bogey
2641870 that hole is so tough that a par always feels like birdie
2641871 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2641872 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2641873 this isnt the ryder cup week we have three weeks to go i want a guy who is confident and if the guys confidence is shattered when he left here join the club

2641875 so i was warming it up and then id go practice then re warming it up and then going to practice again and i was eating and watching the olympics and talking and taking a nap i just kind of covered all the bases
2641876 i bet this guy runs for president one day and i bet he has a good chance reminds me a lot of bill clinton
2641877 it certainly speaks to the growing negative perceptions of the us here in latin america
2641878 as you grow older you tend to try to calm down a little bit more and realize what you have to do that its going to help you be the best player you can be out there
2641879 obviously its a tough major and we know that we are not used to seeing this kind of major on a pga championship but its still a major so you just got to realize it and just keep playing hard and hopefully you will be there on sunday
2641880 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2641881 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2641882 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2641883 paula zahns attack on the council on american islamic relations
2641884 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2641885 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2641886 does chanukah really have to jump on the commercialism bandwagon
2641887 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2641888 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2641889 we watched him come up to vladdy and shake vladdys hand and introduce himself
2641890 it was like ok hes open and confident hes not going to sit on the sidelines or separate himself from us then we saw how he was in games hes sitting next to me and were talking about pitchers and tendencies its like ok this guy is a baseball player all business loves the game this guy is perfect for this team
2641891 look as much as the power he brings its the discipline thats just as impressive
2641892 hes not going to swing at something he doesnt like hes going to be patient for our team for the fans its an approach that is great to watch
2641893 im a human being i have feelings im very comfortable here but i understand thats not my decision

2641899 i express my full satisfaction and i thank both the presidency undersecretary gianni letta and prime minister silvio berlusconi for the interest which they showed
2641900 i must thank personally the libyan ambassador in rome abdul hafed gaddur who gave proof of his great love for sicily and to have the trust of the libyan leader the libyan ambassador surprising us on the times and fulfilling our best hopes announced that the incident ended positively i invited him to palermo for an institutional visit i think that i can affirm that this is a demonstration of the esteem and friendship which renews and strengthens the ancient bond of solidarity among the peoples of the mediterranean and in particular between italy and libya
2641901 in many cases this kind of attitude leads to violence which ends with the beating up of copts or even the killing of many of them out in the open publics
2641902 a man he says can sign a wedding contract with a one year old girl not to speak of a nine seven or eight year old one
2641903 there are different religious opinions on the matter and for this reason it is necessary that the government issues a law
2641904 islam says that both parties must express their consent to the marriage contract
2641905 force her to marry somebody whom she does not want
2641906 we are really sorry for what happened we put a lot of effort towards their release and i wish to thank everyone who helped
2641907 if any pirate is caught now he will be jailed for 20 years or executed
2641908 they open cases against us there and then pass the paperwork on to moscow investigators

2641911 the united states olympic committee has learned of an incident that occurred earlier today involving two family members of a coach for the united states olympic mens indoor volleyball team
2641912 two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2641913 made some people misunderstand the communist partys leadership and distorted the social economic development policy
2641914 gratefulness to the military navy for this new proof of responsibility in the rescue of human lives
2641915 a request to create one has never been handed over and since there is no provision for such place of cult in the municipal urban instruments a decision by the town council is needed
2641916 religion has nothing to do with the case the provision would have been adopted even if this was a bar a restaurant a shop or a gym there is an unauthorised change in the purpose of the property and the lack of building and hygienic standards envisaged in such cases what is surprising however is that the practise was started in the municipal offices already back in 2004 obviously for the previous administration the law was not equal for everyone
2641917 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2641918 si on tait aussi beaux on serait c l bres
2641919 the economy is decelerating sharply the correction in the construction sector is still ongoing and the outlook for the near to medium term is rather bleak

2641922 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
2641923 the almost recession is having an impact i suppose people are going out less than before

2641928 it was the first time in a state election where race could have been a factor and wasnt
2641929 she fit the demographic perfectly she was active in the churches the majority of voters are female and she got blown out
2641930 i think its special that it happened in memphis because this is where dr king died
2641931 whites have voted for blacks and blacks have voted for whites in this state but never like this before in the past the only thing that brought us together like this was university of memphis tigers basketball barbecues and music
2641932 if youre a good representative if you put forth substantive legislation people will support you

2641940 como est n las cosas hoy en venezuela no tenemos un proceso electoral que garantice el respeto a la voluntad popular
2641941 es obvia la carencia de transparencia confiabilidad y eficiencia del m todo aplicado por smartmatic porque no expresan de forma di fana lo aspirado por el pueblo venezolano dada la fragilidad del ejercicio escrutador de sus m quinas
2641942 a la fecha la lista de electores que aparece en el cne con m s de 100 a os sigue con m s de 44 000 electores desconocemos cu ntos fallecidos doble y triple cedulados personas con mismo nombre y fecha de nacimiento electores sin direcciones completas han sido eliminados del registro electoral ni cuantos nuevos electores y migraciones han ocurrido recientemente tampoco se ha dado informaci n detallada por estado municipios y parroquias sobre extranjeros que podr n participar en las elecciones regionales ni los listados de reclamos atendidos y pendientes en cada caso

2641948 the first phase was does the township ordinance meet the constitutional requirement announced by the new jersey supreme court
2641949 this immunity is very significant what developers are doing is putting as much pressure on municipalities as they can to get their market units in place by threatening to put in affordable housing units
2641950 as a body the middletown human rights commission is of the opinion that mr gallaghers comments on his personal blog on july 17 2008 were highly offensive and inappropriate the middletown human rights commission works to encourage people to respect and tolerate one another
2641951 every variety and option the state allows for affordable housing the township has utilized
2641952 what i suggested in the memo was maybe what we the township committee need to do is possibly form a subcommittee
2641953 i just thought it would give us the township an opportunity to take an analytical look at the status of the human rights commission
2641954 invite you all the committee members into the conversation and to take it to the next level
2641955 john mccain may be bringing up race because his age and health are issues
2641956 i think at this present day americans are accepting of anything that doesnt affect them on an individual scale
2641957 i think americans would be accepting of a black president
2641958 it matters whether or not they would accept and support someone who is fighting to help america
2641959 i think race is silent but highly concentrated on every level depending on the community
2641960 try living in the south and go to the rural areas
2641961 ive heard it used in derogatory means and also as a term of endearment
2641962 just like any other word in the english dictionary the meaning of it can vary based on who and how it is used
2641963 to me it the n word replays the past battles that african americans have fought it takes society back hundreds of years
2641964 if we do that we might as well pull out all stops and reintroduce plantations lynchings and slave auctions
2641965 since when has the government been the forefront of cultural change especially involving vernacular
2641966 i dont feel that there is any way to turn a negative word into a word that holds any sort of positive meaning
2641967 while a neighborhood may be diverse smaller parts of it are not
2641968 but each individual needs to account for the role they play in perpetuating the disgusting habit that is racism
2641969 it seems like we are getting the wrong idea of exactly what that study would be if you read what it actually is unfortunately it doesnt go along with our project
2641970 loss of or impacts to businesses from noise or nuisance are not addressed in an economic impact study or categorical exclusion document
2641971 it seems unfortunate that there isnt something the dot performs in this situation
2641972 we need this information to protect our businesses and take proactive measures
2641973 our budget doesnt allow us to have certain liberties that other boroughs may have
2641974 how do they expect us to have the funding to do certain things when the budget is what it is
2641975 this is a tourist area and we need substantial signage and we dont have it
2641976 there is no clear signage directing visitors who dont live here and dont know where to go

2642000 since this is pending litigation we are unable to comment
2642001 i went online to find out what to do and what bus to take
2642002 the bus driver was very helpful and so were the other passengers
2642003 i enjoyed it it was just getting over that initial scariness
2642004 i got tired of figuring out where to park and walking from there to work there was no designated parking for us and if i wanted to park close to my office i had to pay quite a bit of money i found out the jo had a route that went right in front of my office
2642005 i like meeting all the people who ride the bus and ive developed friendships the neat part is the variety of people you meet on the bus we have people who bike to the oak park mall and then ride downtown its a good fraternity and sorority on the bus
2642006 you might have a new driver the weather might be bad or there might be a lot of people riding give it a couple days
2642007 i dont miss driving to work every once in while i drive in just to break the routine or if i want to stay late but i enjoy riding the bus
2642008 i wasnt familiar with the northland area i also rode the bus to save money
2642009 they become like family and you look forward to seeing them i know all the people on the bus and they know me

2642049 clearly there was anxiety about what sort of model we should have to move towards a republic
2642050 there will be a day in this nation im absolutely confident when we will be a republic
2642051 but labor is taking this in a measured way we understand that ultimately this is a matter that the community needs to settle a view on
2642052 im not a great fan of the word narrative but i can tell you very easily what this governments about she said
2642053 its about designing and implementing the long term plans that matter for this nations future
2642054 and foremost amongst them is making sure that weve got a productive and prosperous economy for the future
2642055 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment mr smith told the nine network
2642056 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2642057 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2642058 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty he said
2642059 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2642060 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty

2642064 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future
2642065 our first unit didnt play that long friday i dont know yet that we can all of a sudden be a pass heavy team and throw the ball all over the place
2642066 with a right tackle that was injured the last half of the year coming back a new left tackle and not very much line depth theres no part of me right now that could tell you we would be able to change right now from where we were last year
2642067 the physical characteristics and the meanings or what the symbols stand for
2642068 i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out
2642069 none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life but ten years later when we were designing the first macintosh computer it all came back to me
2642070 i didnt see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me
2642071 remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life
2642072 norms puts a restriction on people often when you do things out of the extraordinary people around you outkast you my mentality has always been if god wanted us to be all the same then why did he makes us so different
2642073 you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards
2642074 im pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadnt been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick dont lose faith im convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did
2642075 remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart

2642088 there are a lot of guys here today and i want to thank them for coming
2642089 i want to thank the giants for inviting all these great guys
2642090 its weird for me not to be in uniform with the dodgers right there you heard me torre i beat you before and i can beat you again i havent retired thank you
2642091 i know the players and coaches enjoy seeing those guys again
2642092 these players watched them and respected them it gives the guys a chance to go through memories about great times in san francisco
2642093 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
2642094 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
2642095 he threw the ball away which is one of those situations that we talked about
2642096 he made a couple nice throws there on some back shoulder throws
2642097 they told us at the beginning of training camp this going to be a tough competition
2642098 it just got tougher now we have to compete against four guys not three
2642099 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2642100 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defense we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish
2642101 weve got to do a little better job of getting the defense off the field right now
2642102 its the hardest ive ever seen him get hit that never happens it really doesnt
2642103 my job is pitching my job is to go to the mound and throw six seven eight innings but today i didnt do my job
2642104 i lost the count how many four well good for them
2642105 there is nothing you can do about it just move on and think of my next start
2642106 i really had no idea its one of those things
2642107 for me as long as im having good at bats and going up there not making bad outs im ok obviously at 0 for 29 it didnt turn around for a while i was able to get a couple in there and take advantage of a couple balls he left up
2642108 thats the hardest ive seen z get hit in the last two years ive been here i thought hed throw the ball better but it happens to anybody the cardinals are a good hitting team
2642109 we were aggressive and the wind was blowing out it was one of those weird days at wrigley
2642110 its finally good to get to a guy like that because hes very good
2642111 i loved playing here and i definitely wanted to come in here and give them a game

2642116 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2642117 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2642118 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2642119 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2642120 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2642121 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2642122 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2642123 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2642128 the assault on mercaz harav seminary and the more recent bulldozer attacks were appalling but israel shouldnt respond by trampling on basic rights
2642129 the house demolition measures would violate international law because they punish people who are not even accused let alone convicted of a crime
2642130 proposals to allow the israel defense forces to resume the collective punishment of house demolitions would mark a substantial step backward in israels respect for human rights a return to illegality
2642131 ambos candidatos en esta elecci n se comprometieron a terminar esta guerra y traer a los soldados a casa la gran diferencia es que yo pretendo ganar primero

2642134 its just a difficult time but in some cases its proved to be an opportunity to sit down and work things out
2642135 our primary interest was in getting a contract a contract we could defend and the community could accept
2642136 we analyzed our contract and we knew where we were spending dollars that we wanted to spend differently we told the teachers you have to help us find the money and to their credit they did
2642137 we went in with the mindset that there were significant fiscal restraints on the district and we educated our members about that
2642138 we told them to be mindful of the economic and political climate you know my teachers have the same bills as everyone else so they understand
2642139 we knew what the issues were before negotiations began because of all our meetings over the years and we were able to keep tally of the interests of the school committee as well as the teachers
2642140 there is a lot of familiarity with mary anne roll and mary ann mccomiskey
2642141 we respect each others opinion we want to come to common ground everyone agreed were here for the students
2642142 but it was an area we could cut that would not directly affect students
2642143 we wanted a thinner contract and we didnt get that
2642144 there is a lot of language that goes back 25 to 30 years and no one even knows where it came from anymore the public sometimes thinks we are negotiating a three year contract were not were renegotiating a 30 year contract and that doesnt happen all at once
2642145 there is a decreasing amount of funding that communities can seek under the states property tax cap
2642146 and by not appropriating the entire amount they can under law they are decreasing their ability to fund schools in the future
2642147 what lincoln shows is that both sides were willing in a tough financial environment to find a way to make sure that they reach an agreement so there is no work stoppage and programs continue and that teachers got what both sides thought was fair
2642148 districts have to get creative because both sides are realizing there is just not a lot of movement to be had on the money

2642151 haberse elevado tanto el rango de inflaci n implica el riesgo de generar una tendencia que m s tarde ser dif cil de romper y si llegamos al cierre del a o con un indicador de 6 0 por ciento ser muy dif cil ubicar las negociaciones salariales contractuales de enero por debajo de 5 0 por ciento lo cual influir negativamente en la inflaci n de 2009

2642153 el problema ahora es que rusia no s lo usar esta crisis para demostrar su poder o militar en la regi n sino tambi n para argumentar que es tiempo de redibujar el mapa
2642154 fue una ceremonia fabulosa me qued muy impresionado con la entrada y los tambores luego fue muy bonito tambi n lo de la paloma de la paz y el encendido del fuego fue muy original
2642155 deseo felicitarles a los organizadores de todo coraz n creo que todo el mundo est admirado de lo que ha logrado china
2642156 una buena organizaci n que ya est asegurada tras el xito de ayer y una participaci n buena del equipo local
2642157 yo me alegro mucho de los xitos de china porque me considero un viejo amigo de este pa s
2642158 todos los chinos pueden estar muy orgullosos ya que han conseguido organizar una ceremonia inaugural que ha visto todo el universo
2642159 nicos y los m s importantes que se han conseguido jam s
2642160 todo el mundo se ha dado cuenta de que este pa s va adelante es capaz de muchas cosas y lo importante tambi n para m es que los chinos cada vez viven mejor
2642161 esto coincide con la cultura milenaria de cer mica de china
2642162 hey ill just wash up these pants that smell like a dead body for casey my granddaughter has been missing for over a month and my daughter is in jail for maybe killing her this is the perfect time to wash these pants that were in the car that also smells like a dead body you know in case casey needs to wear them while shes in jail
2642163 the records were apparently sought as part of a terrorism investigation but the f b i did not explain what was being investigated or why the reporters phone records were considered relevant
2642164 the justice department places a high bar on the collection of reporters records in investigations because of first amendment concerns and obtaining such records requires the approval of the deputy attorney general
2642165 that requirement was not followed when the f b i obtained the records of two reporters for the times in indonesia raymond bonner and jane perlez as well as two reporters there for the post ellen nakashima and natasha tampubolon officials said

2642169 science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn ones living at it
2642170 id worry about it every time you face a team that has six kind of elite pass rushers on the same team or at least five four of which are defensive ends
2642171 the giants were very unique i think what people had selective amnesia about was they knocked tom down 20 something times in the last regular season game in the season cw0
2642172 the giants were real quick to remind people they hit this guy before during super bowl week they kept saying weve hit him weve knocked him down weve done a lot of stuff to him so was that just one game the super bowl no i dont think so
2642173 they led the league in the fewest amount of sacks last season
2642174 you look what they drafted what they signed and what theyre doing there wasnt a whole lot of eternal internal panic about what happened
2642175 its basically about opportunities you only get a certain number before the preseason ends to show what you can do
2642176 you try to take advantage of all of them try not to make mistakes and just try to do what the coaches ask you to do
2642177 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family
2642178 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
2642179 based on a preliminary investigation theres a number of unresolved issues because of the unresolved issues the officer is remaining on duty
2642180 it was tough the defense is usually ahead of the offense at this point but were really close
2642181 we ran a lot of plays that were right there but there was just one little thing that went wrong one guy didnt get the block routes were a little bit short throws were a little off but i think were really close and were right where we need to be
2642182 there were some really good things and some things that need some improvement
2642183 weve had six practices and you can see weve made some improvement since spring ball and weve just got to continue to get better well take a look at this film make some adjustments and some personnel moves
2642184 i think it was his first go around and there was some sloppiness from every area but well get better well get it fixed
2642185 the fans will love hearing that name chanted in here wont they hes a good football player
2642186 all in all i think this was a good start for me
2642187 once i got popped real good i was like this is what ive been waiting for
2642188 ive always wanted to come to a winning organization and get back to playing football comfortably and where i have a chance to contribute
2642189 im not even thinking about oakland i put patriots gear on now and i have to show this organization i can help this team get back to where it needs to be
2642190 its been different because i feel like a rookie again almost
2642191 im out there with the special teams and when we have opportunity period at the end of workouts and its only just rookies im out there with them doing extra opportunity work
2642192 today i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2642193 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2642194 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2642195 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2642196 that seems like so long ago it seems like a dream
2642197 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down that i know every guy in the locker room or they know me
2642198 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2642199 i was really surprised that today i was as effective as i was and im not saying that that was good
2642200 im just saying i was able to take a snap call a play we were able to break a huddle and i was able to complete passes in some sort of rhythm
2642201 all the rumors about him throwing hard yeah theyre true
2642202 as soon as we stepped out here the stands are filled and it creates a new energy for the team
2642203 blindsided why the left tackle is overrated and other contrarian football thoughts
2642204 its fair to say i wouldnt be here had it not been for those abstracts
2642205 i knew at about age 8 that i wanted to do something in football but it wasnt until i read bills 1984 abstract that i said to myself this is my lifes goal i also would say his writing had an immense impact on the way i see the world im not really much of a baseball fan anymore football is an all the time thing in my house but ill read any and everything james writes because of his unique way of looking at the world
2642206 it also soon became clear that certain underachieving players were losing games for their teams as much as the overachieving ones were winning them
2642207 that gave me a new perspective on tony dungys saying that 85 percent of games are lost rather than won had i heard this before the tape research i would have thought about fumbles interceptions and the like bad playing losing games for teams would have been on the list but not as high as mistake plays after the tape reviews i realized bad players were at least as responsible and probably more so than the mistake plays
2642208 thats a major part of why there isnt more analysis and why i wrote the prescription for change chapter that closes out blindsided
2642209 i think the most detailed raw data wont be there until there are full libraries of game tape footage prospective researchers can utilize to do analysis
2642210 having said that there are a number of analyses that can be done via standard play by play sheets the crew at football outsiders does a very good job of crunching numbers of that nature in their annual pro football prospectus books i tend to lean much more heavily on granular scouting methods such as types of route run and type of coverage played against it so it really does take a full breakdown of all 256 games to make each years scientific football possible
2642211 i really am fully confident hell be ready because of the way that he behaved when he came in last spring as a midterm guy he embraced that experience and hes just tough
2642212 running backs coach ben sirmans did a great job of teaching him what it is we want him to do in the offense man i never have seen a kid come in with that dramatic of an entrance before to where he just walked on the field and said lets go play he wasnt intimidated
2642213 he looks really small but he weighs 190 pounds and he brings a heavy hit and hes durable i was overly impressed with what i saw and hes continued that into summer and now into this fall camp id be really dumbfounded if what has been happening doesnt continue on
2642214 it just had to be the number of plays thrown at you that was the toughest part and the pass protection in high school protection wasnt that big of a deal as it is in college its been a new deal for me coach sirmans has been working on it with me a great deal and hes helping a lot
2642215 i think with my height ill be able to get under defenders and in practice were not able to cut the defenders which ill be able to do in the games and that will make me better at it
2642216 they give us a distinct possibility of an explosion play on the run
2642217 we didnt have much of that last year we just didnt l v whitworth and andre gave us more power but were geared right now to hand the ball off and get that surprise home run
2642218 its nice as an offensive lineman to know that if you create a little crease for him hell dart right through there and they might not be able to see him behind us with his size
2642219 sometimes you think things are going to be easy from the get go and theyre not
2642220 were playing against very good teams that have been together for a long time
2642221 i told him if the czechs came back and the u s lost this game id come and find him
2642222 it was awesome i know he had to leave early
2642223 its an honor that he came out and watched us perform and that he is a fan of womens basketball
2642224 just to come out here tonight and see how many fans were supporting us and that our president was out here was good
2642225 we knew the mens team was going to come today
2642226 they were saying all day were going to come were going to come
2642227 people speak of adrenaline and on a day like today you need every little bit of it and fenway came through for me
2642228 this more than fulfilled my expectations to look up and see the fans standing and cheering and then to come through it couldnt be any better
2642229 i wanted to come out and have a good start and show i can pitch in an atmosphere like this
2642230 i talked to him before that 12th inning at bat just to make sure hes breathing and relaxed
2642231 he gave me a big smile and said ive got this ill take care of it its great to see hes had a tough year but hes come on strong the last three or four weeks
2642232 i feel good here because ive been here before and i dont feel scared
2642233 i want to make it to the big leagues with boston and play with ortiz before he retires

2642244 i spoke to bernie most days over the past 36 years for my generation he was a direct link to show business in the 1950s and 60s in new york but beyond that he was just the best human being he loved talent and he loved show business yet what was most remarkable was the way bernie somehow kept his balance in a world where people do just awful things to each other he never gave up his heart he was one of the most decent and generous people ive ever known
2642245 he dont like liberals and he dont pull no punches
2642246 great name lively commentary great name good satire great name

2642249 it was wrong on my part to have clammed up on the issue it could have prevented the undue defamation of vice mayor polig and the good people of alfonso lista should have done this earlier
2642250 to set the record straight then let me be candid while socializing in the course of our interview we were drinking liquor at the same time and unknowingly i may have been insensitive to the culture and practices of our hosts i could have behaved like a true gentleman and public servant
2642251 what is important is that the firm violated no law we cannot say it enjoys an undue advantage because it is aboveboard
2642252 the important thing is that it will help the economy and our country
2642253 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2642254 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2642255 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2642256 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier

2642259 first of all i am not putting michael in that jumper thing hell look like a total dork
2642260 you see thats all permissible populist rhetoric that the corporations understand and wink at
2642261 obamas taking large money from the securities industry the health insurance industry
2642262 a charade his health insurance plan lets the health insurance companies continue their redundant wasteful often corrupt in terms of billing fraud ways ripping off medicare my vice presidential candidate matt gonzalez has written a 3 000 word tract on obama thats on our web site votenader org you should read it
2642263 but hes made up his mind to be a very conciliatory concessionary adaptive politician to the reality of corporate power and people like him are told look if you dont adhere to certain parameters and expectations youre going to have a hard time winning any nomination or election and obamas made his peace with that
2642264 so many people in chicago regaled him because he was for palestinian rights a two state solution now he wont say many things on behalf of the palestinians after a while you get an idea of his political character his political personality hes not a transforming leader he was not a transforming senator he was not a challenging senator the way the late paul wellstone was

2642276 i went to the toronto show last night and it was brilliant to see women and men empowered by their bodies and minds rather then being restrained by them was remarkable ive never been to an event like this before but ill be sure to be there next year thanks to those who organized the night and even more to those who shared their stories and lives
2642277 it was a major treat meeting you the other night you and the rest of the fam did a brilliant fabulous extra incredible performance that blew all of our minds here in philly and then some i left taking so much with me thank you for sharing your concerns passions dreams pursuits personal experiences and the like making a resounding statement to me that im not alone in a place where its easy to slide back into insular spaces
2642278 your show last night was so wonderful powerful intelligent thrilling sexy warm biting insightful
2642279 i hope you felt the love on saturday night at buddies
2642280 unlike any politician who had ever run for president in the history of the land

2642289 we think weve got some pretty good hitters and we think weve got some guys who are going to be good hitters in the future maybe they just dont possess the power that maybe some other clubs do possess but power its a funny thing it always seems to be the last thing to come if you dont just naturally possess that kind of strength i think eventually these guys will hit home runs maybe this is not the year
2642290 we cant seem to put a lot of offense together and at some point were going to have to
2642291 we cant rely on our pitching and defense to win us games all the time theyre beneficial and they help you win games but weve got to score some runs these games are too tight and its hard to play like that every night it just seems like everyones taken a little step backwards malec has taken a step backwards a little bit ajs stepped back a little bit colin has the three guys that had been doing some hitting arent swinging very well it happens like that from time to time but you hope it doesnt happen to four five or six guys in the lineup at the same time

2642298 i am deeply saddened italy loses a leading personality of the countrys industrial life and the representative of a dynasty that did so much for the made in italy brand around the world
2642299 italy turin and the fiat group have lost a business figure who knew how to follow and develop the work of his grandfather pinin and his father sergio
2642300 the market is now speculating about a potential sale of the company
2642301 but everythings all right i just got through talking to him hes fine he just wanted to stay in the game i like that theres nothing wrong with that as a matter of fact if he doesnt want to stay in the game id probably be mad
2642302 i felt like i could get the next guy out at least finish the inning off and then maybe have a decision to be made
2642303 sometimes your emotions get the best of you and you might do something irrational out there
2642304 its going to be a little weird seeing these guys in a couple of days
2642305 ramirez has been a real good piece but we got back a player that our scouts like a lot
2642306 orlando is supposed to be a legitimate center fielder obviously hes not ready for this level yet but youve got to continue to build baseball operations and our scouts jumped at this opportunity
2642307 they are being exposed to sex and to talk about sex before theyre even old enough to even think about having sex
2642308 young people who watch a lot of sexual content on television have distorted attitudes about sexuality that it must be that everybodys whos not married is going around having sex all the time and having kinky sex in all kinds of strange situations
2642309 the rise of sexually transmitted diseases and the increase in out of wedlock pregnancies and births
2642310 im not sure i accept the premise that negative effects arent happening
2642311 it has been going down and the rate s of out of wedlock births and of teen births have been going down but until they go down to zero we have to keep trying to promote these positive values in our culture
2642312 the truth is children think about sex whether we want them to or not
2642313 i think it makes some people feel good because they say aha theres the enemy and if only we could do something about that everything would be better
2642314 its not that the muffled majesty of authorship doesnt here ostensibly reign but i catch myself again shaking it off and disavowing the pretence of it while i get down into the arena and do my best to live and breathe and rub shoulders and converse with the persons engaged in the struggle that provides for the others in the circling tiers the entertainment of the great game
2642315 that we humans are a choice making species that at this defining moment face both the opportunity and the imperative to choose our future as a conscious collective act

2642322 its an amazing encouragement when we share these stories of chinese christians from country to country when they believers realize there is someone else who stood up for christ it encourages them and they can stand too
2642323 what the hell for youre giving money to a guy who looks at all of us with contempt and has no respect for any of us
2642324 and where was all this concern for me when my step brother was killed in a bike wreck my family had to see it as the lead story on the tv news and read about it on the front page of the paper in my home town
2642325 and when my brother died in africa after getting bit by something you motherfuckers couldnt even pass around a card much less donate to me and i dont look down on you like this guy does so what the fuck is up with all of this bullshit fuck the whole lot of you
2642326 the first shall be last and the last shall be first
2642327 for awhile everyone was saying this is a temporary blip a change because of dissatisfaction with the iraq war but its more permanent
2642328 it looks like for every republican turning out to the polls there will be a democrat turning out to the polls
2642329 it doesnt mean republicans cant win elections it just means they have to work hard that safety margin is gone
2642330 we think we have just about turned the corner in new hampshire and become the dominant political party thanks to candidates at the national level but also candidates here like john lynch and jeanne shaheen
2642331 were spending 14 to 16 hours a day identifying voters were absolutely not taking anything for granted
2642332 one of the lessons i learned from 2006 is that there is no such thing as a safe seat anymore
2642333 theres this arc in news coverage about new hampshire becoming a competitive state but its always been competitive the tide is always moving
2642334 basically democrats and republican are at parity in new hampshire now
2642335 but i dont think it is a problem that needs to be solved with just more staff
2642336 it is one of the things that i am working with the police chief to change
2642337 somebody should come to a conclusion on some of these
2642338 what is really important is the issue of health and safety
2642339 its certainly not something we condone this process has been great that incident aside ive met a lot of good volunteers its been a very positive experience as a whole
2642340 these little guys here were the first ones that i had ever seen
2642341 i was just shocked and horrified that bedbugs were here in nashua and real you know
2642342 you hear about these things in obscure tropical places in the world but not in nashua new hampshire
2642343 odor complaints are probably the worst ones we deal with because you just dont know if it is going to be somebody who is hypersensitive or oh my god here we go again
2642344 the floor in the house was completely covered with animal feces which has obviously been accumulating for some time creating unbearable odor
2642345 as an officer i have several concerns with this situation to start with the occupant appears to need some everyday assistance her appearance also showed her state of mind for she had animal feces on her person
2642346 i have to make sure that people are extremely sensitive and know who to contact
2642347 the thing that is interesting about hoarding is that it is so closely associated with obsessive compulsive disorder
2642348 you can lay down the law and say this has to be done by this time set some goals and you go back and nothing is done because they cant part with it
2642349 this was a woman who worked in the community presented as normal to everyone around her and was living in trash knee deep chicken bones cat waste the whole bit
2642350 in good conscience i cannot put a little old lady with too many dogs who just cant even be in a house by herself on the street i just cant do it
2642351 it was a few select apartments and then all of a sudden we were just inundated
2642352 we tell them their mattress is infested and then over the weekend they drag it down the hallway and take it down the elevator so the next thing i know i have got bugs throughout the building and i am spraying hallways and six floors it is a sideshow
2642353 a lot of people try to resolve issues on their own which isnt necessarily safe
2642354 i will typically explain this is in your interest to do this because if you wont be treating this apartment you will be treating the next one soon enough because these little guys are hungry
2642355 they are looking for a blood meal and they travel real well
2642356 it annoys me to no end when a pest control company gets a big contract for a multi unit building and they dont do an inspection of the whole building
2642357 there was human feces filling the toilet and no water in either the bowl or the tank
2642358 there were holes throughout the walls which caused the wastewater to leak down into a lower apartment

2642371 more development around the lake will come in time and if were not proactive in managing the natural resources of the land forest and water and providing for the folks that live here this place will change in a way that most people dont want to see i think
2642372 there was need to understand whether people felt a connection to newfound lake and to the watershed and whether they would help support rules and regulations that would help guide everyone more appropriately
2642373 as i said in my closing arguments this was no office pool he was taking money from veterans
2642374 i came back from maine and said what are you talking about
2642375 youre going to let these people hang because you dont have the guts to step up to the plate
2642376 you have to step up to the plate and do the right thing
2642377 i could have stayed in maine and they would have indicted two other people

2642379 football memorabilia has increased in popularity over the past several years game used football jerseys of ones favorite player is usually on the top of each collectors want list
2642380 since your items were only used in a practice scrimmage situation the value would be much less than that of a game used item your field jackets from the mid to late 1970s are worth 75 each a nice keepsake for any falcons fan
2642381 most challenging year to date with regard to efforts at the state level to restrict directory publishers ability to freely deliver phone books
2642382 the ones that get used will remain and the ones that dont will go away
2642383 the internet is the sexy new technology out there but it isnt where most of their money is coming from its coming from the mom and pop stores that want to be in that yellow pages book

2642386 for some chinese companies you could argue they need only five to 15 years to develop a global brand
2642387 perhaps consumers all over the world will think china is all low end but we want to be the high end
2642388 to change that view is very difficult but we have no choice
2642389 we want to do the europe market last year and this year

2642391 i drove a cab in detroit but watkins glen worried me a lot more
2642392 a lot of these guys have no clue what theyre doing out there especially when they see a right turn
2642393 nascar drivers throughout the last couple years im going to go back even as far as 10 years theyve started to put a lot of effort into their road racing because its two of the 36 races
2642394 and if you run the nationwide car as well it could be four
2642395 so theres a lot of good road racers i mean mark martin has been a phenomenal road racer for as long as i can remember i teamed up with him in the late 80s we won the 24 hours of daytona together look at whats happened the last eight years in cup races its been a nascar regular thats won all these races
2642396 the biggest thing on the oval is you know back off early get it into the corner then get back on the gas
2642397 its similar to how i run the road races as well i try to roll the middle as fast as i can and i think you know thats helped me on the road courses
2642398 but you know the short ovals i normally run pretty good at so it seems like that works there too
2642399 its no secret that i really dont like road courses
2642400 watkins glen is a little faster and flatter than infineon raceway but i grew up watching racing on ovals and not road courses
2642401 ive had a good run or two at the glen and im running the nationwide race there saturday to get some extra seat time but i just generally dont like road course racing we just want to run well get through it and get on with oval track racing next week at michigan
2642402 even though ive had my share of ups and downs at the glen i still consider it my home track
2642403 i like everything about it the track the area the people the restaurants the saidhead fan club and seneca lodge
2642404 i had the fastest car that day and i know i could have won the race
2642405 but i got punted from behind by robby spun out and hit the fence that one is still hard to swallow
2642406 that stuff happens all the time all the time because thats in the heat of the moment its competitive theres sweat running down your forehead this is a decision making business that you have to do now not always are you going to make the right decisions and you never know what the right decision is until the whole thing unfolds
2642407 talent does what it can genius does what it must
2642408 at age 18 the girls who had regular meals with their family defined for the study as five or more a week had a much lower risk of substance abuse and the meal didnt have to be dinner eisenberg said a previous analysis of the same study participants found a stronger association for girls than boys between family meals and a lower risk of eating disorders yet to come is an analysis of the effect family meals have on a teens mental health

2642415 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2642416 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down

2642429 the egyptian government imposed a new measure which increases the extent of censorship on internet users and violates their right to privacy
2642430 their names email and phone numbers before they use the internet
2642431 this severely abusive procedure proves that the security policies aim to impose constraints and censorship on internet users
2642432 its just another spin on the same old thing again
2642433 its just another spin on the same old thing again
2642434 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2642435 its just another spin on the same old thing again
2642436 i was the hall monitor it was my job to look after my classmates

2642447 hey i used to be the school nerdette young and hideous i even had the retainer and thick glasses and as soon as i started making money i paid enough treatments to leave me looking decent enough you work up from there could be the same thing for artie
2642448 when i was going to meet with my old school friends i was in a crash diet for months i was the young and hideous in my days so nothing but water and laxatives i dressed in black i looked great i kicked ass
2642449 of course i fainted after the appetizers stomach couldnt handle food but i looked great i havent been able to fit into that black dress ever again

2642452 i once met with my high school nerd he was hot and single and loaded with cash

2642457 maybe its all your angry residue ever since you got dumped youve been a less hotter version of carrie brawdshaw

2642470 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2642471 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2642472 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2642473 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines

2642478 well mom our teacher told us how god sent moses behind enemy lines on a rescue mission to lead the israelites out of egypt when he got to the red sea he had his army build a pontoon bridge and all the people walked across safely then he radioed headquarters for reinforcements they sent bombers to blow up the bridge and all the israelites were saved
2642479 now joey is that really what your teacher taught you
2642480 well no mom but if i told it the way the teacher did youd never believe it
2642481 some woodcock will breed in pennsylvania and stay through the summer
2642482 more probably will use it as a stopover place to rest and forage
2642483 were taking what was basically a rest stop for woodcock and turning it into a five star resort for woodcock and grouse
2642484 if the habitat we develop is suitable and attractive the birds will use it to mate nest and forage within three to five years we should see a young but well established scrub shrub area we anticipate the species surviving well and reproducing
2642485 we have measured the woodcock decline and know its significant
2642486 we dont have tracking mechanisms for grouse as we do for woodcock but we know grouse habitat has declined tremendously
2642487 research shows that hunting makes little difference its about the same as predation by hawks
2642488 sure well run our dogs down there and we might hunt a little but its not about what we put in the bag
2642489 its about improving habitat for all wildlife including songbirds its about regenerating the life cycle for many different species

2642512 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2642513 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2642514 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2642515 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2642516 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2642517 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2642518 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2642519 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2642520 we have to take it one small step at a time
2642521 we dont want to appear to be too far out there
2642522 you know how tradespeople are most of them dont own computers you cant expect them to understand how to properly document a job

2642527 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2642528 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly
2642529 weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us
2642530 we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2642531 wed be gutted to lose here but we do have an opportunity to win
2642532 england looked vibrant and i do think our guys werent mentally in the same space as they were at the start of the series and thats understandable but its even stevens now with another one or two partnerships we can get up to or over 200 220 and put a lot of pressure on the england top five we feel we can defend that
2642533 hes improved over the last 12 months before he came here and what wed seen of him from when we did our homework hes become a much tighter player than last time he played against england
2642534 he got a beautiful ball from steve harmison to get rid of him in the first innings but what hes done so well is hes latched onto anything slightly loose and put it away for four he hits down the ground now as well as square so hes a pretty accomplished player
2642535 he obviously had a problem when he started but when i came in as coach he was always the one we identified to bat at 3 for us
2642536 we needed to give him a run and an opportunity
2642537 when we look back to where the planning started for a tour like this two years ago we needed hash to come into the tour with 20 tests under his belt hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him and hes going to be a quality player
2642538 hes so calm hes got a good head and hes pretty streetwise for a player his age
2642539 timmy has damaged a finger which is quite nasty actually but as all true keepers do he got stuck in and hes carrying on but its quite painful
2642540 it might be broken we dont know but in some ways theres not much point in doing much about it now because the games on so its one of those where well assess it at the end of the game
2642541 hes happy to carry on the doctors seen it and doesnt think he has done any structural damage so hell carry on with painkillers and well sort it out afterwards
2642542 he did brilliantly because it was definitely no more than a half or a third chance
2642543 he got a hand on it but if you watch the footage back hes got an awfully long way to get there
2642544 inside edges are especially difficult for keepers because youre setting yourself for the outside edge all the time
2642545 id give him credit for getting a hand to it actually i wouldnt have got anywhere near it dont worry about that
2642546 timmy handles things really well hes a very level headed bloke
2642547 whether hes done well by getting 100 at wellington or had tougher times he stays very much at an even keel which is very much a strength of his
2642548 he makes some difficult things look very easy when the ball wobbles and moves around so i think hes handled himself very well
2642549 its a pressure environment we know that and he knows that and hes desperate to get a score in the second innings
2642550 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2642551 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2642552 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out
2642553 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2642554 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2642555 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out
2642556 we knew we would have to bat well in the second innings
2642557 i think its even stevens now theres still a lot of hard work to do
2642558 the guys will be fighting to win because i still think we have the opportunity to win this test
2642559 all the things wed done so well in the last 18 months we forgot
2642560 hes got big boots to fill but hes certainly started the right way
2642561 hes so calm and hes got such a good head and hes pretty streetwise for his age
2642562 theres still a lot of cricket to play but we are in a good position
2642563 we are still ahead and they are two wickets down it will be important to come back early tomorrow and put them under pressure
2642564 they looked vibrant i knew they would come out with a point to prove they hit us hard on day one and kevin played really well in his first test as captain
2642565 from what we have seen so far england look pretty handy but they have always been handy theyre a very good cricket team
2642566 but from a south african point of view we certainly dont want to lose any test matches
2642567 we would be really gutted to lose the last test match here
2642568 as long as we remember the things that have got us to this point we will be fine going forward and we will keep improving
2642569 the guys are going to be fighting to win this one because we still have the opportunity to do so
2642570 we feel we can defend 220 and if we can get that high there will be a lot of pressure on the england top five
2642571 i dont want to make excuses because it was a pretty ordinary performance
2642572 the thing that i kept reminding the guys about and what i have been reminding them in the second innings is we forgot all the things we have been doing well over the past 18 months
2642573 that comes down to relaxing slightly mentally we werent as tight or as decisive in our movements or as patient as weve been
2642574 mentally the guys werent in the same space as they were at the start of the series
2642575 he had a problem when he started but when i came in he was a guy we identified to bat at three for us
2642576 he was the one we went for in that role we needed to run with him and give him an opportunity
2642577 he has blossomed repaid the faith we showed in him and he will be a quality player going forward
2642578 he is so calm with such a good head someone who is pretty streetwise in cricket terms for his age
2642579 timmy has damaged a finger which is quite nasty actually but as all true keepers do he got stuck in and hes carrying on but its quite painful
2642580 it might be broken we dont know but in some ways theres not much point in doing much about it now because the games on so its one of those where well assess it at the end of the game
2642581 hes happy to carry on the doctors seen it and doesnt think he has done any structural damage so hell carry on with painkillers and well sort it out afterwards
2642582 he did brilliantly because it was definitely no more than a half or a third chance
2642583 he got a hand on it but if you watch the footage back hes got an awfully long way to get there
2642584 inside edges are especially difficult for keepers because youre setting yourself for the outside edge all the time
2642585 id give him credit for getting a hand to it actually i wouldnt have got anywhere near it dont worry about that
2642586 timmy handles things really well hes a very level headed bloke
2642587 whether hes done well by getting a hundred at wellington or had tougher times he stays very much at an even keel which is very much a strength of his
2642588 he makes some difficult things look very easy when the ball wobbles and moves around so i think hes handled himself very well
2642589 its a pressure environment we know that and he knows that and hes desperate to get a score in the second innings
2642590 overcast the ball should swing shoudnt it two hours to bowl them out game over by the afternoon
2642591 youve just got to go and make sure you try and score as many runs as you can
2642592 i still did the right amount of work i normally do
2642593 i just have to give that extra time and responsibility to the other players to build the confidence which keeps me involved that little bit longer at training
2642594 i just play the game i love the nonsense before the game you have to do the scrutiny that goes with it the attention youve got to do it
2642595 but i was so happy when i flipped the coin yesterday and knew the cricket was on its way
2642596 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2642597 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2642598 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out
2642599 timmy has damaged a finger which is quite nasty actually but as all true keepers do he got stuck in and hes carrying on but its quite painful
2642600 it might be broken we dont know but in some ways theres not much point in doing much about it now because the games on so its one of those where well assess it at the end of the game
2642601 hes happy to carry on the doctors seen it and doesnt think he has done any structural damage so hell carry on with painkillers and well sort it out afterwards
2642602 he did brilliantly because it was definitely no more than a half or a third chance
2642603 he got a hand on it but if you watch the footage back hes got an awfully long way to get there
2642604 inside edges are especially difficult for keepers because youre setting yourself for the outside edge all the time
2642605 id give him credit for getting a hand to it actually i wouldnt have got anywhere near it dont worry about that
2642606 timmy handles things really well hes a very level headed bloke
2642607 whether hes done well by getting a hundred at wellington or had tougher times he stays very much at an even keel which is very much a strength of his
2642608 he makes some difficult things look very easy when the ball wobbles and moves around so i think hes handled himself very well
2642609 its a pressure environment we know that and he knows that and hes desperate to get a score in the second innings
2642610 vvs laxman has sprained his ankle and tendulkar hyper extended while fielding and jarred his elbow while ishant landed on glaute buttocks and it is painful from the impact
2642611 i can count the number of days on one hand where youre sweating already before the race even starts
2642612 we had ice packs on our backs already and that never happens
2642613 i dont know whether thats got anything to do with it
2642614 you cant put all the gloominess on china its a worldwide issue
2642615 school prepares you for the real world which also sucks
2642616 i know how you feel but i just dont care
2642617 this is an opportunity for donors to give far more to a candidate than the law allows and still have the candidate know it
2642618 all of this money is going to benefit the presidential candidate and while it might not end up in their own campaign account its going to be working to their benefit its a way for a donor to separate themselves from the pack of run of the mill 2 300 donors and possibly gain greater influence with the candidate
2642619 we think that they are an end around the campaign finance system and more importantly around its intent which is to limit the significance of any one donor in helping a person get elected
2642620 its fairly absurd that you could go from a 2 300 maximum and then kind of wake up from a long sleep and all of the sudden youve figured out how to make it 70 000
2642621 where mccain is hypocritical here is he himself has spoken out again the corrupting influence of big contributions the way that that affects policy in washington
2642622 i cant suspect that mccain would argue that 70 000 is not a big contribution
2642623 obama has really made it seem like his campaign was being driven by small contributions
2642624 and for him to be accepting contributions of tens of thousands of dollars is equally hypocritical to what mccains doing
2642625 the fact that ohioans in traditionally republican counties are supporting sen obama shows that ohioans of all political stripes are ready for a president who will end the same old divisive politics and give hardworking families a voice in washington again
2642626 obviously theres the letter of the law and the spirit of the law
2642627 and mccain is obeying the letter of the law and not the spirit hes championed over the years
2642628 on the other hand once barack obama figured out that he could raise more money than he could get from public financing he seemed to have no problem moving in that direction without even a look back
2642629 as we often say in classes here political parties exist to win elections
2642630 and the fact that people will exploit the weak spots of a particular legislation or regulation to their fullest in order to win those elections shouldnt come as a surprise to people
2642631 can we get you anything a drink of water a pillow
2642632 the secretary general urges all parties to immediately end hostilities and to engage without delay in negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement
2642633 the secretary general believes that for the success of this endeavour all armed contingents which are not authorized by respective agreements on south ossetia should leave the zone of conflict
2642634 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks
2642635 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a 110 130 dollar band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2642636 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand
2642637 given recent price experience a spike in excess of 200 dollars per barrel is not infeasible
2642638 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend
2642639 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2642640 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three percent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2642641 i cant think of a single specialist batsman or bowler who played a large number of odi games and did extremely well who could not make it in test cricket
2642642 hurry up guys i want to celebrate christmas off the ship and i cant leave till you have picked up
2642643 shut up and get off your ass to help it will be done faster
2642644 are your legs tired cause youve been running through my dreams all night
2642645 i cant think of a single specialist batsman or bowler who played a large number of odi games and did extremely well who could not make it in test cricket
2642646 i dont think theres really a reason to keep them out of school
2642647 i think education is or should be our first priority and we need to mandate that our kids are there on the first day
2642648 i think kids should go to school and i really respect reverend meeks and i agree with what hes trying to do hes right the funding in illinois education system is not fair
2642649 not a good idea for the boycott kids should stay in school
2642650 you reach a point when you have done all you that you can do and you need to get someone elses attention
2642651 also keep in mind that in birmingham alabama dr martin luther king james bevel and others they used the children to send the point and what happened was when the fire hoses and the dogs were turned on the children thats when america said this is truly enough
2642652 setting a world record you cant ask for anything else
2642653 what if your imaginary friend from childhood was your one true love
2642654 i dont smoke drink gamble do drugs or consort with women of easy virtue i just ride motorcycles

2642656 the time to begin writing an article is when you have finished it to your satisfaction by that time you begin to clearly and logically perceive what it is that you really want to say
2642657 people of the world look at berlin where a wall came down and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
2642658 greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us one from another
2642659 cut off food and supplies to more than two million germans in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in berlin that was when the largest and most unlikely rescue in history brought food and hope to the people of this city
2642660 the idea is to put the palestinians on a diet but not to make them die of hunger
2642661 the idea is to make their lives so intolerable that they lose hope and choose to go somewhere anywhere else
2642662 i just started buying my own because were going through a lot
2642663 i didnt think it was fair for him to always buy them so i thought i should stock up my place
2642664 i kind of went through and bought a whole bunch of other things so they wouldnt stand out
2642665 i guess i didnt really need to buy the other stuff
2642666 but i felt really good about the condoms it felt very responsible actually
2642667 shows like sex and the city desperate housewives and even the view have made a major impact
2642668 these women have all given us the permission to take ownership of our own minds and bodies and know that its ok to seek information and demand answers when it comes to our bodies and sexuality
2642669 almost every woman is concerned and interested with their own pleasure but many are too afraid to talk about it
2642670 knowledge can be very empowering and the majority of women attending our parties are definitely looking for ways to attain pleasure and a healthier happier sex life
2642671 of all the things i cant believe i forgot that
2642672 women are coming into their own in that they are seeking information and asking questions
2642673 they are truly looking for ways to better intimacy with themselves and in their relationships

2642769 as the web continues to evolve and more of our lives move online we believe that web browsers like firefox can and should do more to broker rich experiences while increasing user control over their data and personal information
2642770 when i get down on my knees its not to pray
2642771 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
2642772 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
2642773 he threw the ball away which is one of those situations that we talked about
2642774 he made a couple nice throws there on some back shoulder throws
2642775 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2642776 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defense we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish
2642777 weve got to do a little better job of getting the defense off the field right now
2642778 hes a real scrappy guy you look at him hes a smaller guy but he goes out and plays with a big heart
2642779 he just felt a little tweak i guess but i dont know
2642780 it was a good touchdown for us and we got off to a good start
2642781 i threw some good balls but they made some good defensive plays
2642782 it was a good start and it felt good to be out there playing against someone else
2642783 it felt great for us as a team to move the ball that way
2642784 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2642785 we had a couple of missed formations a couple of forced passes a couple of inaccurate throws but thats going to happen in a preseason game thats why were playing these games we want to work those kinks out
2642786 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge

2642792 while in d c you insulted my office called me a false messiah and said i am a lawbreaker you begged various entities to investigate me as if i were a common criminal what you are really doing is pandering to a small vocal constituency that supports open borders and refuses to see the collateral damage caused by unchecked illegal immigration

2642848 i went with mr lanneau to the place where the jews are permitted to purchase the right of approaching the site of their temple and of paying and wailing over its ruins and the downfall of their nation two old men jews sat there upon the ground reading together in a book of hebrew prayers on fridays they assemble here in greater numbers it is the nearest point in which they can venture to approach their ancient temple here bowed in the dust they may at least weep undisturbed over the fallen glory of their race and bedew with their tears the soil which so many thousands of their forefathers once moistened with their blood this touching custom of the jew is not of modern origin benjamin of tudela mentions it as apparently connected with the same spot in the twelfth century and very probably the custom has come down from still earlier ages the jew who was our guide on approaching the many stones took off his shoes and kissed the wall

2642877 kami sedang menunggu informasi dari tbilisi ibukota georgia kalaupun kami benar akan mengundurkan diri dari olimpiade hal itu akan menjadi keputusan seluruh warga georgia kami semua akan bersatu
2642878 ketika kembang api dinyalakan di langit china pada pembukaan olimpiade hari jumat di china georgia sedang menghadapi pengeboman dan penyerangan di daerah daerah seperti gori kareli poti senaki kutaisi bolnisi and marneuli
2642879 perbatasan udara georgia berulangkali dilanggar oleh pesawat militer federasi rusia dan sekarang invasi rusia telah berkembang menjadi intervensi militer penuh yang menyerang seluruh bagian georgia
2642880 georgia meminta perhatian dunia internasional untuk menegaskan kepada rusia bahwa penyerangan dan pengeboman ke wilayah negara yang berdaulat sangat tidak bisa diterima di abad ke 21 ini
2642881 kami berharap agar burung merpati yang dilepas jumat lalu di bird nest akan menyadarkan rusia untuk mengembalikan kedamaian di negara kami
2642882 kami belum dapat memastikan apakah korban mati akibat terkena peluru atau tidak sehingga melalui otopsi kita dapat mengetahuinya sekaligus agar proses hukum berjalan sebagaimana mestinya
2642883 kalau presiden sby beberapa waktu lalu mengingatkan agar tidak boros bbm itu sebenarnya bukan untuk seluruh masyarakat di indonesia karena sebenarnya kita ini bukan negara boros bbm
2642884 konsumsi ini sangat rendah kalau melihat jumlah penduduk indonesia yang mencapai 230 juta jiwa bandingkan dengan taiwan yang penduduknya hanya 16 juta jiwa namun konsumsi bbm bisa mencapai satu juta barel per hari padahal taiwan bukan produsen minyak
2642885 justru pemborosan itu terjadi di jakarta bukan di seluruh wilayah indonesia
2642886 hanya sekarang ini sulit mencari ladang ladang minyak baru exxon mobil di blok cepu saja sampai saat ini masih tahap eksplorasi belum eksploitasi
2642887 ada spekulasi harga minyak akan turun jika barrack obama terpilih menjadi presiden as karena dia memiliki perhatian yang cukup besar terhadap krisis yang terjadi di irak
2642888 kalau sampai harganya di bawah 100 dolar as per barel tentu opec akan melakukan perlawanan atau para produsen minyak akan malas berproduksi
2642889 sebenarnya kita ini masih punya minyak berapa tak seorang pun pengamat maupun pihak pertamina bisa menjelaskan persoalan ini namun yang jelas indonesia tidak lagi masuk dalam jajaran negara yang memproduksi minyak

2642898 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2642899 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2642900 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2642901 em conjunto me parece que a equipe est bem esperamos ter um desempenho melhor neste domingo j que n s somos bastante fortes no cross country
2642902 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2642903 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2642904 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2642905 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2642906 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2642907 hey honey look at the pillow i made i even lined up the prints and everything
2642908 all my friends have phones my parents wont get one for me unless i pay for it
2642909 stephanie rice of australia went out extremely fast and held on at the end to win the womens 400 im in 4 29 45 nearly 2 seconds faster than the world record of 4 31 12 set by
2642910 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2642911 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2642912 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2642913 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2642914 i see you are from arkansas i spent some time there once and went on a blind date with the ugliest woman ive ever seen
2642915 for all those times that you wished you remembered where you put that one thing
2642916 przestali ucieka si do przemocy i wycofali si z osetii po udniowej
2642917 it takes a lot of time but its what im happy putting my name on
2642918 the color might go over the line its like working wet on wet with watercolor
2642919 there are a number of techniques its very challenging and very unforgiving
2642920 its not unusual for me to have four scarves in process at one time
2642921 usually things are made and out of here so fast
2642922 it took me a long time to find something i love like silk painting
2642923 the important thing was not to lose any more structural integrity
2642924 its a thrill for us to have even a small impact on what someday could be a great attraction in the city
2642925 we had 650 children involved in summer programs including story times and the summer reading program and a field trip to phipps conservatory
2642926 libraries traditionally see an increase in usage when the economy is bad
2642927 we had to delay start dates because we physically didnt have a seat for new employees
2642928 we have a great commitment to quality that you dont always see in bigger companies
2642929 often young students tell me they want to make a splash
2642930 ill say well let me tell you what john chapman told me
2642931 he expected you to engage in intellectual conversation with him hed give you a list of books and ask you to tell him what you thought about them
2642932 he always made you feel you had something important to say
2642933 but he felt that with the war over what was the point of continuing to put his people in danger
2642934 there is still a chance that we could have both grocery stores
2642935 we are not a full service grocery store but we are a full product grocery store and we offer very competitive prices especially in underserved communities
2642936 we should think about this as the long needed expansion and development of centre avenues business corridor
2642937 this is what the future of centre avenue should be
2642938 our goal is to encourage foot traffic that will bring about development in this area
2642939 i was born and raised in east liberty and i have seen how a grocery store can change a community look at what whole foods has done in east liberty
2642940 we are not whole foods but we have been operating in this region for many years now
2642941 10 or 15 years ago because this was a hard place
2642942 this was a chance to give people a sense of the decision we have to make and we are extremely excited that we even have a choice between two very good proposals
2642943 i didnt want to work a dead end minimum wage job
2642944 but without any skills thats what i was looking at doing
2642945 i really wanted to go to school but i didnt know how i was going to afford it
2642946 pretty much everything ive gotten except for the studying which i had to do on my own was through the keys program
2642947 our students are all on some type of public assistance so they cant get to school if they dont have gas for their cars or food or day care for their kids
2642948 the students need to have a service plan which is what i help them develop and they have to turn in paperwork to us every week to show they are meeting their requirements
2642949 we do help the student secure grants and loans to pay for it
2642950 this program really was a way for me to earn all my prerequisites
2642951 its been really great things i didnt know were available to me ive gotten through keys
2642952 that is definitely part of the problem getting the word out that this exists
2642953 thats why we really want to get the word out if you really want to go to school if you want a degree come see us
2642954 the support from this community from the county commissioners has been overwhelming
2642955 i think it speaks to the excitement we have generated here
2642956 for the 18 year olds who want to go away and experience life this isnt the program for them
2642957 but half of our students are older and they arent interested in living on a college campus for them this provides the opportunity to earn a bachelors degree without ever having to leave the area
2642958 starting gate provides low or no rent options for business owners for at least a year
2642959 the only caveat is if you take advantage of this you have to set up shop in lawrence county
2642960 once we have this building in place we can then do what community colleges do well which is workforce development
2642961 in the next five to 10 years i expect this will be a fully developed college campus
2642962 i did work as a professional actor after i got out of the marine corps in the 1970s
2642963 after i got married i kind of drifted away from it but kept my foot in the door for the next 30 years in amateur theater productions
2642964 when arthur saw me perform in the schools production of two gentlemen from verona he came up to me and said you are definitely an actor
2642965 he saw something in me and spent the next three years coaching me to this day i phone him once a week to discuss theater
2642966 people were telling me i had what it takes but the new york theater world is tough
2642967 thats why i decided to jump on my motorcycle and travel around the country looking for an acting job
2642968 i phoned the theater and told them id like to come to washington to try out
2642969 the tuesday after memorial day they granted me an audition the very next day they called back to say they wanted me to play the role of george
2642970 so far weve been able to handle care appropriately when physicians are called up and we really support doctors and other clinicians when it happens
2642971 we have the feeling that everyone needs to do his part
2642972 from the broader spectrum of things doctors are important to the military in healing soldiers we do our part regardless of the direct impact on upmc
2642973 i have my own children and when you see a child ripped to shreds by a land mine it really hits home
2642974 basically it goes from boredom to pure chaos sometimes you are playing cards and 10 minutes later you are operating for 24 to 48 hours straight
2642975 signed the contract on the dotted line with the military
2642976 now you just shrug your shoulders and say oh well
2642977 its very very hard but im fortunate to have great partners
2642978 people are not going to want to hear from me
2642979 they are going to say what does she want me to sign up for now
2642980 julie is a great person for the group as she is in the age range but most importantly she has great insight about business as well as being a true professional
2642981 she reacted with wonderful enthusiasm and cooperation julie was very excited about this new group and recognized the need
2642982 we want to take the focus off the less mundane networking aspect
2642983 if something positive business wise comes of it thats great but its not the emphasis
2642984 hopefully the group will help retain talented young people and promote getting involved in the community
2642985 i think a lot of young people want to get involved but they just dont know where to turn
2642986 i was 27 and it was scary to take the plunge
2642987 but its been great its nice to make your own decisions
2642988 its kind of nice having a block of time to myself i can recap the day and plan for the next one
2642989 not only did she photograph someone at an event but her reflection is in the guys glasses as well
2642990 i just love that picture i really do it was purely accident to be honest with you
2642991 she told this story and that was something very different and we appreciated that as well
2642992 the pure joy in the little boys face really touched all the judges
2642993 he knew that i sent it in the mail for a contest and he kept asking me did i win a contest yet
2642994 whenever we got the phone call he was very excited about it
2642995 hell be known as the sheep boy for the rest of his life
2642996 it was taken last october my wife and i were biking along the north shore of moraine it was a nice day so i brought my camera along
2642997 i entered three this one wasnt my favorite one but they liked it
2642998 im happy that they do the contest its a great idea to promote the county
2642999 we felt that those three images really filled the bill as far as what we were asking people for
2643000 three boys in alameda park just having a grand time
2643001 we had fishing shots we got quite a few rodeo shots this year and a whole lot of kids playing which is wonderful

2643004 require all states to conduct primaries to select their delegates to future national conventions
2643005 caucuses inherently disenfranchise the elderly disabled shift workers single parents and others whose circumstances prohibit participation in caucuses further the 2008 primaries illustrated that a caucus vote is worth more than a primary vote because each delegate elected by caucuses represents fewer votes than each delegate elected by primary
2643006 this is not about looking back its about looking forward
2643007 the amazing spirit of cooperation that he said committee officers and the obama campaign had exhibited in dealing with his concerns
2643008 democrats have learned that platform fights dont get you anywhere
2643009 it just makes me so sad said ms holmes norton
2643010 ive just been to a reception and a meeting and i didnt hear anyone mention it
2643011 a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2643012 this is the pinnacle of our protest for the 47 million americans without health care
2643013 we know what works social security works medicare works and we want to give everyone that under a single payer and control executive salaries profiteering waste and abuse
2643014 people are stunned that we go into debt for health care
2643015 if it was a drug store that went out of business we wouldnt investigate that
2643016 i think the call volume dropped so low they werent making any money
2643017 the powers that be whoever they are should give us some answers
2643018 there was never any defined leader maybe that was part of the problem
2643019 we were basically forced out of business there were greater forces at work against us
2643020 others have gone out of business but they always give us a plan
2643021 and if he was able to give financial support to a family who needed it he did
2643022 he didnt want to have to travel anymore he wanted to spend more time with us and give us a better life
2643023 it was a little bit of a rough ride for the first couple of years
2643024 it wasnt immediately successful we had a lot of lean years but i was just a little kid so i didnt know any better back then
2643025 whatever we were into and doing he was also very involved with
2643026 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2643027 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman that we could all identify with
2643028 many children enjoy ben amp jerrys but by the companys own standards its ice cream is not safe
2643029 the level of dioxin in a single serving of the ben amp jerrys worlds best vanilla ice cream which we tested was almost 200 times greater than the epas virtually safe daily dose
2643030 there is nothing we can do about the levels of dioxins in our ice cream
2643031 no lo pod amos creer en principio pensamos que era otra persona pero cuando lo mostraron bien y dijeron su nombre todos quedamos perplejos
2643032 en colombia nos amenazaron nos dijeron que si no tra amos ese aparato igual iban a matar a nuestras familias
2643033 lo que nos dijeron y por la comida y la gasolina que ten amos era que bamos a hacer un viaje de 10 d as
2643034 nos tocaba dormir en tablas de 60 cent metros y lo hac amos por turnos de seis horas mientras tres estaban trabajando uno dorm a
2643035 las estimaciones indican que hasta el 40 por ciento de la coca na en colombia se mueve por la compleja red fluvial hasta el sur de la costa occidental
2643036 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
2643037 i turned around and thought i saw a 4 31
2643038 i thought that really hurt for a 4 31 i was stoked when it turned over its an amazing achievement it hasnt kicked in yet
2643039 todas esas acciones comandan a cada individuo y se reflejan en su comportamiento
2643040 torpes en la vida cotidiana o en el manejo de los contextos socioafectivos
2643041 voy a dejar de pensar en el fin de semana y me voy a concentrar en este reporte
2643042 se ha encontrado un desempe o acad mico superior en otros colegios y estados que se han enfocado en fortalecer la funci n ejecutiva
2643043 si se tiene en cuenta que el gobierno nacional est pensando en m s actividades de control e insiste en un proyecto de reforma constitucional en este sentido es til se alar que probablemente esto no va a tener un impacto importante a mediano y a largo plazo
2643044 es la primera base firme para estudiar este f rmaco en el tratamiento de c ncer en pacientes
2643045 were seeing double the number of beach closings this year
2643046 its been an extraordinarily wet summer sewage systems cant handle intense rain
2643047 many are gastrointestinal but respiratory illness and ear infections are also factors
2643048 it usually takes 24 hours or two tide cycles for the water to flush out and the bacteria count to go down at beaches
2643049 when the bacteria count gets that high its just not a good idea to go swimming
2643050 with the various clergy they say i just cant understand the boiler
2643051 you expect me to understand the resurrection and you cant understand the boiler
2643052 we realized that we were just heating the world apparently with greenhouse emissions and letting heat go out the windows
2643053 for us they played a very instrumental role initiating the concern so that the parish feels that theres an independent source confirming the need for the investment
2643054 highly manipulative self protective person who is also quite bright and creative
2643055 this is a person who needs to be the center of attention
2643056 this is a man who both under and then overestimates his abilities
2643057 they also show that he is not grounded in reality
2643058 this gives us time to review their research and see if theres any validity to it and if in fact we need to take any corrective action
2643059 if what the mit undergrads claim in their public announcements is true public disclosure of the security flaws before the mbta and its system vendors have an opportunity to correct the flaws will cause significant damage to the mbtas transit system
2643060 we initially called them the t to offer them our help in fixing these vulnerabilities
2643061 we have no intention of releasing details that would allow someone to replicate the attacks that can be done
2643062 where do community groups go to have meetings if church space can no longer be free we used to be able to say sure you can use our space now we really have to think about it
2643063 we dont have the option of doing anything else we just have to spend the money to do what we have to do
2643064 what are you going to do cover all your windows with plastic oh sure thats going to look great
2643065 there is a limit to what people will put up with there are no simple solutions
2643066 were being very conscious making sure in the cold weather that the windows are shut
2643067 he was like batman before there was batman always going into different roles like his dad he was an artist and he always had crazy ideas i think simon accepted that his son was a little bit different more anti authority living in fantasy
2643068 he just packed his stuff and then he left in the night
2643069 he didnt even really think about it beforehand he just left his dad said hes never coming back but simon was optimistic about it it was quite tight here in the little village and he wanted to see the world
2643070 i dont know what i have to say to my brother
2643071 i never thought he would return it seems he was very far from reality
2643072 its costing us an arm and a leg that we could actually be using to revitalize our congregation to open our doors to do great ministry but were paying fuel costs
2643073 we just looked at the price of heating oil and said oh my god something has got to be done
2643074 in 2007 more than 40 000 people entered our sanctuary to pray escape the weather ask for help or simply take a look
2643075 keeping our doors open is a significant commitment rising energy costs challenge us but with your support they cannot defeat us
2643076 well probably have to take an extra collection to help out given the way that peoples finances are its just making it worse to the point you might have to consider cutting staff
2643077 the only way i can describe it is i was just very young and wanted it now that day right now
2643078 i do feel like i made a rash decision its one of those things what am i going to tell my kids i feel like i want to tell people to know what you want before getting one
2643079 kids dont realize the implications of this in the workplace thats the problem
2643080 you have an older generation whos hiring a new generation and theyre making judgments on the younger generation because they have tattoos
2643081 but when andrew lloyd webber was on the show he told her cover it up when you sing my song people noticed they didnt show her husband
2643082 i have tattoos but if i want to wear a suit no one will know i have ink on my body
2643083 its like an anklet its there if you want people to see it you can cover it up if you dont want people to see it
2643084 and hopefully the results will speak for themselves in the future
2643085 considering that public housing serves the states poorest families and individuals who are at risk of homelessness this increase in operating subsidy is very important
2643086 there are situations where you might be able to put a homeless person in public housing but you may see entire buildings offline they need to be totally redone
2643087 there hasnt been enough funding over the years to keep up maintenance
2643088 massachusetts is one of the highest housing costs states in the country and its been that way for some time thats no secret
2643089 people from all kinds of backgrounds have things happen in their lives that can bring them here
2643090 ahora cuando estamos tan interesados en celebrar los 200 a os de la independencia deber amos mirar la gesta libertadora no como una acci n aislada en cada naci n sino desde la perspectiva de las demandas de la globalizaci n una gesta en la que se unieron las fuerzas de bol var y santander que luego incorpor ecuatorianos chilenos argentinos fue un momento en el que la futura am rica latina se uni de manera mancomunada
2643091 el historiador cumple una funci n pol tica crucial en la sociedad al tratar de entender desde procesos pasados el presente y alimentar cr ticamente su memoria
2643092 en este ltimo punto es clave la b squeda de la verdad hist rica por ejemplo en los procesos de violencia y reparaci n a las v ctimas en el sentido de buscar la explicaci n de lo ocurrido para as contribuir a evitar que eso se repita
2643093 en un contexto como el nuestro que ha naturalizado la impunidad la memoria es un espacio de lucha pol tica en el cual el historiador debe involucrarse como actor social asumir la construcci n de memoria de procesos y proyectos pol ticos que fueron silenciados y generar resultados que doten de herramientas a los grupos minoritarios y d biles para combatir la censura y el olvido
2643094 se ha sucedido una revoluci n silenciosa en colombia y no la hemos registrado
2643095 por primera vez en la historia de colombia desde 1985 m s colombianos viven en tierra caliente que en los altiplanos
2643096 estos elementos nuevos que muestran cambios no los vemos ni los registramos
2643097 de pronto la crisis de la sociolog a y el nfasis indigenista de la antropolog a dejan coja a la historia en el an lisis de la coyuntura
2643098 m s que ense arles sobre los procesos se presentan los personajes y los acontecimientos fuera de contexto se les ofrecen interpretaciones muy caprichosas
2643099 constatamos la innovaci n tem tica y metodol gica que muchos maestros y planteles educativos est n realizando
2643100 se desestiman los contenidos hist ricos porque se asocian con cargas pesadas de informaci n poco tiles para la vinculaci n al mercado laboral
2643101 los contenidos ef meros de la memoria transmitida por los medios de comunicaci n
2643102 que despu s de muchos a os llegue un polic a a tu puerta y te pregunte si tuviste sexo con alguien y te diga que ser s investigado porque posiblemente lo contagiaste de vih es aterrador
2643103 en un pa s en el que ser acondropl sico es casi un castigo hemos logrado con el alargamiento de los huesos de piernas y brazos permitirles llevar una vida digna pues logran una independencia que no ten an antes pero este no es una panacea para todos ni es todo lo que el estado puede hacer por ellos
2643104 la mayor a cree que los enanos s lo sirven para los circos cuando los ven se r en y los se alan por qu no hacen lo mismo con quienes son cojos o minusv lidos los acondropl sicos al igual que ellos tienen una incapacidad pero el trato es diferente
2643105 seg n beijing son una red muy fuerte conectada con al qaeda y hay numerosos grupos que representan una amenaza inminente y grave pero nunca ha demostrado que sea as los informes chinos sobre el terreno no se corresponden con una realidad por ejemplo es casi imposible encontrar militantes del etim ni siquiera en los pa ses vecinos
2643106 la situaci n no difiere de la del t bet donde el gobierno chino intenta remodelar una religi n para controlar una minor a tnica
2643107 significar xinjiang anular los uigures asimilarlos o excluirlos del proceso de desarrollo

2643111 it takes a lot of time but its what im happy putting my name on
2643112 the color might go over the line its like working wet on wet with watercolor
2643113 there are a number of techniques its very challenging and very unforgiving
2643114 its not unusual for me to have four scarves in process at one time
2643115 usually things are made and out of here so fast
2643116 it took me a long time to find something i love like silk painting
2643117 i am confident users will be very pleased with the 4 6 2 release
2643118 the language manager work we started with the initial 4 6 release is now complete my hats off to all the developers and translators that helped make this happen
2643119 the bug stomps helped us confirm things were working on as many different environments as possible i am proud to say the community rose to the challenge and the release is all the better for it
2643120 he who is elevated for the moment but serves the rest
2643121 i think people wanted something different and this event has never been themed
2643122 we wanted to update a few things and make it a better event for our guests
2643123 special teams were solid which of course was important to us
2643124 jeff reed banged a kick home that he didnt bang home at practice up at latrobe the other day that was by design to put him in that situation and jeff delivered
2643125 we have a long way to go in regards to that he did a nice showing for himself tonight but we are still exploring options at that spot
2643126 he showed us the things that he has been showing us in latrobe and that he has been showing us even going back into the spring at the south side facility lawrence is a run and hit guy he did that tonight and made some plays for us
2643127 i thought that we ran to the ball although we were sloppy tackling at times which is kind of indicative of the first preseason game
2643128 there is a silver lining in those situations because you get put on the short field and you have to stand up in the red zone we made them kick a few field goals i thought that was good
2643129 all in all it was a productive outing the first time out
2643130 to go up to the fence and pat a melbourne cup winner like doriemus thats a magical experience especially for kids some of them have never been near a horse before
2643131 and the horses love the attention kids are like a drug for 1997 melbourne cup winner might and power if theres kids around hes there lapping it up
2643132 i dont think they can help it even at their age
2643133 we had no idea about that when we were looking for a site but it all seemed to fit
2643134 i saw it as an opportunity for people to focus on funding research education
2643135 the home of rest for horses in britain is the biggest funder of equine research and education in the uk theyve rebuilt all the vets schools and hospitals in the uk
2643136 one of the main things for me is seeing the interaction between the people and the horses
2643137 i flew with him from hong kong and they put him in a float and pulled him all over the airport underneath jets that were screaming then put him in a cargo hold
2643138 he had a bit of a stretch bucked a bit looked left looked right then settled right down
2643139 he stands taller his veins are sticking out and hes all business hes ready to race
2643140 people ask who your favourite is but you cant choose between your children
2643141 to be part of that if i can help thats my mind set im just trying to get back out there
2643142 i played against ben competed against him in college it was fun
2643143 i dont think it was an issue with my production when on the football field it was just the time i missed because of injuries believe me i wasnt trying to do that
2643144 it was going so good for me then came the injuries its something i understand and something i have to live with
2643145 right now im really anxious to get back out there on the field
2643146 i think anytime you get a chance to play for a team like this with this much tradition you do it
2643147 just to be part of it playing against those guys they were always a well coached good football team
2643148 i dont know what the situation is i dont know the process
2643149 i just want to come in and try to work my butt off
2643150 the destruction of family businesses is often used as a motivation for repealing the estate tax but there is very little proof that many family businesses are devastated by the tax
2643151 there are very few ways to get around the tax entirely
2643152 but there are any number of ways to reduce the tax
2643153 you often get a scenario where the relatives who control the business feel like theyre working in part to produce profits for the others who are doing no work
2643154 and the ones who are doing no work are often saying how do i get value for this asset
2643155 how much would someone pay for a 20 percent stake in a franchise when he wouldnt have the deciding vote
2643156 but it would not be at all unreasonable that the combined effect of the minority and marketability discount would be in the 30 to 40 percent range
2643157 our principal concern is where we will find the money
2643158 if the irs comes in with a valuation that is different than what we have we will have a hard time serving the debt in installments
2643159 if there is a proper level of sophistication in the estate planning a family wouldnt be in the position of having to sell its business because of the estate tax with proper planning the inheritance tax isnt a fatal blow
2643160 if you dont have outside assets to sell or life insurance and dont have enough money to pay installments that is where you can have a problem
2643161 almost always there are techniques or other strategies to mitigate any impact from the federal estate tax
2643162 i had forgotten my pin the family pin at home so i borrowed one from someone without a little so id have one to give to d i ended up just paying for it well i finally found my pin the one youd given me since im alumni and im not really involved with anything anymore i thought id give it back
2643163 were looking for the best catch phrase for crest whitening expressions so shawn what have you got
2643164 after five years we wanted to update the formula to ensure we were continuing to offer a great brushing experience
2643165 crest whitening expressions is all about great flavor which ties in perfectly with emerils cooking philosophy of bringing out great flavor experiences

2643169 i wanted to sing on the medal podium but i couldnt stop crying
2643170 i was just happy to get the first one under my belt
2643171 setting a world record you cant ask for anything else
2643172 one is education and helping the consumer understand the transition the second is being there if their tvs are not compliant so far no one is doing an effective job communicating either
2643173 we want to make sure people know that we can provide lower cost solutions when it comes to tvs
2643174 its the duty of all tv brands to educate the consumer
2643175 the digital change is a great chance for our members to market their products but right now that marketing is a delicate balance
2643176 one is education and helping the consumer understand the transition the second is being there if their tvs are not compliant so far no one is doing an effective job communicating either

2643180 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2643181 what they the russians are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2643182 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2643183 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2643184 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks
2643185 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a 110 130 dollar band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2643186 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand
2643187 given recent price experience a spike in excess of 200 per barrel is not infeasible
2643188 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend
2643189 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2643190 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over 3 per cent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2643191 venerable herman of alaska wonderworker of all america a spiritual mission was organized in 1793 made up of monks of the valaam monastery they were sent to preach the word of god to the native inhabitants of northwestern america who only ten years before had come under the sovereignty of russia st herman was among the members of this mission

2643196 lo que es bueno para catalu a es bueno para zapatero
2643197 principal compromiso de la generalitat es estar a la altura de las exigencias de catalu a
2643198 m s all de ser militante socialista soy consejero de la generalitat
2643199 catalu a no va a romper la baraja pero la generalitat est obligada a decir cuando no le gusta el juego
2643200 lo mejor que puede hacer el gobierno es dar un paso adelante con la financiaci n para poder huir de cualquier polarizaci n
2643201 se trata de una propuesta muy seria muy trabajada con muchas posibilidades de que sea aceptada por catalu a
2643202 hay maximalismos en toda negociaci n que puedo entender y respetar pero no as los excesos verbales que es lo que ha cometido el presidente de la generalitat
2643203 habr acercamiento de posiciones porque no hay margen para el desacuerdo
2643204 los partidos de catalu a no pueden pretender recorrer en dos a os lo que no se ha recorrido en veinte
2643205 ya hemos llegado a un l mite en el que no hay marcha atr s
2643206 queremos un buen acuerdo no aceptaremos un mal acuerdo ni un acuerdo a cualquier precio

2643211 estamos con la tranquilidad y la seguridad que zapatero est con las posiciones que defendemos en andaluc a
2643212 i dont like them theyre killers but until we are there were going to have setbacks like this
2643213 1998 and all the late century love should magically appear

2643222 the boys and girls have been with thomas for a long time and realizing the severe injuries that hes had the families wanted to get together and do something that will help the family

2643224 number one everybodys always looking for a reason to have a rummage sale or a way to have a rummage sale and this way we can do both we can clean out our closets and our garages and donate to the gospel mission as well
2643225 he was talking to the parish the other day and he said hes wake up nights wondering how he was going to get the school ready and he said mercy answered their prayers
2643226 in addition to the significant financial investments we need to make for queenslanders we also need to focus at those everyday commonsense reforms that can cost next to nothing yet make life easier and safer for queensland families

2643238 i dont see him going out and throwing like that every night
2643239 he was really really good that night but saturday night he didnt have his best stuff
2643240 sometimes the more success you have against a team the harder they try against you
2643241 it looked like he was on his way again and then we broke through the pitch to hundley he probably wishes he could have that back
2643242 basically it was groundball after groundball and they scratched him for one run

2643253 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2643254 the chinese have done a lot to improve the security situation in xinjiang but the threat in xinjiang is significant so there will be a number of attacks in china during the olympics and after
2643255 but it is very difficult for the terrorist groups to attack in beijing because of the extensive security measures
2643256 we have been appealing to beijing to solve the issue through political dialogue to prevent the situation from deteriorating but they have never taken it seriously
2643257 on the contrary they heightened the suppression beijing should be directly responsible for todays incident
2643258 we cannot determine whether the victim died from gunshot or not we need an autopsy so that we know for sure the cause and we can use it as a basis to pursue further legal actions
2643259 its where we grow it we make it we sell it
2643260 everything is within house we dont have to go anywhere else to get the fuel
2643261 depending on whats happening in the marketplace they will look at crops and make decisions from season to season
2643262 where canola might be a good option this year it may not be the best option next year to decide the future of a crop or make a recommendation on a crop indefinitely is not something thats easily done
2643263 this is a renewable sustainable crop that will come back year in and year out
2643264 you dont have to worry about fermenting it or anything
2643265 you just mix the appropriate chemicals together and shake it up in a jar and youve got biodiesel and biodiesel can be run in any diesel engine without any modifications
2643266 it grows in winter as opposed to summer like soybean so its not competing with soybeans
2643267 the truly independent community hospital is becoming an endangered species because of costs
2643268 its been debated for years whether these partnerships with larger hospitals are good for the local community but the trend is going on nationally and it is expanding
2643269 believes this local control option for hospital management allows the hospital to address the needs expressed by the local community while receiving from quorom the strategic financial and operational direction to be successful
2643270 have become more powerful increasingly mandating that the length of inpatient hospital stays be minimized and that procedures be performed in the most cost effective settings which are often outside the traditional inpatient hospital setting
2643271 youre going to want to be cared for where your family is close at hand
2643272 we do compensate by having arrangements with baptist hospital for cases we cant handle locally
2643273 but we know that community hospitals can be competitive in this day and age with the right mix of physicians staff and operations
2643274 you need to keep it modern and you need to keep surgeons and physicians
2643275 surgery is one of the few things that a hospital can do well and do well for their community so surgery is actually a strength the hospitals that have problems in all kinds of areas have lost their surgical volume
2643276 we have a great general surgeon who is capable of doing a lot
2643277 but there are specialties such as orthopedics neurology and cardiac surgery which are not done here so patients have to go off the mountain to get those services
2643278 certain surgeries will never be done here others can be done here but they dont generate the volume that could sustain a full time position in those cases we try to work with surrounding physicians to try to meet the need locally
2643279 more and more demand is being placed on systems for patient health records e prescribing requirements and tracking quality and price efficiency
2643280 private payers and medicare are going to require much greater sophistication in tracking patient care and these systems are very scalable for the larger hospital system
2643281 alliant provides more resources to hugh chatham than it could have accessed on its own
2643282 but having a board of directors and a medical staff that is engaged in the local community and a community that is supportive of the hospitals is the key to maintaining independence
2643283 enables us to maintain a consistent culture throughout the system as well as set up our own physician network
2643284 most everyone is lining up with one of the larger local health care systems which is understandable
2643285 its becoming more challenging for the independent hospitals to have access to capital to keep their facilities updated buy new equipment and afford the increasing costs of employees
2643286 the recruitment of physicians nurses and therapists is getting fierce
2643287 some hospitals try to handle that by creating partnerships with hospitals that also have major medical schools such as baptist
2643288 seventy percent of our patient care originated outside forsyth county substantially because were a level one trauma center for the region
2643289 we certainly welcome opportunities to explore management options where it makes sense for both hospitals but we also believe it makes good sense to have thriving hospitals in local communities where we can complement them with specialized care and training expertise
2643290 it will be very difficult to remain an independent entity in the face of the changing health care landscape
2643291 all insurance companies are looking for creative ways to not pay us for the services we supply their covered folks
2643292 at the same time the public expects a certain amount of sophisticated technology be available for them if you are absorbed by a health system your ability to focus on your community could be compromised as well as your identity
2643293 it is a fine line to walk and it will become more difficult as changes come down especially from medicare and medicaid
2643294 som ledare kan man antingen ge energi eller ta energi
2643295 i had a really good rest last night and i think practicing for morning swims at the trials really helped
2643296 last night was really weird i felt a bit rushed but this morning i felt more like i normally do in competition
2643297 i watched my race back from yesterday and thought the start wasnt so good and neither was my turn so i went out a bit harder today hopefully ill be able to give it that little bit more tomorrow
2643298 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2643299 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2643300 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2643301 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2643302 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2643303 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2643304 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2643305 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2643306 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2643307 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2643308 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2643309 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2643310 net 30 basis cashouts on february got paid by march
2643311 it was definitely neat to have the president here and have him cheering us all on
2643312 seeing everybody so close together that is not usually how it is after the first 200 that is usually how it is after the 300 mark so i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2643313 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2643314 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and going into the ready room i started getting these kind of like chills up my body
2643315 he had a great race the whole way im proud of him
2643316 he did really good hopefully that performance will help the usa team throughout the rest of the meet
2643317 like i told you guys i am definitely not going to show what i got until the finals
2643318 the entire semi one was watching my race wondering why is he going so slow
2643319 i know lets go check out a real train at the museum
2643320 why not go across the street to the train station
2643321 can we take our son on to see what it looks like
2643322 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2643323 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2643364 we have no problem here when my friend abhishek and i decided to leave for the yatra friends and relatives advised against it
2643365 we faced problems in jammu agitators threw stones on our vehicle at samba and kuthua we thought the worst might be waiting in the valley but we are surprised to see the hospitality and generosity of the people here

2643409 en la pol tica cultural existe hoy una oposici n b sica entre un posmodernismo que se propone deconstruir el modernismo y oponerse al statu quo y un posmodernismo que repudia al primero y elogia al segundo un posmodernismo de resistencia y otro de reacci n
2643410 vemos que surge un posmodernismo de resistencia como una contrapr ctica no s lo de la cultura oficial del modernismo sino tambi n de la falsa normatividad de un posmodernismo reaccionario en oposici n un posmodernismo resistente se interesa por la deconstrucci n cr tica de la tradici n no por un pastiche instrumental de formas pop

2643438 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2643439 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2643440 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2643441 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2643442 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2643443 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2643444 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2643445 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market
2643446 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2643447 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2643448 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa

2643471 never clean your ears with anything smaller than your elbow
2643472 put it down put it down put it down fool
2643473 i had a dream ernie was sleeping in my bed
2643474 worldwide i think the countries that allow this will increase slowly but steadily
2643475 ninth inning in the world series of the marriage debate
2643476 it was four judges in california and four judges in massachusetts
2643477 we would expect that marriage will be both recognized and allowed throughout europe very soon
2643478 i think it will be a great and continuing victory
2643479 the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the lord how to be holy in body and spirit but the married woman is anxious about worldly things how to please her husband i say this for your own benefit not to lay any restraints upon you but to promote good order and to secure your my affection is for him alone i have not felt sundivided devotion to the lord
2643480 im excited about starting a new life together and building a home as husbands
2643481 i basically said wow it looks like gays get married for the same reasons as the straights get married
2643482 the opponents to gay marriage are going to be shocked by how incredibly normal our lives actually are
2643483 when people ask me whats its like being gay i give them a perplexed look they think its some whole separate life
2643484 one day we will be reunited but until then my spirit will always be with you
2643485 i looked across the table one day and realized i did not know the person staring back at me
2643486 an hero to take that shot to leave us all behind
2643487 someone e mailed a clipping of mitchells newspaper obituary to a web site that links to the myspace pages of the dead
2643488 theyd say hi this is mitchell im at the cemetery
2643489 if you dont fall for the joke you get to be in on it
2643490 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
2643491 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had
2643492 anyone who knows who and where you are is a security hole
2643493 i own a gun i have an escape route if someone comes im ready
2643494 im not going to sit here and say oh god please forgive me so someone can feel better
2643495 am i the bad guy am i the big horrible person who shattered someones life with some information no this is life welcome to life everyone goes through it ive been through horrible stuff too
2643496 jason is a young man in a great deal of emotional pain
2643497 killing yourself over a myspace boy come on i mean yeah your fat so you have to take what you can get but still nobody should kill themselves over it
2643498 leading on confused people why dont people fact check who this stuff is coming from why do they assume its true
2643499 a normal person who does insane things on the internet
2643500 do you know how many ive killed at his command
2643501 hacks like this tell you to watch out by hitting you with a baseball bat
2643502 demonstrating these kinds of exploits is usually the only way to get them fixed
2643503 so the message is buy a helmet and the medium is a bat to the head
2643504 no its like a pitcher telling a batter to put on his helmet by beaning him from the mound if you have this disease and youre on the internet you need to take precautions
2643505 i look in the mirror i see my hair is black
2643506 thats uh interesting i guess you understand that you have green hair about as well as you understand that youre a terrible reporter
2643507 why didnt you get so defensive when i said you had green hair
2643508 you seem to know exactly how much you can get away with and you troll right up to that line
2643509 is there anything that can be done on the internet that shouldnt be done
2643510 i want everyone off the internet bloggers are filth they need to be destroyed blogging gives the illusion of participation to a bunch of retards we need to put these people in the oven
2643511 plankton levels are dropping bees are dying there are tortilla riots in mexico the highest wheat prices in 30 odd years
2643512 the question we have to answer is how do we kill four of the worlds six billion people in the most just way possible
2643513 we need someone to show us the way the messiah
2643514 loki was a hacker the other gods feared him but they needed his tools
2643515 be conservative in what you do be liberal in what you accept from others
2643516 while drews conduct is immoral it is a very big stretch to call it illegal
2643517 people know to be deeply skeptical of what they read on the front of a supermarket tabloid
2643518 it should be even more so with anonymous comments they shouldnt start off with a credibility rating of say 0 it should be more like negative 30
2643519 but i can look at you while youre burning in the fire and not be required to help
2643520 allows me to find people who do stupid things and turn them around zach asked if i thought i could turn my parents around i almost broke down the idea of them learning from their mistakes and becoming people that i could actually be proud of it was overwhelming
2643521 its not that i do this because i hate them i do this because im trying to save them
2643522 ultimately the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards
2643523 what makes a bad person or a good person how do you know if youre a bad person
2643524 a good person is someone who follows the rules a bad person is someone who doesnt
2643525 there is no morality only the right of the superior to rule over the inferior
2643526 were going to turn into wormchow before the rest of the universe even notices
2643527 will be reported in next weeks report for friday august 8 2008
2643528 think you know who this man is possibly president of the united states read below and ask yourselves is this really someone we can see as the president of our great nation below are a few lines from obamas books in his own words
2643529 given our budget problems there are not a lot of state resources to apply thats why were being creative in trying to get everyone to participate
2643530 there wont be any silver bullet i think it will take multiple creative solutions
2643531 besides floods and tornadoes this is an issue that is front and center larsen said
2643532 knowing that republicans will be the majority party next legislative session
2643533 getting the budget under control addressing our massive infrastructure problem energy and school funding that will always be there
2643534 so many things have to happen first i need to get through the primary get elected and republicans have to take the house
2643535 we have to get past the not in my backyard approach to these problems
2643536 i asked nrc are you folks looking out to make sure things are being done right they said its not our job what exactly is the nrcs job if its not to insure safety
2643537 i cannot graduate enough engineers because i cant get enough students into the pipeline

2643542 right now the joint ceasefire committee is thrashing things out so the arrangement can push through but until that is threshed out there will be tensions because the military is continuing to open fire
2643543 de vries theory and reduction a nutshell treat of regarding google stores ledger
2643544 despite his advanced age ta ada engaged in street activism and braved the bullying and assaults of the armed personnel of the state
2643545 we need to refresh and revitalize ourselves with the principles that he enunciated so lucidly and so vigorously and with the actions that he undertook and which made him an exemplary fighter for the national and democratic rights and interests of the people
2643546 we are confronted by a government that is shamelessly servile to us imperialism extremely corrupt and exploitative and unrestrained in repressing the people and committing human rights violations
2643547 we are required by his teachings and example to fight relentlessly against the us imposed policy of free market globalization
2643548 the arroyo regime has been the worst in treasonously increasing the pretexts for us military intervention and for actually allowing the continuous and increasing presence of us military forces in the philippines
2643549 leaderships highest usage is to advance the purposes of god in this world
2643550 27 million people in our modern world live in slavery
2643551 in the developing world somewhere between 60 85 of the people in prison have never been convicted or charged with a crime
2643552 take their strengths on a more demanding climb in life
2643553 everyone ive seen fail as a leader has not failed to lead others they have failed to lead themselves
2643554 we cant change people but we can change the cultural soil
2643555 that socrates should ever have been so treated by the athenians
2643556 anytus and meletus may put me to death to injure me is beyond their power
2643557 if such be the will of god so let it be
2643558 rice has been grown in thailand for such a long that the relationship between rice and the thai people is inextricable
2643559 rice is more than a crop or a livelihood it gives rise to culture and traditions
2643560 its actually an old hairdryer but we are in a rush so i figured we needed to have another one for everyone to get ready in time
2643561 well its awkward that theres this new or old hairdryer here very awkward
2643562 i have tried everything youve said what should i do
2643563 unfortunately our technical support have no other solution is is possible for you to use another pc
2643564 get off from high horse and face with blah blah blah
2643565 we cant neglect the threats from international terrorism forces either
2643566 all levels should sign letters of responsibility with management objectives get clear of their responsibilities one by one study the measures to implement task by task and assign tasks unit by unit individual by individual
2643567 its as if the whole society has been put on duty
2643568 with leaflets distributed everywhere telling us that if we see suspicious people or people coming to beijing to appeal or people passing out leaflets we have to report them
2643569 transport is really inconvenient if you go out maybe youre a little busy and you forget your id that means big trouble theres a sign on our street that says report any foreigners to the police and there are leaflets stipulating all kinds of rules they are scared that city residents will tell foreigners about the real situation here were all put under a lot of pressure
2643570 its as if a national disaster is upon us the authorities response is if you are inconvenienced please understand its just like during the sars period society has been sealed up with restrictions on movement and interaction people who come in from outside have to apply and register
2643571 high performing site specific search engine on just about every content rich web site that is worth its salt
2643572 with a growing mass of web content from blogs news sites image and video archives personal web sites and more internet users have an option to turn not only to the major search engines but also to search engines on individual sites as vehicles to reach the information they are looking for
2643573 i would speculate that theres so much information out there that no other organizational tool can manage the volumes of content that people online consume
2643574 search has become an essential utility for almost all internet users
2643575 the broad themes for each of these qualifiers remains the same as last year with discount applying to consumer goods cheap to travel free to low price point items deals to travel and used to books and cars
2643576 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2643577 i shop here because the standards are higher so yes this really concerns me
2643578 we will continue to investigate to see what is happening at the plant to see what they have to do to get a handle on their food safety issues
2643579 but from seeing it today the video was a little brighter than the real effect
2643580 but most viewers thought it was live shots and our work achieved its effect
2643581 to lie is to make someone believe that which is untrue
2643582 it was improvisational questions and answers with host russell brand just like other promo guest stars ll cool j and pete wentz did russell joked about there being sexual tension and britney shot back i dont feel the tension the other joke was about no one knowing who russell was so she called him by the wrong name ll called him russell bland and britney called him russell brown
2643583 the joke of the whole thing is there is an elephant in the room
2643584 well nothing right now to tell you the truth and we have another command within necc and i mentioned it in my opening remarks the expeditionary training command who works fairly closely with the international training division from yorktown and they do somewhat similar mission in that they go overseas and train foreign navies foreign coast guards in maritime security related areas and they in part to stand up they worked very closely with the international training division because they were kind of the pros from dover at the time and we still have a lot to learn from them and well continue to work very closely with them theres potential in the future for us at maritime civil affairs group to combine with the expeditionary training command to work kind of hand in hand on developing better partnerships and alliances and helping them you know the foreign navies for instance to become better partners in this long war and to help make them more secure and stable so theres potential in the future for all of us to work together with the coast guard
2643585 in what seems to be a repeat of what happened in july a few news sites have mentioned that there is evidence of a campaign against georgia
2643586 besides the fact that i can put more creativity into my music i can also take more and newer music to a gig
2643587 its all about the music and not about the tricks
2643588 i know how to run your life better than you do
2643589 in addition to the significant financial investments we need to make for queenslanders we also need to focus at those everyday commonsense reforms that can cost next to nothing yet make life easier and safer for queensland families
2643590 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2643591 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2643592 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal
2643593 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september
2643594 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october
2643595 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders
2643596 they certainly have had some financing issues in recent months but i dont think there is any evidence non bank lenders are going to disappear completely and they will continue to provide some competition
2643597 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2643598 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2643599 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2643600 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it
2643601 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
2643602 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2643603 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2643604 senator mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back
2643605 and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time
2643606 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realising that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2643607 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2643608 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2643609 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2643610 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2643611 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2643612 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2643613 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2643614 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2643615 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2643616 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2643617 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2643618 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2643619 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2643620 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2643621 the arguments in favour of appreciation pre date recent concerns over inflation simply put china cannot rebalance its economy with a severely undervalued currency we expect rapid appreciation to continue
2643622 it was a dark grey object and it was flying parallel to the ground
2643623 i dont want to get as i said last night prematurely stressed about it
2643624 but if it does happen then i will take due time to make sure that whatever decision that i come up with is what i think is the best decision for territorians and for the territory
2643625 i will have to consider their policies for the future and look at the talent on each side
2643626 all i want is to go back to the howard springs tavern have a steak a cold beer and rest my feet

2643644 cmon america when i say i wanna kill these kids you know what i mean
2643645 i just say what she told me except i do it in a comedic form
2643646 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2643647 we thought it would be better for him to get on the bus because its a far drive
2643648 now he keeps saying that he should have driven himself
2643649 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2643650 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2643651 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2643652 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2643653 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2643654 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on nonuse of force with south ossetians
2643655 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2643656 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2643657 all parties to immediately end hostilities and to engage without delay in negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement
2643658 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2643659 profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhazia zone of conflict including the bombing of the upper kodori valley and the ongoing military buildup along the security zone
2643660 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2643661 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2643662 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2643663 everyone is suffering with this its too early to say what might have motivated this were just a few hours from learning the worst possible news
2643664 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2643665 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2643666 our priority in this hour is to attend to the needs of the family members the u s olympic mens indoor volleyball team and staff and the entire u s olympic delegation
2643667 the usoc is working closely with the united states embassy united states law enforcement authorities and local chinese law enforcement authorities
2643668 weve heard the reports weve got people on the scene
2643669 we are not at liberty to say any more out of respect to the presumed victims
2643670 it is understood at this time that a lone assailant was responsible who shortly afterwards committed suicide
2643671 she has a little bit of her great grandmother in her doesnt she

2643681 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2643682 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2643683 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it

2643687 no meu grupo comenta ant n eu era o nico que ti a estudos universitarios sempre encontras xente moi variada tanto no que respecta orixe como a formaci n e interese unha experiencia que enriquece moito e que che permite co ecer a xente coa que noutras circunstancias ser a moi dif cil trabar amistade
2643688 aqueles que non est n dispostos a traballar ao mesmo ritmo que os seus compa eiros acaban marchando aos poucos d as ben porque non aguantan as condici ns ou ben porque aos patr ns non lles interesa telos ocupando unha praza de outra persoa que vaia realmente traballar
2643689 un traballo de equipo no que o teu salario depende dos teus compa eiros
2643690 en dinamarca as condici ns que eu viv n sinala ant n cambiaron bastante e xa non o chollo que era
2643691 no 2003 o meu primeiro ano de xornaleiro recollendo maz s o meu salario foi de entre 1 800 e 2 400 euros por mes traballando cinco d as por semana eso s con xornadas de m is de 12 horas
2643692 eu desde o primeiro ano atopei traballo na industria do salm in xusto ao rematar a temporada da froita
2643693 un traballo duro e ben pagado que me permit u retornar a galicia con cartos para pagarme os meus estudos sen problemas
2643694 moi dif cil facer ver a un profesor universitario que non vas poder asistir s s as clases pero que che interesa seguir matriculado e continuar co curso a partir de xaneiro moitos non permiten que se faga
2643695 hay una apuesta para que sectores como el energ tico o el metal rgico crezcan en el futuro y creen empleo donde se pueden introducir profesionales de otros sectores mediante el plan de reorientaci n del empleo que hemos puesto en marcha desde la xunta
2643696 puede ser que en el futuro haya problemas en el empleo pero galicia tiene un colch n importante respecto a espa a y est resistiendo mejor la crisis
2643697 es un cambio de modelo en el que estamos trabajando y en esta legislatura hemos logrado rebajar el peso de la construcci n la afiliaci n a la seguridad social en este sector pas de significar el 12 a representar el 5 mientras en la industria se ha pasado de tener menos del 1 de los trabajadores a contar con un 7 5 lo que hace que est n mejor amortiguados los efectos del par n en la construcci n
2643698 porque son la base de la econom a gallega y hay que evitar que sufran en el futuro
2643699 ma i dont want to celebrate just for a day i want to celebrate everyday i dont want anything lavish i want something intimate and lots of conversation and not pleasantries
2643700 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2643701 fue una emoci n inmensa con muchos nervios todos nos pusimos a saltar como locos
2643702 es algo muy especial por ser la primera de toda la expedici n por ser un oro e hist rica porque nunca antes un ciclista espa ol la hab a conseguido
2643703 sab a que iba a estar peleando por alguna eso lo ten a claro viene de hacer un buen tour de francia fue s ptimo sab a que si llegaba hasta el final iba a tener muchas opciones
2643704 hablamos en la cadena ser un minutito recuerda y ahora hace un rato que estaba en la casa de espa a cenando con los pr ncipes y dem s temas del protocolo estaba muy contento
2643705 la gente no lo ve pero hay un gran trabajo y sacrificio detr s hay muchas horas el no poder salir como una pareja normal no poder ir a la playa con tus hijos cuidar la alimentaci n pero esto compensa con creces
2643706 lleg a estos juegos un poco tapado por nombres como valverde contador o sastre por ganar el tour
2643707 creo que a samuel este oro le sirve de reconocimiento a una gran trayectoria que lleva tambi n hizo podio en la vuelta a espa a y ha hecho cosas importantes aunque bajo la sombra de gente que ha ganado un tour o un giro pero si el seleccionador tiene que llevar s lo a cinco corredores pues est claro que eres uno m s y que por algo es
2643708 a ver como est pero supongo que no descartar nada va a ser complicado porque ha hecho mucho esfuerzo pero el oro seguro que le da muchos nimos
2643709 mi madre es gallega y mi abuela tambi n estoy muy unida a esta tierra desde siempre
2643710 lo tuvimos que posponer al llegar del tour pero creo que con este oro pasar igual
2643711 la princesa me pregunt que de d nde era le dije que de oviedo y as hablando descubrimos que somos parientes lejanos
2643712 im pretty happy with that it was a pretty emotional race
2643713 we were ready to leave the olympic games and we were waiting until very late for this decision
2643714 she told us we should stay in the best interest of the country
2643715 hes from the same background as us a man like zuma knows about suffering thabo mbeki has never been in a suffering situation he knows nothing about suffering
2643716 was not fair and jz is the man to recognise mk properly because he was a commander
2643717 anything is possible in a revolution and we will do everything necessary to ensure zuma does not go to jail but we must be civilised now and there cant be a situation where we lose our principles
2643718 the law is being bent for other people so why cant it be bent for someone with the majority behind him
2643719 if they are making a plan for sudanese president omar al bashir to not stand trial for war crimes in the international criminal court why cant they do the same for zuma
2643720 the judicial system in south africa is corrupt from a to z
2643721 zuma will hear the voice from the grass roots more than thabo mbeki local government is where the problem is because municipalities dont want to listen and learn and zuma will change this
2643722 all the members of the anc who were involved in corruption in the arms deal should be brought before court this should have happened in the first place the state has mishandled the whole thing that is why i am supporting zuma
2643723 he will tell people to start putting money with guys in my language white is a language indian is a language and they have all the money the xhosas have had the money opened up for them now it is the zulus turn
2643724 zuma is the only person who can lead the anc
2643725 the media have decided already that he is guilty so we must fight back
2643726 violence against women violates the rights and undermines the dignity of our sisters mothers and daughters it undermines our democratic victory it is contrary to the values of the constitution born of the blood shed by countless patriots including women
2643727 as we celebrate our women on this day we remember gail and many others whose lives were brutally snuffed out through unacceptable criminal violence
2643728 equally we would like to make an earnest appeal to community structures and in particular families to stand up against and report incidents of women and children abuse
2643729 the continued perpetration of these barbaric acts of gender violence is an indictment on all of us and should correctly make us angry even as it propels us to intensify our efforts to end this social malaise
2643730 while we have professional women who are realising their dreams most south african women still do not have enough resources to change their lives for the better
2643731 there is nothing sustainable about killing 40 of the remaining breeding bulls which is ignoring all the field research from us and the ministrys own officials
2643732 hunting will not have a serious effect on the elephant population but the combination of elephant hunting and problem animal control may especially in areas where there is little input from overflow out of etosha national park have a serious impact on male elephant populations
2643733 i think the ministry officials who approved these quotas are not thinking in terms of the best conservation measures for the keystone species in the kunene region but are succumbing to pressure from conservancies to earn quick bucks
2643734 larger loss of faith in institutions but keep in mind you know john edwards did not order that anyone be tortured he did not violate the geneva convention he did not forge a document to lead us into a war he cheated on his wife

2643749 i am pretty hard on myself thats what youve got to do to keep playing youve got to be your worst critic
2643750 i think im as good as if not better than the receivers that went ahead of me
2643751 what happened was i was crossing the street coming out of a club as i was crossing the street a guy i guess it was a drunk driver almost hit me with his truck i had to jump out of the way it escalated from there
2643752 if i left town for six months id let him move into my house and wouldnt worry about one thing
2643753 i lost a lot of friends to gun violence and things like that
2643754 the summer before my junior year at virginia tech i was home for six weeks and i lost a friend every week i was home
2643755 it was the first time id heard gunshots at virginia tech
2643756 they compared us to what the new orleans saints did for katrina victims
2643757 the games gave people a chance to get out and be happy it was so depressing after the shooting the whole campus was in shock everywhere you went people were crying
2643758 every time jerry rice went out he was getting wide open or making great catches crossing the middle

2643760 noo it needs some sliced bananas im finnuh brulee them watch this
2643761 remember its a long time until we play a game that counts
2643762 it wasnt by design for him to have so few attempts but we knew he was not going to play very much hell play more next week so hell throw more in general
2643763 the situation of the game coach felt like that was enough for me
2643764 i dont know yet that we can all of a sudden be a pass heavy team and throw the ball all over the place
2643765 theres no part of me right now that could tell you we would be able to change right now from where we were last year
2643766 anytime someone plays that well especially at that position it builds your confidence in him

2643790 overall i ran a little harder today and i hit a little more today as well
2643791 i didnt have any problems and i felt pretty good afterwards too its another step forward
2643792 well see how he feels as the afternoon progresses im not saying that well be able to use him im not saying were not
2643793 when hes ready hes ready i dont know i dont anticipate it being long term just hope its not as long as the finger
2643794 were looking at his efficiency the number of pitches per inning his velocity
2643795 things are going pretty well for him and i think thats where well leave it hes making a lot of progress but we dont want to get ahead of ourselves
2643796 hes progressing daily in a lot of ways and he needs to continue to make progress hes handled this well and learned a lot about himself
2643797 you cant simulate game speed swings or game speed check swings
2643798 i guess theres no better way to end the game than that with him basically saving the game
2643799 embarrassed over the situation and regretted having ever taken these photos
2643800 it seems like the first inning is the one that gives him the most trouble
2643801 his last few starts weve seen a lot of very good signs of him turning the corner his velocitys very good hes had much better action on his slider hes throwing the ball where he wants to most of the time
2643802 then hell have an inning or two where hell have a little bit of a setback
2643803 i told myself after the first inning my team needs me
2643804 i wanted to keep the ball down in the zone and let them get themselves out

2643810 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2643811 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2643812 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2643813 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2643814 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2643815 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2643816 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2643817 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2643818 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2643819 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2643820 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2643821 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2643822 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2643823 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2643824 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2643825 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2643826 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2643827 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2643828 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2643829 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2643830 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2643831 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2643832 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2643833 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2643834 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2643835 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2643836 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2643837 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2643838 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2643839 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2643840 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2643841 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2643842 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2643843 i should have known that people would feel that way
2643844 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2643845 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2643846 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2643847 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital

2643854 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2643855 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2643856 only one of us could make it over the wall
2643857 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2643858 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2643859 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2643860 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shoulda told him im a f in rock star

2643864 we spoke about doing an album it just was premature
2643865 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2643866 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2643867 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2643868 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2643869 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2643870 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2643871 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2643872 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2643873 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby

2643882 i have a computer and if i dont use it people will think im weird
2643883 the internet is so useful how will i get along without it
2643884 for almost five years florida power amp light trumpeted green energy saying customers could help the environment by contributing as little as 9 75 a month to buy renewable power
2643885 on tuesday angry state regulators killed the program by a unanimous vote after a public service commission staff
2643886 about 9 million in customers money had gone into a black hole where there is no transparency clearly this is not right
2643887 no reasonable person would have contributed to this program knowing that 80 percent of their money was not going to renewables
2643888 fpl spokesman mayco villafana is still touting the programs success saying the money was well spent because almost 40 000 floridians signed up to pay the extra 9 75 a month and marketing was key to drawing them in
2643889 thats preposterous like gloating about the cleverness of a scam
2643890 to do that fpl should acknowledge its error and pay full refunds to all donors who put their trust in a green earth gimmick
2643891 we think it is a sad state of affairs when upmc resorts to using babies as chattel in their desire to dominate the regions health care
2643892 if it werent for inflation people wouldnt mess around with all the volatility in the stock market
2643893 inflation is a compelling reason why clients would want to have a stock exposure in their portfolio depending on their age
2643894 they would want to have at least 30 percent in stocks to help minimize the effects of inflation
2643895 what investors should be worried about is what are the future expectations for future earnings
2643896 if companies are faced with higher input costs and cant pass it on profits shrink
2643897 for investors in the equity markets they need to think about which companies can grow their businesses in such an environment
2643898 who has pricing power foreign exposure and the ability to grow a business in a declining u s economy
2643899 it eats away at the purchasing power of the portfolio and as the fed raises rates it also decreases the value of the bonds a double whammy
2643900 also we try to keep maturities short on bonds so as they mature we buy bonds at higher rates
2643901 i expect inflation to continue because the fed is under pressure to keep interest rates low to combat the credit crisis
2643902 the demise of the dollar and why its great for your investments
2643903 society is addicted to easy credit at the personal consumption and banking level
2643904 the natural tendency is to inflate the currency and we expect that to continue for some time
2643905 they help protect you against inflation but the best inflation hedge is gold
2643906 were in one of those moments in time when you want to be out of the stock market and in cash
2643907 but not dollars gold should be your liquidity gold is money historically it has maintained its value over long periods of time
2643908 home prices are declining at a substantial rate and thats a big asset on everyones balance sheet
2643909 wages are significantly embedded in corporate costs wage growth is not inflationary but minimal at best
2643910 we are in a recession and that will lead to a decline in other high cost items such as gas and groceries
2643911 those prices will come down in the next six months without the fed taking any further action on interest rates
2643912 we think the way to hedge portfolios from the effects of inflation is to invest in carefully selected stocks
2643913 stocks have historically since 1925 averaged about 10 percent a year and that beats inflation over that time period by 3 5 percent
2643914 in the short term stocks may be volatile but in the long term they should provide the inflation hedge
2643915 the emotion behind money building wealth from the inside out
2643916 are the only thing shown to outpace inflation in the last 100 years
2643917 i think the long fifth inning might have got to him a little bit i think he had a better breaking ball and changeup than he had a fastball he pumped his fastball when he needed it and it had some life on it it was a good performance by him
2643918 his velocity isnt the same hes not quite back to where he was a couple of years ago but with what he has he is probably better than a lot of guys he is a force on the mound
2643919 he doesnt miss that bad that was at his face if you want to throw inside and knock a guy off you dont do it at his face they can say what they want to say
2643920 if it was intentional i was hoping for the ribs or lower we scored five runs after that whatever it did was a good thing for us
2643921 that one doesnt have anything to do with this one with us
2643922 all i know is my guy is hit after a leadoff triple you dont want to face a guy who hit a two run homer you can put it however you want to spin it and ill spin it my way the next ball is at my guys face
2643923 it should have been obvious to everyone that wasnt on purpose hes trying to get a fastball inside thats one of the pitches that got away
2643924 it didnt even cross my mind that he thought it was intentional until i saw him look at me it really shocked me i was just trying to make a good pitch on the inside corner
2643925 if you stick a hatpin in at boston and drive it through the center of the earth you come out very near the bay of islands the first europeans to go south of the equator expected to find a sort of looking glass world backwards but recognizable but even today there is something about the antipodes that makes one feel estranged as if time had stopped or begun reversing as if under a different heavens one were breathing a different air
2643926 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks ms henton said
2643927 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a us110 130 band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2643928 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand chatham house said in a gloomy report entitled the
2643929 given recent price experience a spike in excess of us200 per barrel is not infeasible
2643930 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend mr jessop said
2643931 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2643932 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three percent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2643933 ever accelerating demand for commodities from emerging economies could not be taken for granted
2643934 the trend among asian countries towards cutting fuel subsidies will increase the sensitivity of demand to higher global oil prices by ensuring that final consumers bear more of the cost
2643935 interesting to see if this trend continues in the next quarter which could prove highly ominous for the banks overall reputation

2643940 eight people were killed in our province mostly by landslides and flash flood he told afp adding that three more people were missing
2643941 we have warned people of the risk of more landslides
2643942 though the pool of writers has been shrinking for years the
2643943 i was always worried that a one newspaper town would do this to use national writers in emergency situations
2643944 i personally think there are too many issues that smack of conflict for us to continue
2643945 my sports editor hasnt decided but id guess hes leaning the same way
2643946 last year a customer who left with 8000 13 530 worth of purchases it was a basic sale this summer when we sell 3000 or 4000 worth were happy the sales assistant said
2643947 we have made fewer sales but for sums that were often very considerable one customer left with items worth more than 50 000 she said
2643948 yachts of more than 40 metres belonging to the super rich are still there but with the 15 to 35 metre yachts there is a very big drop in numbers said guy chevalier who runs a taxi boat service charging customers 80 a time to be ferried to and from their boats
2643949 we are easily at a third of last years business there are far fewer people coming to saint tropez just to anchor for the evening he said
2643950 this summer an average of 30 boats are anchored compared to some 60 in previous years he said
2643951 i have never seen this before our clients came here for a total break this year they are at their computers from 8 00 am said one worker at the four star yacca hotel
2643952 in four years its the first time that i have received this type of message unfortunately we are far from being full unlike last summer said an employee

2643966 its an interesting fact but theyre still doing an investigation
2643967 a lot of cases the locals know about the caves that the mss doesnt know about so theyre not counted on the registry
2643968 wed go out on landowners property and tell them we wanted to look at specific caves and they would often tell us they had other caves on their land that they dont think anyone else knew about
2643969 out of it they tell you the story of the caves too
2643970 almost everyones cave has some kind of story behind it
2643971 they joke that i can walk into the coffee shop in the middle of nowhere and introduce myself to three old men and walk out with 20 new caves
2643972 were totally convinced that well find the largest cave around
2643973 theres some locations where we know what to expect and are more optimistic about coming out with a number of new caves found in that area
2643974 id love for every cave to be the big one
2643975 usually though i am just happy to find a hole that i can get into that is more than 25 feet and doesnt make me wander around to find it
2643976 a lot of it is luck and having a good relationship with landowners so they tell other landowners youre ok to talk to
2643977 its the policy of mss to not distribute cave locations

2643990 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2643991 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2643992 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2643993 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2643994 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2643995 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2643996 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2643997 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago

2644052 im putting better than i was last year which is good
2644053 the only real difference that i might have kind of forgotten about last year was that it is 36 holes and its so important to stay patient just because i think its easy to get frustrated or worried but 36 holes is a lot of golf and really anything can happen im just going to make sure that i stay very patient
2644054 i didnt hit the ball as well as i have been at the beginning my driver was going a little left and the rough was just so thick that it kind of can be a little trickier

2644057 it was really weird but i guess it is what it is we couldnt change who i was playing

2644108 not being a geologist i cant get very technical but it just went kaboom
2644109 the middle of the arch just collapsed under its own weight it just happens
2644110 it could be 24 hours or 2 400 years its kind of a mystery well watch it for a while and will know soon with the middle missing the weight shifts and the remaining pieces will ultimately fall its a matter of how long
2644111 geology in action you hate to see those go down but it happens its a natural phenomenon
2644112 i am changing the plan well get to the bottom of this and well finally see a profit
2644113 what is it that i want to do with my life

2644115 what do i outsource what do i do first who will understand what is delayed
2644116 thinking can kill you procrastination indecision taking time to think about consider contemplate and re evaluate could kill you stop thinking do something pick up the phone get to work if you make a mistake forget about it do something else whatever you do take action
2644117 doctor doctor theres an invisible man in the waiting room
2644118 a nurse her name is joyce feels a presence in the waiting room she looks around but sees nothing she jumps up from her desk carefully replaces her chair and runs down the lavender hued hallway to the doctors office she knocks on the door no response hes not there where can he be she continues down the hall admiring a lithograph of an 18th century mississippi paddleboat along the way
2644119 she bursts into the exam room and says doctor doctor
2644120 a nurse rushes into an exam room and says uh let me start all over again
2644121 doctor doctor theres an invisible man in the waiting room
2644122 i was chatting with ben bernanke the other day you know ben dont you the fed chief anyway we were reviewing the feds policy on long term interest rates and he told me it had evolved into its current iteration only after a nurse rushed into an exam room and said doctor doctor theres hey where are you going
2644123 now i didnt get that i thought the doctor couldnt see him because he was with a patient
2644124 well yeah okay but the fact that the guy was invisible
2644125 when you say he was invisible does that mean his clothes were invisible too
2644126 loire atlantique en 1904 lancement du premier satellite am ricain autour de la lune en 1966 la t
2644127 i think more so than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark hes a huge part of who we are
2644128 im not the kind of guy who wants to cash it in and make a huge ridiculous contract
2644129 we have two of the best pitchers in baseball in our rotation
2644130 we have a lot of time to revisit webbs situation
2644131 danks is so laid back it doesnt seem like anything bothers him whereas floyd it seems like theres a little bit more that gets to him a bigger situation or bigger game might get him more nervous but danks isnt a guy i worry about
2644132 i dont think j d has aspirations of being the next rickey henderson but hes kind of doing it for the good of our team
2644133 i dont want him to hit first either but right now it gives us the best chance to win were just trying to get some guys on base for when the middle of the order comes up
2644134 it makes it sound like he didnt even have to campaign like he was running unopposed
2644135 i think that term sounds very disparaging regardless of who its applied to ive always thought of a free ride going to someone who grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth but here he had an opponent paul showen who could have possibly won
2644136 just say he won and say what the margin was dont make the language flowery because it sounds like bias
2644137 wwe and hall of famer ric flair have mutually agreed to contractually part ways
2644138 wwe and i parted on the best of terms this gives me the chance to pursue new opportunities corporate speaking engagements product sponsorships autograph shows for my loyal fans who made me what i am today and film and television roles my agent and i are very excited about what the future holds
2644139 i just cant leave the money on the table anymore
2644140 im 59 years old and ive never stood on own two feet without wrestling i need to find out if i can vince cant prop me up forever
2644141 everythings worked out great its awesome the offers ive gotten have been amazing my phone wont stop ringing
2644142 after handling his bookings for the past year and learning the wrestling industry im beginning to think the gillespie agency has a unique perspective
2644143 here we are a bunch of women booking the greatest most popular wrestler of all time we handle the multitude of tasks negotiate deals research the quality of the offer time out the appearances juggle his calendar we organize prioritize and make it all work organizing is just something most women are born with the ability to do after all we know that women rule the households right
2644144 ric respects our hard work and appreciates all the late nights we spend trying to keep opportunities rolling in
2644145 on the flip side we work so hard because we are in awe of his amazing ability to relate to everyone he has an incredible fan base and it would be easy to take that for granted but who knows the teenager who sends fan mail to ric now might be the marketing executive who hires him for his staffs motivational session 10 years from now
2644146 i want everybody in the world to know that i love and respect the wwe theyve helped me through so much of my life and have made me a better person they recognized me and my family at wrestlemania and have propped me up and helped me as long as they can
2644147 we are also very grateful for the time we had working closely with the wwe
2644148 the training that they provided us over the past year has given us insight into how the industry works and allows us to hit the ground running now
2644149 when i last spoke to ric in person we were in charlotte for smackdown and i spent several hours with naitch that lasted well into the middle of the evening early morning he had several family members with him and ric seemed really to be having fun rics schedule with the wwe had been somewhat ambitious in rics view as ric was one the road as much or more than he had been with his wrestling schedule in his later career nonetheless ric said he was having a great time as a goodwill ambassador for the wwe when we spoke
2644150 since the memorable hall of fame wrestlemania retirement weekend that really sent ric off in style flairs popularity is arguably at an all time high there is no doubt that ric can stay very busy over the next several months and earn significant money in the process
2644151 on a personal level and after knowing ric for parts of three decades i would submit that ric needs business structure in his life and hopefully his management team can provide that all important element it would be like my pals zz top handling all phases of their business including the financial end tax planning travel scheduling etc and still be expected to be on and perform as is expected of them secondly i hope that ric doesnt succumb to a big money offer to actually wrestle anyone who would pitch that idea doesnt have rics best interests at heart
2644152 i started this agency with nothing 25 years ago and the business has had ups and downs financially through the years but we always survived and i think thats because of a sound foundation of ethical business practices we arent in this to exploit ric we are here for the long haul and our goal is to carry ric from famous wrestler to famous celebrity
2644153 in may i wrote in my blog finally about how happy i was for ric that he could retire on a grand stage like wrestlemania with the love support and respect from the people around him
2644154 if ric asked for his release from wwe in order to pursue a career as a public corporate speaker i wish him the best ric is great in front of a crowd and if charm and charisma were publicly traded commodities on the new york stock exchange ric would be a walking fortune 500 company
2644155 but if ric is being driven by his sense of self and is contemplating a return to the ring as a result i fear that the special moment that was rics retirement and in many respects his legacy will be diluted forever in the process
2644156 ric sees that there is an immediate opportunity to brand himself to not only the wrestling community in a variety of ways but perhaps also to the corporate world as a spokesman the opportunities are apparently abundant at least for the time being for ric to use his reinvigorated name identity to his advantage and accumulate potentially a significant amount of money by essentially using the striking while the iron is hot theory
2644157 period end of story that also means not even as a tag team partner to his son reid who apparently has aspirations on becoming a pro wrestler i would rather see the young reid get an education before embarking on a challenging career in the wrestling business but thats just my story and will continue to stick with it
2644158 ric loves the social scene in any form and loves being the nature boy as much as any wrestler i have ever known has loved living their perceived tv persona
2644159 i have never been sure where the nature boy persona ends and richard fliehr begins and ive known ric for 25 years and have enjoyed every moment of it even though some all nighters with the naitch might have taken a year or two off my life or at least my liver lets hope not
2644160 rics approach to life is just like his approach to wrestling this guy goes all out
2644161 hes a 24 7 force of positive energy to be reckoned with
2644162 freddie prinze jr s passion energy and creativity make him an excellent fit for wwe
2644163 a behind the scenes role contributing to wwes weekly television and pay per view programs
2644164 i think hes probably just as qualified as everybody else up there that knows nothing about the art form of the business
2644165 i cant say much until after my contract expires which is sept 1 but at this point there is a good chance through mutual agreement that i will not be renewing the contract creatively the announcing job wasnt working out too well
2644166 we had the update this morning from them were obviously delighted and very much welcome the decision theyve taken today to continue here at the olympic games
2644167 last year a customer who left with 8 000 euros 12 200 dollars worth of purchases it was a basic sale this summer when we sell 3 000 or 4 000 euros 4 600 or 6 130 dollars worth were happy
2644168 we have made fewer sales but for sums that were often very considerable one customer left with items worth more than 50 000 euros 76 600 dollars
2644169 yachts of more than 40 metres 130 feet belonging to the super rich are still there but with the 15 to 35 metre 49 to 115 feet yachts there is a very big drop in numbers
2644170 we are easily at a third of last years business there are far fewer people coming to saint tropez just to anchor for the evening
2644171 this summer an average of 30 boats are anchored compared to some 60 in previous years
2644172 i have never seen this before our clients came here for a total break this year they are at their computers from 8 00 am
2644173 in four years its the first time that i have received this type of message unfortunately we are far from being full unlike last summer
2644174 people who have a lot of money are ready to spend but they have become more demanding over quality
2644175 when you spend 1 500 euros 2 300 dollars a day on a private beach you expect a high level of service in saint tropez however it has not always been the case
2644176 i fell off the horse against frank mir and tonight i got on that stallion and rode it out of town baby
2644177 football memorabilia has increased in popularity over the past several years game used football jerseys of ones favorite player is usually on the top of each collectors want list
2644178 since your items were only used in a practice scrimmage situation the value would be much less than that of a game used item your field jackets from the mid to late 1970s are worth 75 each a nice keepsake for any falcons fan
2644179 weve had a lot of people on the river this year has been good maybe because people dont want to drive very far
2644180 this is the most fun you will ever have in your life
2644181 thats because of its cold water and plentiful food sources the water is about 52 degrees year round shad minnows come through the generators of center hill dam also theres a huge insect population
2644182 people have to be mindful of what they take out and be mindful of keeping the river clean
2644183 we want to keep the river as it is not commercialize it
2644184 everyone else who comes to this river feels the same way we want it to stay quiet and pristine
2644185 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2644186 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2644187 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2644188 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2644189 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2644190 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2644191 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2644192 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2644193 the arguments in favour of appreciation pre date recent concerns over inflation simply put china cannot rebalance its economy with a severely undervalued currency we expect rapid appreciation to continue
2644194 the economy is decelerating sharply the correction in the construction sector is still ongoing and the outlook for the near to medium term is rather bleak
2644195 we believe the deterioration of spain is just in the beginning stages
2644196 the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
2644197 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
2644198 the almost recession is having an impact i suppose people are going out less than before
2644199 the ball hit him in the chest and hit the ground and everybody on the sideline kind of looked away
2644200 it didnt look good he carried us the last month and a half its a big hole to fill but were capable of filling it im just now starting to suck it up
2644201 i wanted to buy some berries a kilo used to cost four litas 1 16 euros 2 67 dollars but now its six
2644202 i always look out for cheaper stuff i hunt for special offers near where i live i cant go far because i have a bad leg i used to eat butter but it costs 15 litas a kilo so now i only eat margarine
2644203 i dont have a job on the side because of my health im nearly 80
2644204 the share of food fuel and heating in our budgets is much higher than in more developed countries and its precisely those goods whose prices have risen most
2644205 when consumption rises too suddenly that creates ideal conditions for price rises
2644206 but we shouldnt count on a rapid fall in inflation
2644207 my pension after a working life of over 30 years is 4 100 kroons 262 euros 405 dollars and i have to pay out around half of that for my two room apartment during the seven month heating season
2644208 life is not easy but i try to manage i choose what i buy carefully
2644209 its becoming harder to live when they say on the news that prices are going up yet again im not sad or angry im overcome by apathy
2644210 do i really want to play a game that comes with three discs
2644211 they cheered me on when i was doing something hard that i couldnt do and i got a new nick name
2644212 what are we teaching our children out of this whole ordeal
2644213 in a way that is the least burdensome administratively for employers
2644214 the first test for vice president is could he be president and rob portman passes that test with flying colors
2644215 he is very strong on domestic issues due to his experience and the different positions hes held and it certainly would help in ohio having an ohio vice president on the ticket
2644216 examined canadian and west african coastal data imagined where those sediments pooled before the continental drift then extrapolated to guesstimate whats off our atlantic coast today
2644217 resource estimates are highly dependent on the current knowledge base which has not been updated in 20 to 40 years for areas under congressional moratorium
2644218 overall impacts of exploration and production are reduced because fewer wells are required to develop the same amount of reserves
2644219 i would renew my request with the modification that the trigger be 10 a gallon at the pump
2644220 big oil is plowing these profits into stock buybacks instead of increasing production
2644221 puede que el acto no haya estado bien la manera de hacerlo no estuvo bien
2644222 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2644223 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2644224 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2644225 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2644226 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2644227 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it
2644228 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2644229 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2644230 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2644231 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2644232 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2644233 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2644234 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2644235 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2644236 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2644237 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2644238 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2644239 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2644240 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2644241 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2644242 calls on all political and social actors to ensure a peaceful climate throughout the electoral process and its aftermath
2644243 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2644244 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2644245 we make whatever the fuck we want deal with it
2644246 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2644247 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2644248 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2644249 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2644250 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2644251 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2644252 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2644253 i have always felt that a politician is to be judged by the animosities he excites among his opponents
2644254 oh but i am or was once a model blah blah blah blah blh
2644255 oh but i am or was once a model blah blah blah blah blh
2644256 hoy d a se levantan millones de corazones de los pueblos ind genas y revolucionarios del continente para acompa ar a bolivia en su proceso de liberaci n del imperio norteamericano y para decirle que saldremos victoriosos este domingo 10 de agosto

2644260 some meat and drink brother diverus bestow upon the poor
2644261 thourt none of my brothers lazarus that liest begging at my door no meat nor drink will i give thee nor bestow upon the poor
2644262 some meat some drink brother diverus for hunger starve i shall
2644263 thourt none of my brothers lazarus that liest begging at my gate no meat no drink will i give thee for jesus christ his sake
2644264 rise up rise up brother lazarus and go along with me for youve a place prepared in heaven to sit on an angels knee
2644265 rise up rise up brother diverus and come along with me there is a place provided in hell for wicked men like thee
2644266 give me one drop of water brother lazarus to quench my flaming thirst
2644267 o was i now but alive again the space of one half hour o that i had my peace again then the devil should have no power
2644268 its absolutely a critical time said don waller a uw madison professor of botany who has served in the past on the arboretum committee and stays abreast of issues
2644269 i remember thinking wow what are all these trees doing in the middle of the city meine said
2644270 this place is special because of the leopold connection and because it is the birthplace of restoration ecology
2644271 our idea in a nutshell is to reconstruct primarily for the use of the university a sample of original wisconsin a sample of what dane county looked like when our ancestors arrived here during the 1840s
2644272 our mission is to conserve and restore arboretum lands advance restoration ecology and foster the land ethic
2644273 are we a visitor center or are we a research and science facility or are we for public recreation
2644274 will be done for research rather than for amusement and for use by the university rather than for use by the town
2644275 my personal perspective is that people have been coming here for a long time and they are not going to go away
2644276 and in the tradition of the wisconsin idea it is our obligation to provide a diverse array of outreach programs from gardening classes to nature camps for kids its a way we can convey to people why we do what we do and that values of the natural world
2644277 is an admission that science does not yet know enough or is not yet sufficiently listened to to anticipate and prevent this process of wreckage which attends our supposedly advancing footsteps
2644278 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2644279 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2644280 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2644281 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2644282 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2644283 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2644284 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2644285 a fundamental challenge for it management in the move to a virtualized infrastructure is the configuring of applications
2644286 while server virtualization enables fast provisioning it does not dynamically configure applications todays businesses are looking for solutions that provision the application the code and the configuration information dynamically while also diminishing the time for such a process to take place
2644287 datasynapse provides valuable tools for optimizing your vmware investment and managing a virtual infrastructure
2644288 with fabricserver 2 6 applications can now be provisioned in minutes not days
2644289 fabricserver automates the run time deployment of virtual machines and vmware supported applications by providing the optimal architecture to manage application service levels with always responsive horizontal scalability and native high availability and disaster recovery
2644290 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2644291 the lake is changing faster than we can study it
2644292 we dont necessarily know all the impacts but we know enough to know that they are being catastrophic
2644293 the ecological balance of the great lakes is at a tipping point and the question is can they recover or can we act quickly enough to help them recover
2644294 now all the forage fish are way down in lake michigan and lake huron
2644295 theres a crisis the mussels are really messing up the food chain
2644296 theyre one half the size they were in the 1970s and 1980s
2644297 the first time that i dove in lake michigan i was shocked at the amount of biomass down there
2644298 wasnt native nearly everything i looked at was an invasive species in and of itself or was facilitated by one
2644299 la emisora difundir asimismo con claridad y con ah nco el concepto cristiano del matrimonio la familia y la sexualidad
2644300 nadie puede perder su trabajo por el mero hecho de ser homosexual
2644301 if theres any time to have a good person in this job its now because its going to take help from the department of commerce to help some of these communities recover from these job losses
2644302 the economy is struggling right now so its a great opportunity for someone to market the state as a great place to do business and build economic development in the state
2644303 i want to get someone with a background in economic development with a background in business development and who understands the economy and will be a cheerleader for wisconsin
2644304 because you have all kinds of financial disclosures you have to make and youre coming in after a bit of a mess
2644305 theyre worried about the timing of a lag at a time when we seem to be gaining momentum and we seem to be doing a better job
2644306 its a matter of gosh were making some headway here lets not lose that over some inappropriate expenses
2644307 we have not done enough to create the kind of balanced entrepreneurial economy to offset the kind of traditional problems wisconsin has had
2644308 experience shows both in the state of wisconsin and the rest of the country that tax cuts wont buy loyalty from corporations
2644309 if its someone with economic development experience itll be a plus
2644310 if its someone straight out of the business community there will be questions and red flags about whether they can make the transition to the public sector if its a political hire it would be seen as a joke
2644311 i can see print in my mind i picture white paper and black print
2644312 the first week my vision teacher said that schools going to be very nuts
2644313 things got extremely blurry i couldnt see my own fingers in front of my face
2644314 the trend is definitely students coming here for a couple years and going back to their local district
2644315 seventy percent of learning is visual and when you take that away youre always fighting harder
2644316 whether theyre complaints or concerns as a professional organization you shouldnt be afraid to document your shortcomings because they are a means of improvement
2644317 are normally communicated by various means to the extent necessary to handle them we do not maintain an index or log of such things
2644318 the center board shall review quarterly a report prepared by the director regarding the centers training plan and complaints concerning the centers operation
2644319 i dont think weve been presenting it as a comprehensive look at performance that quarter
2644320 one of the reasons we want to bring in a consultant is to see how we measure up and see if were following best practices
2644321 i just didnt want the mount horeb fire department and ems to be known as a whining group
2644322 i dont know that i have ever filed a complaint against the 911 center formally the reason for that may or may not be obvious but those are people we work with on a day to day basis
2644323 can be ambivalent to the issues and say nobody has said anything so far
2644324 so we dont want to be overly zealous in pointing out mistakes that others have made
2644325 it had happened in the past and we had mentioned it
2644326 i think they had thought they had taken care of it before but it didnt take
2644327 if youre interested in improving your service you take all the complaints
2644328 normally i dont like to make waves but this sort of thing has been happening far too often lately
2644329 i guess it time to log this as an official complaint so we can begin to track the frequency of any reoccurrences
2644330 it is rare that i ever encountered a situation serious enough to warrant filing an official complaint
2644331 in a quality assurance program that doesnt just mean you rely on complaints
2644332 the patterns of complaints are analyzed to see if they suggest any improvements to policy training equipment staffing etc
2644333 in some communities external citizen oversight bodies such as auditors review complaints and investigations for sufficiency and for wider ramifications
2644334 theres such an abundance of well brewed local beers that its a disincentive to home brewing
2644335 why did you do that thats not what we talked about
2644336 well ok when you stop knowing then well do it the other way

2644340 they even want to touch the constitution right its best that for people like these we take action against and the
2644341 hold patriotic and civilised concerts as well as organise history writing contests and historical exhibitions in conjunction with the 51st anniversary of the countrys independence
2644342 of all the times for this to happen what else on earth could possibly go wrong
2644343 ill make sure that im on the lookout next time for you
2644344 what are you staring at never seen a pair of tits before
2644345 there is no draft anymore the government has become clever in realising that by eliminating the draft they can eliminate the protest but despite that we have had more than 200 artists submit songs to the living with war website
2644346 neil was always going to release it in the highest quality there was when we started it we did not know what that quality would be but we now know it is blu ray
2644347 when you reach that part of the time line those movies will be there
2644348 when i first came up with the title it was from a place of pure frustration it seemed a futile thing to do you make a record and really whats the point its like milking a bee
2644349 when i first made the record i had been in a band for so long and i was always a drummer i never really contributed much melodically so it was important to me to do as much of that as i could
2644350 if holbrooke wants me dead and if he has such a long arm i want to know whether his long arm can reach me here
2644351 i was present when the deal was made in june 1996 holbrooke personally confirmed this to me waving a paper with the signed text of radovans decision
2644352 not to worry adding that their families were taken to safe locations and that they would be able to join them as soon as the transportation means were available the prisoners then started applauding and shouting cheerio
2644353 that russian forces in south ossetia also have a mission to protect civilians in the province most of whose residents hold russian passports
2644354 i have been very clear that i believe the best education policy for new hampshire is for the state to have the ability to direct more education aid to communities with greater needs that approach however is not allowed under the supreme courts education funding rulings
2644355 the state should provide a base amount of aid for every pupil but the revenue should not come so heavily from the property tax
2644356 i believe the money should follow the child and that each child should have the opportunity to be educated in the best environment possible this may be a charter school a home school or an alternative school the present financing system does not support these options
2644357 the funding increase with this new plan is similar to the funding increase for education that occurred in the last biennium which was funded by the growth in the education trust fund
2644358 i believe the state should raise money through an income tax with high deductibles such that everyone whose family income is 60 000 70 000 a year could expect to reduce property taxes on his her primary residence by at least 50 percent on a home valued up to about 200 000 the pledge has always forbidden legislators and governors from talking about any other method of paying for our schools its time to remove the gag and drop the pledge
2644359 the funding mechanism is based on inflated education costs due to a flawed definition of adequacy and differentiated aid we need to go back to the drawing board to redefine adequacy
2644360 a constitutional amendment that allowed the state to target aid to communities with greater needs could help us avoid this problem but unfortunately the legislature has not been willing to pass such an amendment
2644361 we have already tried the donor towns scam this created bitterness in those towns and was on its face unfair because some residents in donor towns are low and moderate income people

2644363 and youre also seeing a lot of health issues from kids not building a fort out back or playing on the stoop and their neighborhood
2644364 i think its responding to a number of anxieties out there
2644365 the next generation is the one thats going to make or break us as a planet
2644366 not one person ive ever talked to doesnt think this is a good idea
2644367 this is really a product of thousands of educators pushing congress to get at it
2644368 youre sitting at a desk in rows youre engaging a couple of your senses if you go outside you engage all your senses
2644369 its so important to look at the education of the child in terms of the environment
2644370 weve got this growing crisis on our hands where weve got these kids magnetized to the computer
2644371 this idea is really catching fire all over the country we want our parks to be not just parks but learning laboratories for kids
2644372 kids are lacking the time outside kids come to summer camp and they get a little free time outside to play and they dont know how to do it anymore
2644373 they and many legislators continue to focus on using the property tax as the only source of revenue
2644374 i have been very clear that i believe the best education policy for new hampshire is for the state to have the ability to direct more education aid to communities with greater needs that approach however is not allowed under the supreme courts education funding rulings
2644375 i believe the money should follow the child and that each child should have the opportunity to be educated in the best environment possible this may be a charter school a home school or an alternative school the present financing system does not support these options

2644380 a constitutional amendment that allowed the state to target aid to communities with greater needs could help us avoid this problem but unfortunately the legislature has not been willing to pass such an amendment
2644381 our goal should be to provide a base definition to ensure as a state that none of our schools fall below that and to encourage communities to invest in education over and above the state mandated programs

2644422 biggest celebrity in the world is ready to help your family
2644423 certain pass plays i knew i was in trouble because i knew i wasnt capable of throwing a 20 yard out if coach jon gruden called that play last year i wasnt able to manage it i was thinking of ways i was going to survive the game and at least move the team down the field somehow some way
2644424 i think it is another step but for some reason im not really as nervous for that as i was the first two days of practice
2644425 i feel like ive got my feet under me and ive definitely got my confidence back my timing and rhythm are back so i feel this will be easier
2644426 im sure ill be nervous but i think im more excited than anything right now
2644427 i cant think about it that way or i lose track of whats really going to go down he said im just going to focus on my part and however many drives i get just make the best of it
2644428 i got to do the two minute drill at the end of practice even doing the scout team stuff just getting out there and throwing
2644429 our main goal is to get the most detailed images and remote sensing data ever of the geologically active features on enceladus
2644430 from this data we may learn more about how eruptions tectonics and seismic activity alter the moons surface we will get an unprecedented high resolution view of the active area immediately following the closest approach
2644431 knowing the sizes of the particles their rates and what else is mixed in these jets can tell us a lot about whats happening inside the little moon
2644432 wed like to refine our numbers and see which fracture or stripe is hotter than the rest because these results can offer evidence one way or the other for the existence of liquid water as the engine that powers the plumes
2644433 i flew all but the first 18 of the m20s when they came off the line until i eventually got a helper who took some of the load after a few years i know for a fact that ive flown more than a million miles in mooney airplanes without ever leaving the confines of the airports air space
2644434 in the early days there werent a lot of people here those that were did a lot of different jobs when i started i think there were 35 employees three of us herb anderson kenny lupe and myself used to design improvements and come up with model changes for the airplanes on nights and weekends once we had something we thought would work wed bring in the draftsmen and have them draw it up and then wed build it and certify it
2644435 i was one of only 17 employees from 1970 1973 when we only had one person per department basically handling spare parts
2644436 and i remember a day in the when we reached the other extreme we hired our 1000th employee fern corey who worked with us in the fab shop in 1967 the press covered the event because it was such a big deal for a company in kerr county to have 1 000 employees back then we were turning out 3 airplanes a day
2644437 our high point was probably 1966 and 67 before hal rachal got the idea that he wanted to make mooney the biggest company in general aviation he went out and bought two bankrupt companies ted smiths aerostar and alon and another one that hadnt started up yet mitsubishi and proceeded to bankrupt mooney instead
2644438 ive never regretted staying at mooney the whole time its pretty much a family here and i hear people on my tours comment all the time on how people here have such a great attitude we take a lot of pride in our work because there is so much handwork on our airplanes that requires personal attention and its wonderful to work with so many individuals who can look at the airplanes we turn out and be proud that our products have such a great reputation mooneys have the strongest metal cabin structure and wing in the industry and thats a direct result of the attention that weve paid to our work when i consider the people and all ive experienced i dont see any reason to retire
2644439 im doing something i really enjoy so why should i quit doing it i have no desire to retire i certainly cant sit around and watch television all day
2644440 i get there early enough so that mooney operators in australia asia south africa and europe have someone they can reach when they call with a technical problem its what i want to be doing it keeps me going
2644441 this action proposes to continue the existing special training and experience requirements in special federal aviation regulation sfar no
2644442 one of the most genuine persons that i have had the pleasure of teaching a true aviation enthusiast
2644443 every u s and french airman who took part in this deployment is better for the experience
2644444 training with the french air force provided us the invaluable opportunity to learn from each others operational experience improve our combat skills and strengthen the bond of friendship between our great air forces and our great countries
2644445 the french visit provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen our social relationship and enhance future relations
2644446 there should be as many combined operations as possible before there are lessons learned in combat
2644447 in the last three years piper has moved forward on virtually every front from new product introductions to strong sales from strategic alliances to breaking into an entirely new segment with our all new piperjet we are a modern day american success story a company that relies on american workers to provide the next generation aircraft for the world

2644450 in the last three years piper has moved forward on virtually every front from new product introductions to strong sales from strategic alliances to breaking into an entirely new segment with our all new piperjet
2644451 we are a modern day american success story a company that relies on american workers to provide the next generation aircraft for the world
2644452 the piper matrix fills a niche in the market that hasnt been truly addressed until now to date our entire first year of production is sold out and market demand continues to be very strong at the same time deliveries of our flagship turboprop the piper meridian continue unabated with 20 aircraft for the first half of this year and an expected 53 deliveries in total for 2008 these deliveries have continued at the same strong levels as those in 2007
2644453 piper aircraft marks the beginning of a new era by literally taking flight into a whole new realm of large cabin luxury performance capability and single engine efficiencies with this major milestone in the piperjets development we are witnessing our future one that is built on a strong and lasting heritage and reputation for innovation and excellence
2644454 beyond our product successes we have rebounded from the problems the company faced after the hurricanes in 2004
2644455 its a tribute to our workforce and the commitment of the men and women of piper that we not only rebounded rapidly but have evolved into an even stronger company we are not only fully recovered from the hurricanes our headquarters is in the midst of major renovation and modernization moreover the hardening we put into place when we restored buildings after the hurricanes makes our current facilities stronger than ever capable of withstanding potential storms or hurricanes in the future while we are faced with many challenges in a tough market piper is delighted by its performance and works continuously to improve all aspects of the business
2644456 we have reached out and renewed relationships or formed new partnerships with some of the best companies within and outside our industry
2644457 we selected williams international to provide the powerplant for our new piperjet and the williams fj44 3ap engine is a perfect example of the attention to performance that we have designed into the piperjet
2644458 our previously announced business alliance with honda to collaborate on sales and service and to explore opportunities in engineering and other areas within general and business aviation continues strong
2644459 and we are seeing mutual advantage in a number of areas we also have signed a joint 32 million development agreement with the state of florida and indian river county our home community to expand the companys infrastructure capabilities and expertise
2644460 dad served in india as a methodist missionary from 1944 to retirement in 1977 when freedom came to india in 1947 the government asked him to serve on the committee that wrote the physical education syllabus for all of india

2644474 one thing has been driving me crazy about this drilling debate everyone seems to assume that if we drill for oil in the u s that we will get the oil and hence we wont be dependent on foreign oil anymore but we wont get anything exxon mobil will
2644475 the oil that comes from that drilling will not be u s property republicans arent suggesting we nationalize the oil companies are they it will be the property of whichever oil company got the rights to the contract they can then sell it to whoever they like and they will they will sell it on the world market so the chinese will have just as much access to the oil that comes out of the coast of florida as we will

2644490 i had a baby on the 26th of october and on the 25th november i did a lunchtime show in the national concert hall with the andrews sisters and i had to get back into my little red dress i had my child backstage i was bursting out over my frock i was thrilled with myself it was really nice to know that life has ultimately changed but actually i can go back to what i do because this is what i do
2644491 because its not the be all and end all anymore i have higher responsibilities in this world but at the same time it gives you another huge sense of responsibility because youve got to make it work if you have a little person totally depending on you
2644492 i was rehearsing here i had to go home get some food for my son make the food i had to collect him from the baby minder bring him back home get another baby minder to look after him for the evening get back in here for a rehearsal and then get in the car and go to the pavilion and do a show
2644493 there are so many of us who go im just not in that zone yet thats why i think its just a blessing that it did happen because i would never have known the joy and yknow im sure life would have pottered on just fine for me i would have found other things to do maybe done a new album
2644494 and yknow my father died when i was four and i grew up with my mum and i dont think i missed out at all nor do i think art will miss out at all
2644495 everything changes when you have a child you get angry with the world everything takes on a lot more meaning i would be a lot more conscientious about things than i was before im a lot more affected by stuff now i feel more responsible
2644496 having a child is the most amazing emotional rollercoaster you will ever go through i think and there are desperately low times and there are fantastic highs all in the space of 24 hours and that experience has been phenomenal to me and i actually cant wait to use it on something
2644497 i still havent come to terms with the fact that im doing it i really am taking it day to day i think if i actually thought about that id have a heart attack if i stopped to think about it
2644498 its really good to take a break and then come back because then you are much more equipped to give him the best of you you do lose a sense of yourself and thats why with the career ticking over you are still you have to be very much yourself you do rediscover your own personality and your own sense of worth
2644499 there will always be that holy god where is the money coming from after the end of september my family all have very structured jobs they cannot understand how i can cope with not knowing where the next job comes from but i think you learn to live with that when the sh t hits the fan you do what you have to do i used to work as a nurses aid in jamess ive worked in the dog track ive done a whole load of jobs whatever it takes to keep things going you learn from those experiences as well
2644500 there does come a time in your career when you can relax a little
2644501 in the sense that you think well ive got this far
2644502 if you are going to stay in this business you are going to have to do two things
2644503 you are going to have to be very patient because the type of roles that you will be right for wont come along for a long time so you are going to have to stick it out and the other thing is do your own thing because that will keep you in the business
2644504 it gives the business owner and the employees a better knowledge of the business and how to keep operations going so they can make better decisions whether a disaster occurs or not

2644512 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2644513 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2644514 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2644515 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2644516 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2644517 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2644518 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2644519 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2644520 the arguments in favour of appreciation pre date recent concerns over inflation simply put china cannot rebalance its economy with a severely undervalued currency we expect rapid appreciation to continue

2644542 our graduates are no longer just competing with other students in tuscarawas county or even ohio our graduates when they enter the job market or higher education even theyre competing globally so technology is a big part of the skills they need
2644543 to turn our students loose in the world without up to date technological skills would really do them a disservice in the job market and their personal lives
2644544 right away the teacher knows who needs intervention and whos ready to move on

2644565 this team being able to finish better whether its the fourth quarter or the end of the season is going to define this team
2644566 we turned the ball over and did everything we were not supposed to do
2644567 so i felt pretty funny after the game dealing with all our questions but i was proud of our defense throwing a shutout the first time out
2644568 to be anxious and excited or to realize just how much work we still have to do
2644569 because as a family the house was always full of music

2644583 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan

2644588 uc santa cruz may consider themselves an institution of higher education but they are also an institution of animal torture and killing
2644589 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age
2644590 the difficulty comes down to how do you measure improvement how do you quantify that so you have something you can track over time something you can use to identify gaps that have to be filled
2644591 every health department is different so where one may have strengths and they feel very confident in measuring something another may have that as a weakness and feel less confident

2644594 after the flood kangaroos bred from the ark passengers migrated to australia
2644595 that kangaroos are not mentioned in the genesis account of the flood either by name or description is unsurprising due to the great number of kinds of animals that were in the ararat area at the time whats a kangaroo or two among a great throng of pandas mastodons velociraptors and giraffes
2644596 its still debated whether these groups are monobaraminic or holobaraminic and it is one of project pterosaurs science goals to answer this question if we find specimens of both groups we can determine baraminicity by using intelligent design theory to measure their specified complexity and apply the dembski shannon equation to extrapolate the amount of relative informational loss due to genetic degradation from their perfect creation

2644657 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia
2644658 russian jet fighters have dropped three bombs on tbilisis airport
2644659 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are of course a crime and above all its a crime against their own people
2644660 thats because a mortal blow has been dealt to the territorial integrity of georgia itself therefore huge damage has been inflicted on its statehood
2644661 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2644662 i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2644663 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2644664 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2644665 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2644666 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2644667 the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate
2644668 may have been viewed as a green light for aggression in the region
2644669 russian jet fighters have dropped three bombs on tbilisis airport
2644670 there is no sign that anything has been stepped up as far as security is concerned but people are obviously nervous and concerned after the three loud explosions were reportedly heard
2644671 the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2644672 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on non use of force with south ossetians
2644673 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2644674 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2644675 civilians were hit very hard by these attacks allegedly targeting military facilities but not doing a very good job of it
2644676 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2644677 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate ceasefire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2644678 earlier today russian jet fighters bombed two villages in the upper part of the gorge
2644679 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2644680 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2644681 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2644682 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2644683 russia is saying that it is actually responding to a direct attack on its citizens and on its peace keepers in south ossetia

2644697 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2644698 russia is saying that it is actually responding to a direct attack on its citizens and on its peace keepers in south ossetia
2644699 this is a difficult legal situation here because techinically speaking south ossetia is in the territory of georgia so any big russian troop movement can be interpreted as an invasion of georgia
2644700 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2644701 there were no planes there their task was to damage the runway
2644702 according to some reports several russian ships are patrolling near the port of poti and are blocking ships from entering the port with grain and fuel supplies necessary for georgia
2644703 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2644704 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2644705 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2644706 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2644707 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2644708 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2644709 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2644710 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2644711 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2644712 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2644713 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2644714 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2644715 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2644716 should talk to the american people and talk to the world
2644717 i would be very direct with president putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2644718 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2644719 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2644720 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2644721 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory

2644733 the secretary general urges all parties to immediately end hostilities and to engage without delay in negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement
2644734 the secretary general believes that for the success of this endeavour all armed contingents which are not authorized by respective agreements on south ossetia should leave the zone of conflict
2644735 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2644736 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing

2644739 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2644740 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2644741 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings

2644746 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2644747 three bombs were dropped on a military airfield belonging to tbilaviastroi plant there were no casualties
2644748 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions georgia faces a humanitarian catastrophe
2644749 according to some reports several russian ships are patrolling near the port of poti and are blocking ships from entering the port with grain and fuel supplies necessary for georgia
2644750 we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement
2644751 it is clear that the conflict has now expanded in other areas than south ossetia we see a deteriorating situation in abkhazia
2644752 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2644753 the georgians must pull out of south ossetia and must agree to sign a document of non use of force in south ossetia
2644754 two thousand killed is it enough for you thirty thousand refugees is that enough for you

2644968 sampai saat ini pgiw su tetap pada pendiriannya yakni pgiw su meminta pihak nelson parapat dan kawan kawan yang mengambil dana christian centre rp5 miliar dari apbd anggaran 2007 agar mengembalikannya ke kas pemprov sumut karena itu hak pgiw su sesuai usulan dari awal pembahasan anggaran pembangunan christian centre juga harus dilaksanakan dibangun di kompleks kampus pgiw sumut dan kalau ada pihak lain yang ingin membantu pembangunan christian centre itu pgiw su yang mengakomodasinya pada panitia baru dan surat keputusannya harus dari pgiw sumut
2644969 pihak nelson parapat dkk yang mengambil dana rp5 miliar itu melakukan tindakan perbuatan yang mencatut nama pgiw su
2644970 kami mendukung pgiw su menuntaskan penyelesaian kasus pengambilan dana rp5 miliar dari apbd sumut oleh pihak pihak tak bertanggungjawab nelson parapat dkk yang mereka lakukan dengan cara cara merampas hak pgiw su yang harusnya mendapat dana itu
2644971 karena begitu transaparannya pencairan dana sangat mungkin keterlibatan oknum pejabat dan anggota dewan
2644972 masalah dana rp5 miliar kasus christian centre itu ujian bagi kajati sumut kajati harus menyelesaikan kasus ini ini harus menjadi perhatiannya supaya jangan sempat terjadi konflik horizontal antarumat kristen
2644973 uang itu masih utuh pembangunan christian centre itu belum dilakukan karena belum diperoleh lokasi yang tepat semula memang akan dibangun di komplek pgi medan namun ternyata di tempat itu akan dibangun kampus jadi kita masih mencari tempat lain
2644974 kami sudah menerima surat dari asisten pembinaan hukum dan sosial sekretariat daerah pemprov sumut sofyan nasution yang meminta pgiw sumut agar membuat proposal pencairan dana rp5 miliar untuk christian centre itu pada 5 juni lalu kami sudah menyampaikan proposal itu berkali kali tapi sampai saat ini belum direspon kapan dana itu dicairkan
2644975 namun karena dana itu tak kunjung cair pembangunan christian centre itu sedikit tersendat
2644976 kami sebagai umat kristen yang bergabung dalam puksu yang dinaungi pgi pesatuan gereja gereja di indonesia wilayah sumut merasa keberatan kalau uang yang seharusnya untuk pgiw sumut dalam rangka pembangunan christian centre diduga diambil pihak nelson parapat dan kawan kawan
2644977 ykksu berinisiatif mencairkan dana rp5 miliar dengan menjumpai asisten iv sofyan nasution atas saran asisten iv yang menyatakan pemprov sumut hanya dapat mencairkan dana tersebut apabila diminta oleh lembaga yang tepat yaitu panitia pembangunan christian centre maka kami membuatkan panitia pembangunan christian centre

2644979 sejak sabtu hingga hari ini minggu 3 2 masih terjadi gangguan penerbangan namun belum bisa saya pastikan berapa banyak penerbangan yang delay tertunda atau cancel batal
2644980 pada hari ini kita sudah menyurati direksi bank sumut untuk memblokir dana tersebut sampai ada proses penyelesaian hukum yang tetap dan administrasi yang benar dari lembaga yang berwenang untuk itu

2645055 jose is out for a little while maybe for a year those kind of injuries you dont know how youre going to come back hopefully he can pitch again
2645056 the worst part is it was very encouraging the way he was throwing the ball
2645057 it looked like he was back to where he needed to be he was healthy and his velocity was up and he had a good split
2645058 well continue to fight and its going to be interesting now weve got to look up theres one team in front of us
2645059 now hes confident hes attacking the zone it makes it a lot easier for us behind him
2645060 i didnt want to be responsible for our second loss in a row
2645061 i made some mistakes but i was able to hang in there and battle through i felt like i was able to pitch like myself a little bit today
2645062 we got into the situation off of logan where needed a big hit and we got it

2645065 but some people make me look bad some people make me look disappointed some people make me think about what we have some players should look themselves in the mirror and be embarrassed and they should be better thats all i can say
2645066 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2645067 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2645068 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2645069 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2645070 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2645071 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2645072 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2645073 there are a lot of guys here today and i want to thank them for coming

2645084 today 8 7 08 i was driving westbound in thai town on hollywood blvd the mercedes in the lane to my left unexpectedly swerved into my lane to avoid having to wait for a moment when the car ahead of her needed to make a left hand turn onto a side street not willing to wait for her lane to clear or for a break in traffic in my lane so she could safely change lanes to get around the car waiting to make the left she just swerved into my lane causing me to slam on my brakes and honk at her then for reasons known only to her she then slammed on her brakes again for no reason forcing me and the other cars behind me to stop again she also gave me the finger apparently for calling her out when i honked at her appalling driving i took her picture at the next red light
2645085 its been a pretty exciting career although i guess you always say that the most recent place youve worked has been the most exciting

2645089 love seeketh not itself to please nor for itself hath any care but for another gives its ease and builds a heaven in hells despair
2645090 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2645091 this race had been considered to be phelps toughest test but the american swimmer looked impressive all the way laszlo cseh of hungary took the silver in 4 06 16 while ryan lochte of the united states faded to third in 4 08 09 more than 4 seconds behind
2645092 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2645093 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2645094 hes not going to score 100 points and we hope to come close to scoring 100 points
2645095 i think you have to make sure that he doesnt dominate the game
2645096 upon receiving the recommendations of the iocs disciplinary commission the executive board has declared miss thanou ineligible to participate in the 2008 beijing olympic games
2645097 to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration that this case has brought the olympic movement very much into disrepute

2645099 oh but that dresser i picked up for a at the thrift store for 15 is 1 original mid century 2 sooooo much better made no veneer completely out of wood and 3 will last another 100 years
2645100 ah nice affordable knock off lamp but the lamps ive found for 5 in xyz thriftstores have soooooooo much character
2645101 last year a customer who left with 8000 13 530 worth of purchases it was a basic sale this summer when we sell 3000 or 4000 worth were happy the sales assistant said
2645102 we have made fewer sales but for sums that were often very considerable one customer left with items worth more than 50 000 she said
2645103 yachts of more than 40 metres belonging to the super rich are still there but with the 15 to 35 metre yachts there is a very big drop in numbers said guy chevalier who runs a taxi boat service charging customers 80 a time to be ferried to and from their boats
2645104 we are easily at a third of last years business there are far fewer people coming to saint tropez just to anchor for the evening he said
2645105 this summer an average of 30 boats are anchored compared to some 60 in previous years he said
2645106 i have never seen this before our clients came here for a total break this year they are at their computers from 8 00 am said one worker at the four star yacca hotel
2645107 in four years its the first time that i have received this type of message unfortunately we are far from being full unlike last summer said an employee
2645108 people who have a lot of money are ready to spend but they have become more demanding over quality added estate agent astrid michel
2645109 when you spend 1500 a day on a private beach you expect a high level of service in saint tropez however it has not always been the case she added
2645110 the singles were ground balls which isnt a big deal
2645111 i gave up a couple doubles but i felt like i made some good pitches i competed which is all that really matters
2645112 im just going to move on ive already done that
2645113 the most important thing for me is that you compete on the mound and that you give everything you have when you go out there
2645114 whether one guy is more media savvy than another i dont get too concerned about that its important that we know his heart not necessarily that everyone else does
2645115 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks ms henton said
2645116 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a us110 130 band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2645117 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand chatham house said in a gloomy report entitled the
2645118 given recent price experience a spike in excess of us200 per barrel is not infeasible
2645119 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend mr jessop said
2645120 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2645121 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three percent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2645122 ever accelerating demand for commodities from emerging economies could not be taken for granted
2645123 the trend among asian countries towards cutting fuel subsidies will increase the sensitivity of demand to higher global oil prices by ensuring that final consumers bear more of the cost
2645124 all those times goofing around in my front yard i always put myself here in angel stadium
2645125 it was my first start here but in my head id done it a million times i felt really comfortable out there
2645126 he didnt show it but im sure on the inside he was probably a little nervous
2645127 you cant ask for him to do anything more than he did he was outstanding
2645128 he probably could have played friday if he had to but i thought it made more sense to make sure it was right theres a lot of things you do on your legs as a catcher so i wanted to give him the extra time
2645129 i am fine my shoulder is fine honestly i didnt expect it to feel as good as it does
2645130 but right now my shoulder feels better than me i am struggling a little but i understand how the game works when you are hot you are hot when you are not you have to step back and try to figure out what you are doing and what you are not doing its frustrating
2645131 i have just been trying to work on my body recently
2645132 since i was hit in my knee i have had to back out from that and i need to get my conditioning back
2645133 it was our throw in and blanco was taking it
2645134 there was no discussion it was our ball and i tried to grab it away from blanco there was no cause for a yellow card i think its unfortunate on stotts part
2645135 i had both hands on the ball and he came in straight legged cleats showing
2645136 we had nothing left in the tank after tuesday superliga final it was always going to be a problem but we defended well and didnt give them too many clear shots on goal
2645137 then they usually say the best referees you never know theyre there i guess today you can turn that on its head and absolutely say what happened with the referee today produced the outcome of the game
2645138 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2645139 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2645140 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2645141 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2645142 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2645143 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2645144 obviously it wasnt the outcome we wanted for the season but we got together and came out and played hard for the fans the organization and ourselves as a team
2645145 we underachieved a little bit this year but this is a good building block for next year
2645146 i thought that second half showed what this team can do
2645147 we played a team game and we did all the things we should do well
2645148 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2645149 if you want to lie about me feel free you cannot lie about me any more than i have already lied myself
2645150 interesting to see if this trend continues in the next quarter which could prove highly ominous for the banks overall reputation
2645151 shock therapy to turn around its fortunes hiving off part of its troubled investment banking arm and cutting around 5500 jobs
2645152 we had 650 children involved in summer programs including story times and the summer reading program and a field trip to phipps conservatory
2645153 libraries traditionally see an increase in usage when the economy is bad
2645154 and if he was able to give financial support to a family who needed it he did
2645155 he didnt want to have to travel anymore he wanted to spend more time with us and give us a better life
2645156 it was a little bit of a rough ride for the first couple of years
2645157 it wasnt immediately successful we had a lot of lean years but i was just a little kid so i didnt know any better back then
2645158 whatever we were into and doing he was also very involved with
2645159 we had to delay start dates because we physically didnt have a seat for new employees
2645160 we have a great commitment to quality that you dont always see in bigger companies
2645161 people are not going to want to hear from me
2645162 they are going to say what does she want me to sign up for now
2645163 julie is a great person for the group as she is in the age range but most importantly she has great insight about business as well as being a true professional
2645164 she reacted with wonderful enthusiasm and cooperation julie was very excited about this new group and recognized the need
2645165 we want to take the focus off the less mundane networking aspect
2645166 if something positive business wise comes of it thats great but its not the emphasis
2645167 hopefully the group will help retain talented young people and promote getting involved in the community
2645168 i think a lot of young people want to get involved but they just dont know where to turn
2645169 i was 27 and it was scary to take the plunge
2645170 but its been great its nice to make your own decisions
2645171 its kind of nice having a block of time to myself i can recap the day and plan for the next one
2645172 the support from this community from the county commissioners has been overwhelming
2645173 i think it speaks to the excitement we have generated here
2645174 for the 18 year olds who want to go away and experience life this isnt the program for them
2645175 but half of our students are older and they arent interested in living on a college campus for them this provides the opportunity to earn a bachelors degree without ever having to leave the area
2645176 starting gate provides low or no rent options for business owners for at least a year
2645177 the only caveat is if you take advantage of this you have to set up shop in lawrence county
2645178 once we have this building in place we can then do what community colleges do well which is workforce development
2645179 in the next five to 10 years i expect this will be a fully developed college campus
2645180 if it was a drug store that went out of business we wouldnt investigate that
2645181 i think the call volume dropped so low they werent making any money
2645182 the powers that be whoever they are should give us some answers
2645183 there was never any defined leader maybe that was part of the problem
2645184 we were basically forced out of business there were greater forces at work against us
2645185 others have gone out of business but they always give us a plan
2645186 i didnt want to work a dead end minimum wage job
2645187 but without any skills thats what i was looking at doing
2645188 i really wanted to go to school but i didnt know how i was going to afford it
2645189 pretty much everything ive gotten except for the studying which i had to do on my own was through the keys program
2645190 our students are all on some type of public assistance so they cant get to school if they dont have gas for their cars or food or day care for their kids
2645191 the students need to have a service plan which is what i help them develop and they have to turn in paperwork to us every week to show they are meeting their requirements
2645192 we do help the student secure grants and loans to pay for it
2645193 this program really was a way for me to earn all my prerequisites
2645194 its been really great things i didnt know were available to me ive gotten through keys
2645195 that is definitely part of the problem getting the word out that this exists
2645196 thats why we really want to get the word out if you really want to go to school if you want a degree come see us
2645197 north strabane resident asks permission to erect wind turbine in yard
2645198 there is still a chance that we could have both grocery stores
2645199 we are not a full service grocery store but we are a full product grocery store and we offer very competitive prices especially in underserved communities
2645200 we should think about this as the long needed expansion and development of centre avenues business corridor
2645201 this is what the future of centre avenue should be
2645202 our goal is to encourage foot traffic that will bring about development in this area
2645203 i was born and raised in east liberty and i have seen how a grocery store can change a community look at what whole foods has done in east liberty
2645204 we are not whole foods but we have been operating in this region for many years now
2645205 10 or 15 years ago because this was a hard place
2645206 this was a chance to give people a sense of the decision we have to make and we are extremely excited that we even have a choice between two very good proposals
2645207 i did work as a professional actor after i got out of the marine corps in the 1970s
2645208 after i got married i kind of drifted away from it but kept my foot in the door for the next 30 years in amateur theater productions
2645209 when arthur saw me perform in the schools production of two gentlemen from verona he came up to me and said you are definitely an actor
2645210 he saw something in me and spent the next three years coaching me to this day i phone him once a week to discuss theater
2645211 people were telling me i had what it takes but the new york theater world is tough
2645212 thats why i decided to jump on my motorcycle and travel around the country looking for an acting job
2645213 i phoned the theater and told them id like to come to washington to try out
2645214 the tuesday after memorial day they granted me an audition the very next day they called back to say they wanted me to play the role of george
2645215 not only did she photograph someone at an event but her reflection is in the guys glasses as well
2645216 i just love that picture i really do it was purely accident to be honest with you
2645217 she told this story and that was something very different and we appreciated that as well
2645218 the pure joy in the little boys face really touched all the judges
2645219 he knew that i sent it in the mail for a contest and he kept asking me did i win a contest yet
2645220 whenever we got the phone call he was very excited about it
2645221 hell be known as the sheep boy for the rest of his life
2645222 it was taken last october my wife and i were biking along the north shore of moraine it was a nice day so i brought my camera along
2645223 i entered three this one wasnt my favorite one but they liked it
2645224 im happy that they do the contest its a great idea to promote the county
2645225 we felt that those three images really filled the bill as far as what we were asking people for
2645226 three boys in alameda park just having a grand time
2645227 we had fishing shots we got quite a few rodeo shots this year and a whole lot of kids playing which is wonderful
2645228 nossa fazerem isso com uma pobre crian a s podia dar no que deu

2645230 alguns homens roubam e matam sem nenhum objetivo definido querem apenas ver o circo pegar fogo
2645231 ive been waiting to see just how much hes going to involve the netroots in the way he thinks about policies
2645232 the netroots are not going away its only going to get bigger
2645233 the offensive line did an amazing job of blocking and letting me step my throws
2645234 the protection was pretty good i think we got run around maybe one time early and after that we really solidified on the edges
2645235 i know i need to work on tweaking my technique the game experience is the best thing for that
2645236 we moved the ball and i thought we had good communication they had a pretty basic front i thought this was a good start for us
2645237 the offense decided not to come to practice today were going to get this right
2645238 hes done a heck of a job i dont know if ive ever seen a guy get into playing shape as quickly as he has from where he was coming from
2645239 he worked hard he took a ton of reps he had a full body cramp on the steps right over here one day that was part of his process and he had a good game the other night
2645240 a lot of effort was put in by our office to receive more money for cpc but to no avail
2645241 unfortunately ceb neither increased nor decreased our budget last years events ended up over budget so we are actually starting the year with 10 000 less than last year to make up for it
2645242 because of the budget cuts and deficit from last year our programs must be cheaper and we will have to watch our spending much more
2645243 next year we will try again to get more funding from ut but if we cant we will be creative and find other ways to get our program funded
2645244 by cutting programs charging students for football games increasing tuition often and decreasing activities funding they are only hurting themselves i believe incoming students may be turned off by all the new fees and choose to go elsewhere and those that are here their ut spirit and morale are lessened
2645245 i think its just another setback student organizations are a vital part of campus and they allow students to connect with ut and personalize their experience
2645246 with little effort and no programming and preview the results in lightroom before publishing them to a site
2645247 hey ill just wash up these pants that smell like a dead body for casey my granddaughter has been missing for over a month and my daughter is in jail for maybe killing her this is the perfect time to wash these pants that were in the car that also smells like a dead body you know in case casey needs to wear them while shes in jail
2645248 i dont owe her anything i dont have to tell her shit she needs to learn im not going to be around all the time
2645249 tournament style vote off day 6 nfl qbs up now a smith vs b cryole pick the winner
2645250 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2645251 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2645252 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2645253 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2645254 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2645255 the akai mpd24 kicked ass in every round that mattered in this smack down 6 our of 8 ok its a bit more pricey than the trigger finger and it doesnt have as much software as either of the other two but its built like a tank and really has a pro feel to it
2645256 i think theres such a hunger for change and you saw that in how smoothly things went said gov deval patrick of massachusetts a platform committee co chair
2645257 require all states to conduct primaries to select their delegates to future national conventions
2645258 caucuses inherently disenfranchise the elderly disabled shift workers single parents and others whose circumstances prohibit participation in caucuses further the 2008 primaries illustrated that a caucus vote is worth more than a primary vote because each delegate elected by caucuses represents fewer votes than each delegate elected by primary
2645259 this is not about looking back its about looking forward
2645260 the amazing spirit of cooperation that he said committee officers and the obama campaign had exhibited in dealing with his concerns
2645261 democrats have learned that platform fights dont get you anywhere
2645262 it just makes me so sad said ms holmes norton
2645263 ive just been to a reception and a meeting and i didnt hear anyone mention it
2645264 a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2645265 this is the pinnacle of our protest for the 47 million americans without health care
2645266 we know what works social security works medicare works and we want to give everyone that under a single payer and control executive salaries profiteering waste and abuse
2645267 people are stunned that we go into debt for health care
2645268 a nadie le gusta estar en la banca pero son decisiones que uno tiene que respetar y cuando le toca entrar poner todo para hacer las cosas bien no s qu pase al regreso ser decisi n de benjam n si vuelve a la alineaci n anterior yo tengo que seguir trabajando para ganarme el lugar en el futuro
2645269 conseguir el resultado era lo m s importante el ganarle a un equipo de grupo y obtener esa ventaja moment nea todav a nos falta un poco m s de nivel creo que el equipo est para m s pero hay que seguir en el camino y poco a poco el futbol se ir soltando
2645270 lo m s importante a pesar de no jugar bien son los tres puntos antes de irnos a espa a ah tendremos la oportunidad de mostrarnos con equipos importantes habr que hacer un buen torneo all para regresar y meternos de nuevo en el torneo

2645300 who will be the scape goats of the coming jewish year
2645301 whos doing it one of you whos playing with time i knew chronos god i knew him you
2645302 im afraid you must be mistaken did you say you knew chronos
2645303 i knew a lot of people think theyre our gods their fine feasts
2645304 you understand how they control us dont you you see the truth dont you
2645305 theres a problem with time and the gods and they want me to go back to work im not going back to work you can work for them im done im through wheres my pension huh
2645306 never mind go its just an act of will is all it is to stay seated could you just spare some change
2645307 jesus damp white people this is why i cant own a dog anymore
2645308 it may not be of any use to you but if youre ever looking to buy or sell some unusual artifacts come over and well see what we can manage for you
2645309 thank you dont want to go back in though no though maybe selling it would be easier
2645310 why do you torment the working class with your indecision
2645311 is the proliferation of mass produced and inexpensive godhood among the capitalist class
2645312 hey wait you guys arent from cnn are you why are you interviewing me about crazy people
2645313 you know the enlisting of the homeless to sell newspapers is just the latest tactic of the consumocrat fatcats against the ecotopian resistance here in washington
2645314 hi this is vera im in indianapolis just got in thanks for the display cases i think were going to be able to move these things are looking up so stop moping see you next week bye
2645315 personally that doesnt suprise me most of this stuff looks like kitschy mass produced crap
2645316 i guess shell be back in a few minutes um is the shop still open its just about six oclock now
2645317 so i assume youre both here to talk to the proprietor as well fancy we take a look upstairs
2645318 i just hope she hasnt fallen ill or anything there were some pressing matters i wished to discuss with her
2645319 i came to ask ms che about something for a school project
2645320 indeed this would be a good place for school research beyond the modern pablum there are some fascinating artifacts here and there
2645321 er some sort of academic argument i dont recognize the names archaeology department at a university or something
2645322 miss che is supposedly a bit of a historian so i guess an academic rivalry isnt out of the question
2645323 well pantokrator was the name of the deity devised by newton at the end of the principia
2645324 it looks like shes fallen in with some rather heavy shit pardon my french
2645325 and from the tone of that letter i would say that a physical confrontation my have been imminent
2645326 i guess ill have to take your word for it but if youre concerned about her shouldnt we take a look into any other rooms before we go suspecting foul play
2645327 well i might if my organization accused me of corrupting its young men with my theories
2645328 are you alright alyssa that thing seemed to have it in for you
2645329 keep an eye out someone for more of those creepy crawlies and take a look at that print out too we have a mystery to solve
2645330 technological in nature perhaps due to the interference of extraterrestrials
2645331 miss che or lady genevieve was a lemurian her theories were becoming increasingly distressing to her lemurian comrades and that clockwork beast was probably sent by one of them left by one who was or is still here or is one of her own creations loosed possibly gone feral if shes dead or had to go into hiding elsewhere
2645332 what lies behind that heavy metal door is probably her workshop
2645333 think a creative anachronist with talents talents that given that you look at it didnt cause that clockwork beast to discombobulate im guessing you have as well along with myself and presumably ducky
2645334 sounds like it might be our friends laboratory hows about we throw this switch and see what happens
2645335 this this is no accident i think my lemurian grudge match hypothesis was right
2645336 it it wasnt the clockwork monster then that didnt have a gun that must have been one of her own things that escaped it was one of the other lemurians who murdered her
2645337 i believe the thing that attacked you was just an unfortunate invention of hers starved for mania
2645338 make sure you collect all of those schematics on the desk thats what i think they are anyway even if we cant haul off these things the drawings may prove invaluable
2645339 think of it like attention care your own je nais se pas
2645340 i hate the latent materialist in me but maybe i can rehabilitate you
2645341 the problem is how in creation are we going to move this thing back to my shop
2645342 well it would be a shame to let all these poor things starve but im afraid im not quite brilliant enough to feed them all if any of these interest you two i suggest cozying up to them straight off
2645343 well according to the notes the spider might use too much mania and by the way keep a look out for the two missing clockmen but the goggles do look interesting and its a shame about that bastardly suit of armor
2645344 i can always create more with the replication garden technique
2645345 i just hope its worth it this whole place gives me the creeps its like a tomb celebrating the deaths of things that were never alive in the first place
2645346 ah you may want to put that down now i think the greedy things had enough for one day
2645347 aha weve redomesticated the armor at least temporarily and i think if we release it that itll lead us to the pen spider thing that attacked alyssa and the missing clockman
2645348 hey this is weird you dont suppose he could mean next sunday like this weekend do you but the letter looks way old
2645349 as doomed as seattle is from all the shit thats poisoning it i dont think we can in good conscience let two potentially dangerous rogue wonders run about wild
2645350 i guess we could always try its probably not but it wouldnt do any harm ive been in the blue moon tavern before a couple of times when i was hanging out at the university computer science department
2645351 i think that the letter is probably old like it looks and that wu was the guy who introduced chen to the life sometime in the past
2645352 but i imagine we could get a trace of him around the blue moon even if thats so and there is no sunday meeting
2645353 if chen was a wu prodigy who went the way of lemuria then maybe he knows something about it
2645354 the guy is a bit of the mentoring type though not all that close to his pupils in my experience
2645355 or perhaps he was trying to wrest ms che from the grasp of the lemurians
2645356 um ill grab the papers from the other rooms and see if theres anything on the computer and then we can go after the er clockwork monster thingy
2645357 my main worry is that either he might of sent the letter from the past for a meeting this sunday in some weird temporal freakout or that if we find him he may himself turn out to have gone lemurian
2645358 alyssa do you want to look at that great big internet machination over there
2645359 too big to carry and even the designer said it was like totally buggy
2645360 regardless of the wu issue chens murder and the idea of a lemurian gang war in our streets theres a more pressing issue we need to track down the pen spider and the clockworkman but we cant very well follow a walking suit of armor through the city streets right
2645361 but with alyssas new goggles maybe it would be easier
2645362 you know at first i was feeling sorry for these hideous artificial things and then envious but now im worrying that adopting an orphan suit of armor is beyond my pay grade
2645363 im not sure im afraid we might have to bite the bullet and let it loose to get what we want from it
2645364 i suppose chen couldnt of programmed it to go wreaking havoc in public when its in working order like it now appears to be
2645365 at least wouldnt of or we would of heard about it right
2645366 what are the odds of the armor leading us to the clockworkman
2645367 oh geez its not school term or anything okay im heading home right now
2645368 guys um that was my sister reminding me i was supposed to be home ages ago so i got to go lets swap phone numbers and we can get together tomorrow

2645374 hes not an intellectual intellectuals start all the trouble in the world
2645375 if theres a fire on the block hell run out and help
2645376 mario huam n no ha sabido leer los resultados del fracasado paro nacional y se empe a en seguir utilizando a la cgtp con fines pol ticos creo que se est n alejando de la defensa de los derechos de los trabajadores parar promover sus intereses pol ticos
2645377 todo esto revela que la dirigencia de la cgtp ha puesto en segundo o tercer plano la defensa de los derechos laborales para buscar hacerse de un espacio pol tico posiblemente pensando postular junto a ollanta humala en las elecciones del 2011
2645378 esa es la raz n por la varias bases nos est n tocando las puertas para ingresar a la ctp porque sienten que sus intereses no est n siendo defendidos por la cgtp este jueves por ejemplo vamos a movilizarnos al ministerio de trabajo para reclamar por el pliego de construcci n civil

2645385 proclamation for the encouragement of piety and virtue and for the preventing of vice profaneness and immorality
2645386 compliance with a particular law presupposes a particular kind of civilization once that civilization morphs into something new old laws fall into disuse in short cultural mores dictate which laws pass and are obeyed and which laws are defeated or ignored there is a tendency on the part of many to overstate the importance of politics in shaping culture

2645390 never never will we desist till we have wiped away this scandal from the christian name released ourselves from the load of guilt under which we at present labour and extinguished every trace of this bloody traffic of which our posterity looking back to the history of these enlightened times will scarce believe that it has been suffered to exist so long a disgrace and dishonor to this country

2645392 it is important that we work to ensure that as many voters as possible have the opportunity to participate in a conversation about the challenges facing western new york and the country and the solutions we offer
2645393 these will be great opportunities for us to communicate with voters however these forums will not provide most district voters with the opportunity to directly ask questions of the candidates
2645394 time is running short but i believe strongly that the additional public debates i propose are the best way to make clear where each of us stands on the economy healthcare the environment the war education and other issues of concern to the voters of the 26th
2645395 dramatically increase the number of americans learning speaking and teaching critical need foreign languages foreign language skills are essential to engaging foreign governments and peoples especially in critical world regions to promote understanding convey respect for other cultures and encourage reform these skills are also fundamental to the economic competitiveness and security interests of the nation
2645396 this book opened my heart i felt so close to these people they are like my relatives this has been my favorite book it covers the gamut of human experience there are moments of such courage
2645397 and miriam is very special she has a way of getting us involved i dont know of any other group like this she talks about the authors life and other books thats something extra
2645398 i have been in other book clubs but rinc n literario is special
2645399 and i think a lot of it has to do with miriam she has such a love of books and learning
2645400 as far as i know this is the only bilingual book club in north county
2645401 there is a lot of empathy and understanding in the group
2645402 maybe i inherited that piece of me from my father

2645411 i played a great first shot then a perfect 9 iron for 140 yards
2645412 it bounced in the front of the green but the wind blows just in the moment and it went down into the water
2645413 then again i had tried to make a good shot but again a lot of backspin again to the water and after that i got mad and played not very concentrated the whole rest of the round
2645414 i was almost fighting for the lead in the tournament and suddenly i was trying to make the cut
2645415 with the launch of at amp t u verse tv wichita customers are finally getting a better choice to break free from cable
2645416 and were taking it even further by making your services work together and offering cool features you cant get anywhere else
2645417 i am pleased to see more investment in wichitas telecom infrastructure especially when it provides more consumer choices
2645418 consumers will benefit from these advanced services and the wichita area will be an even more attractive place to live and work
2645419 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2645420 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world

2645424 i am proud of my military dad because he fights for freedom and not for war he is like a thick plate of armor protecting us he is like a very bright night sic
2645425 my dad can do 45 sit ups in one minute and thirty one push ups in one minute he can run 2 miles in 5 minutes
2645426 my dad has been to iraq and afghanistan he says it is not that cool he was a navy seal he traveled to malaysia and he ate monkey brains i think he is very brave
2645427 my father does not like to be called a hero he feels that the people who died on september 11 2001 and all the soldiers who have died in this current war are the true heroes of todays society
2645428 my dad is a life saver and a heart breaker he is mighty my daddy is a fighter he is always in my heart my dad goes to iraq and stands up to the battle
2645429 being in the marines has made an impact in my moms life
2645430 right now my dad is not here he is in iraq hopefully he gets back safe if he didnt i will know what happened he turned in his gun and his uniform and everything else for those beloved holy beautiful white wings of heaven
2645431 i would not give up my dad for anything not even a mountain of gold

2645433 the water was deep green going into blue impossibly beautiful
2645434 we went to one place that had an open kitchen using wood fires they were cooking different things for us to taste two old ladies were making gnocchi a potato dumpling they were dropping the dumplings into boiling water when they floated to the top they were cooked and you could eat them with pesto sauce

2645436 im a food expert and i didnt know virgin olive oil is picked and pressed
2645437 you eat outdoors at a table with an umbrella facing the water its idyllic greek food is wonderful very strong and vivid flavors yet very simple
2645438 service on the boat was unbelievable it was really nice
2645439 mother you had me but i never had you i wanted you you didnt want me
2645440 its going to take a lot of hard work from everyone on the team
2645441 that win at sonoma wasnt easy at all once the green flag falls youve just got to stick to your strategy and hope everything works out in your favor
2645442 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got
2645443 whether we win or whether we run out of gas just doesnt matter at this point weve got to win
2645444 its important especially for the first two or three races of the chase when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at
2645445 it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2645446 not just a book but a guide that every mom should keep on her shelf
2645447 an author who is hiding in the great smoky mountains
2645448 its been three years and we have hundreds of lots i honestly dont recall
2645449 mr ross did not contact or ask me to change anything
2645450 while researching his renkels complaint it became apparent that there was a lack of consistency in appraisals among identical often adjacent lots
2645451 the lower appraisals were on those lots still owned at the time by the developer
2645452 this is a mass appraisal program and all values are based on sales information collected during the years between appraisals as the assessor of property from 1980 to 2006 i strived to be fair and equal to all property owners
2645453 there was no supporting documentation for the reversals no record of appeals to the board of equalization and no sales data to support the lower valuations
2645454 i am sorry mr jenkins spent so much time researching this matter when a simple phone call would have answered these questions
2645455 it sounds as if the person who did it was using the practice of developer discounting
2645456 the state board of equalization has determined that there is nothing in the law that allows developer discounting
2645457 the law states that all property is to be taxed at fair market value
2645458 that money is not recoverable and that portion of the tax burden had to be redistributed among the rest of loudon countys taxpayers
2645459 im very glad mr jenkins investigated the way i look at it it should be illegal i think somebody should pay
2645460 as people live in communion with the father they enter more and more into communion with one another they open their hearts to the smallest and the weakest being in communion with the smallest and the weakest their hearts are touched and the waters of compassion flow forth in this way they enter more deeply into communion with the father

2645462 soap is so high in alkaline that its going to dry out your head
2645463 the best thing to do is create balance by using a moisturizing shampoo or body wash
2645464 i dont want to sound cavalier about losing that admission income
2645465 but in the big picture i think it was costing us more than we were getting
2645466 i want people to feel like this is their institution
2645467 i think they will feel more that way if not asked to play a toll when they come in the door
2645468 i would like to be like the public library where you can come in at anytime and dip in for five minutes or an hour without having to put money on the table
2645469 you have to do a hundred different small things in the right order
2645470 a much denser and richer experience than it used to be we have a lot of variety on three floors we used to be a bit more monochromatic
2645471 miles de familias destrozadas por la guerra tienen al menos la esperanza de que les podamos asegurar que su ser querido est all enterrado
2645472 resulta imposible que se puedan encontrar v nculos familiares a todos los restos es preciso que la poblaci n nos d los m ximos datos posibles sobre c mo eran los desaparecidos sus rasgos f sicos o si por ejemplo ten an alguna fractura
2645473 resulta preciso que nos den referencias sobre el lugar en el que creen que sus allegados fueron enterrados por los militares
2645474 lo primero que hay que hacer es separar los huesos encontrados por grupos de edad y despu s por sexo
2645475 a las once de la ma ana m s o menos he terminado con las 400 me las llevo al r o para que se refresquen y luego las dejo por la tarde pastando hacia las diez de la noche ellas mismas saben que tienen que volver y regresan solas
2645476 muchos d as las carreteras estaban cortadas por la nieve y hab a que conducir el coche con cadenas
2645477 pas bamos ocho horas inclinados sacando la leche cabra por cabra
2645478 es para saber a qui n corresponden los an lisis de sangre
2645479 es una labor muy dura muy solitaria y no compensa es s lo para quien realmente lo disfrute
2645480 cuando vamos a granada lo pasa mal no le gusta la ciudad
2645481 ha sido ella la que ha tenido la idea de la ducha
2645482 hasta ahora ten amos que arregl rnosla como pod amos
2645483 esto es muy sacrificado dejar las cabras un d a supone perder mucho dinero
2645484 no creo que nuestros hijos contin en con esta labor y somos ya muy pocos los que quedamos
2645485 dice cosas ese loco que no suenan a cordura pero a locura tampoco
2645486 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
2645487 energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
2645488 at least i know she wont run off with the bloke next door
2645489 i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience
2645490 voters may reject you because they feel youre too old to be president
2645491 to fool some of the people all of the time
2645492 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech that he gave in 2002
2645493 hillary clinton was making a strong and valid argument for why john mccain will be the next president
2645494 in this case we couldnt have said it better ourselves
2645495 we are 18 million voices dedicated to seeing senator clinton reach the next milestone the white house
2645496 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2645497 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
2645498 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
2645499 the brainwashing of the american investor the book that wall street does not want you to read

2645516 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2645517 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman that we could all identify with
2645518 from the beginning i said if we could finish 500 in the elite league it would be a successful year
2645519 this showed the kids what they can do in the elite league it doesnt get much better as far as competition in this area
2645520 they got to see where they need to be to win this tournament a lot of teams in the elite league were pretty close to that level
2645521 some of the other coaches might seriously think about it now especially if they are tied into a high school
2645522 this is a pretty unusual group of kids the core players have been together since they were young they have kind of stuck together and not gone their separate ways what they did this summer speaks highly for next season
2645523 these kids are tested and they are not going to face anyone tougher than what they saw this summer they were playing against the best kids in the area and it just gives them more confidence as they go into their senior year
2645524 during the kiski game i hadnt really hit in a while and we were short on players so they threw me in the lineup
2645525 i took a couple extra cuts in batting practice that day and i had a big day at the plate
2645526 i kind of thought it was time for me to step up and prove what i could do especially with not playing on the high school varsity last year coming off that injury bursitis in his elbow this gave me a chance to step up and show people that i can play at this level
2645527 out of everybody crazy mike was not the biggest surprise but his accomplishment was just unbelievable
2645528 he was able to pitch complete games in championship games he was a young kid pitching in big games
2645529 we are real proud that we went as far as we did getting past all the local teams
2645530 with na being a huge rival if we didnt win that na game it wouldnt be a sour note but we put a little asterisk by it that we beat na to get to the championship game in their home park they love to beat us and we love to beat them
2645531 its all good competition and its only going to make those high school games better when we get to spring time we want those rivalries
2645532 we were trying to find a leadoff hitter and i think we found one when we beat youngstown with steve
2645533 he was swinging at good pitches and was working the count i wish i would have figured that out earlier
2645534 our catcher brendan scioscia called good games throughout the tournament to pitch as many complete games as we did you know brendan did a great job calling the game
2645535 i had been out of coaching for a few years and it was real enjoyable for me when you put together boys who dont play together everyday and watch them mold as a team
2645536 these guys accept each other they like each other and we came together as a unit and enjoyed playing ball together
2645537 i guess im an offensive defenseman but i can play defense at the same time
2645538 i like to make sure my own end is taken care of first before worrying about anything else
2645539 were looking for him to be a good solid two way defenseman
2645540 hes a guy who goes back and makes a good first pass and can contribute some offense
2645541 we like the fact he led the league in scoring among defensemen were hoping to get more offense out of our defense and josh is a big part of that
2645542 it helped a lot that im a local guy who grew up about 45 minutes away from rmu i played junior hockey 10 hours away from home so i was looking to go to a school closer to home it was the right fit academically as well thats why i chose robert morris
2645543 you could see he wanted to be successful he had it in his plans a lot of kids want to be good hockey players but a lot of them dont want to follow through and do the extra work you need to do to be a division i player you could see right away that he had that work ethic
2645544 it helps out having some local guys kids with whom weve grown up playing hockey
2645545 the younger guys they see all the guys from pittsburgh playing locally at a high level
2645546 i think having local people shows a commitment to youth hockey in the area gives kids something to strive for to play at the next level
2645547 i think once you get one kid it kind of creates a pipeline
2645548 having a very good local player helps in getting other very good local players
2645549 once you live here its in your blood i think
2645550 he can go get the ball in the outfield hes a plus defender
2645551 he was very significant last year in helping the club throughout the season and into the playoffs and world series hes a good ballplayer
2645552 its one of those things where you draw on the experience hoping its a positive experience or even if its a negative you learn from it
2645553 but im just trying to fill the role they need and move forward
2645554 any time you get an opportunity to play up here and help the team youve got to take the bull by the horns this was the reason i played to get the opportunity to play in the big leagues
2645555 we like cory cory has been a starter and hes been a bench player a role player
2645556 i think hes become more comfortable in his game and hes a much more complete and smart offensive player now he wants to play every day but hes understanding his role here hes become a professional
2645557 my formative years were here i met all my friends all through high school im still good friends with all of them
2645558 yesterday i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2645559 im just very embarrassed very disappointed in myself that i completely forgot how to play golf
2645560 the ryder cup is over for me thats how i look at it
2645561 the fast pitch game itself is as close to baseball as youll get
2645562 in fast pitch you have stealing and bunting and people will strike out slow pitch doesnt have anything like that
2645563 that side of the state has some very very good teams and players
2645564 i still like doing it i dont mind a little bit of travel
2645565 otherwise i wouldnt be sitting here with a heating pad on my arm if it wasnt that fun
2645566 its not a skill that is easy to just pick up in a short period of time sometimes younger guys start messing around with pitching but they take their lumps early on lose a lot of games and get discouraged
2645567 in slow pitch basically anybody can play anybody can get a hit
2645568 you almost have to have some sort of strong baseball background growing up to play fast pitch you rarely get the 14 12 games you get in slow pitch
2645569 when you get a runner on you have to move him up its a more pure baseball type game
2645570 the only noise i heard was somebody getting hit by a golf ball and they were grunts
2645571 this tournament is not going to be won by 1 under par
2645572 its such a tough golf course that they dont need to trick it up
2645573 the fairways are running 30 to 40 yards the greens are like concrete its not enjoyable to play theyve taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap
2645574 if we had it like this once a year ok
2645575 but it seems like we have this 15 times a year
2645576 nothing is ever going to get as tough as royal birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
2645577 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet
2645578 the only way to keep it on the green is to hit 75 feet away
2645579 we are not used to seeing this kind of major at a pga championship
2645580 but its still a major so youve got to realize it and just keep playing hard and hopefully youll be there on sunday
2645581 this is my third year now and im getting better each day im making progress and feeling more and more comfortable each day so thats a part of the process feeling more comfortable ive just got a lot more improving to do and a lot more things to work on
2645582 its helped me a lot but we cant really tell yet because we havent played a real game
2645583 so the offseason work will show late in the season when i feel like im still healthy thats when the offseason work really plays a part
2645584 i want to go out there and be my best
2645585 i want to go out there and complete every pass make the right decisions its like home training throwing to one of my home teammates i want to be perfect i try to get my mind set
2645586 yeah i always had the confidence but just by going out there and doing it and getting more repetitions the more you do it the more and more confidence you get
2645587 i just wanted to come here healthy and work on getting my burst of quickness back and making sure im healthy enough to play 15 games
2645588 it really didnt matter to me honestly whether it was over or not
2645589 it didnt have anything to do with me really i was just preparing just trying to see what was going on
2645590 yeah i followed it because im a sports guy i love sports i watch sports all the time so it was just me watching just like everyone else
2645591 if he would have came in they would have brought him in for a reason and i understand that but it wasnt going to stop me from doing what i was set to do go out work hard and try to get better each day that was my focus and thats still my focus so it really didnt matter to me either way
2645592 it could have been a positive or a negative i could have learned a lot from him hes a great player
2645593 this is a completely different team than last year and i like the idea of them picking us where they have
2645594 this is more me than basketball basketball was a time in my life this is my roots basketball was a little drop in my life that is why it was so easy to turn the page
2645595 it shows that the little guy can outwit the bigger guy
2645596 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2645597 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman that we could all identify with
2645598 often young students tell me they want to make a splash
2645599 ill say well let me tell you what john chapman told me
2645600 he expected you to engage in intellectual conversation with him hed give you a list of books and ask you to tell him what you thought about them
2645601 he always made you feel you had something important to say
2645602 but he felt that with the war over what was the point of continuing to put his people in danger
2645603 and if he was able to give financial support to a family who needed it he did
2645604 he didnt want to have to travel anymore he wanted to spend more time with us and give us a better life
2645605 it was a little bit of a rough ride for the first couple of years
2645606 it wasnt immediately successful we had a lot of lean years but i was just a little kid so i didnt know any better back then
2645607 whatever we were into and doing he was also very involved with
2645608 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2645609 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2645610 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2645611 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2645612 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2645613 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2645614 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2645615 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2645616 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2645617 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it

2645624 on the plan ride over i was kind of thumbing through it looking through it just trying to remember it
2645625 one thing we have to get straight is this chad thing
2645626 were going to have to call him rook or call me c p or something
2645627 i dont know he looks a little thin he needs to eat some chicken wings or something
2645628 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom
2645629 its going to be a lot of fun im looking forward to it i really do
2645630 i dont have revenge on my mind or anything like that i have one thing on my mind and thats a victory period
2645631 i think when youre in this business you know that things can happen anytime
2645632 being in it now this being my second year ive seen things happen throughout the season the last year where hey its just the way this business goes its the nfl and you have to be ready to live with whatever happens it went down

2645638 i keep telling general manager kenny williams we got what we need
2645639 but some people make me look bad some people make me look disappointed some people make me think about what we have some players should look themselves in the mirror and be embarrassed and they should be better thats all i can say
2645640 i feel like i might start pressing a little bit and try to make a pitch better than i need to
2645641 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is also a fabulous woman
2645642 bachmans is in the business of helping families express their sentiments in times of joy and in times of sorrow
2645643 we are simply overwhelmed with the gratitude and the outpouring of sympathy and well wishes from all over the world the calls and e mails were receiving are from peoples hearts and they speak so well of this extraordinary man
2645644 certainly a steady hand and a calm hand at the wheel at all time
2645645 i can only offer the deepest shock and sorrow we all feel here because the bachman family was always so close to our program
2645646 they still came back to support her former high school teams
2645647 it was just a great great couple supporting the programs and supporting the school
2645648 he never wanted to be above anybody their comments were always positive it never appeared to me in all these years ive known him that he was above anybody else i never got that kind of impression they were great human beings
2645649 he was just so incredibly supportive as a father of an athlete some people can get a little worked up at sporting events but he was just there in the stands waving his flag whether it was for team usa for ucla or for lakeville
2645650 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe
2645651 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2645652 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2645653 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it
2645654 we have to set the table for the big guys
2645655 hes thrown the ball very well since weve used him
2645656 i think it might be some kind of muscle spasm or something
2645657 i couldnt breathe so well see how it feels tomorrow morning
2645658 hes given us a lot of quality starts without much to show for it

2645721 mam i dont really care im doing my job and im not stupid comcast will not allow two different accounts at the same address so i already know you are blatantly lying to me
2645722 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2645723 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2645724 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2645725 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2645726 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2645727 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2645728 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2645729 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2645730 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2645731 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2645732 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad

2645734 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree

2645736 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2645737 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2645738 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2645739 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield

2645746 i have no idea why they did it and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the app store

2645752 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2645753 at 50 years old he will be sorely missed and to be such a good father to your kids and to be a great husband and not be around is really difficult for everybody as comics we are all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
2645754 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2645755 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
2645756 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2645757 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
2645758 when i showed up to work he said something to me that had never been said to me on a set before he said baby girl the script here is not the bible do you and ill follow i got mine you get yours when he said that i knew everything was going to be all right i was happy to have the freedom to make up some funny with him it was simply delicious
2645759 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2645760 exterminar a los indios salvajes y barbaros de la patagonia
2645761 that and a little ab work and free weights are what i always do for exercise on cruises at home i go to the gym every other day but i have to work harder here because i eat more
2645762 besides an early workout really gets you going in the morning
2645763 we are more into helping people change their lifestyles than ever before the way they eat and exercise and think cleansing and detoxification have become very popular and acupuncture
2645764 you are more able to reap the benefits of a spa when you have time to relax it can be life changing some people hire a personal trainer for an hour a day for the entire week
2645765 like with any cruise we want them to have fun and do exactly what they want to do and that doesnt always include water aerobics or deck walking
2645766 traveling together with people they know from water exercise gives them a comfort zone a lot of our water people are widows
2645767 it fills up first thing in the morning until about noon then fills back up between 3 and 6 p m its very busy especially days we are at sea we get all ages in here

2645775 the destruction of family businesses is often used as a motivation for repealing the estate tax but there is very little proof that many family businesses are devastated by the tax
2645776 there are very few ways to get around the tax entirely
2645777 but there are any number of ways to reduce the tax
2645778 you often get a scenario where the relatives who control the business feel like theyre working in part to produce profits for the others who are doing no work
2645779 and the ones who are doing no work are often saying how do i get value for this asset
2645780 how much would someone pay for a 20 percent stake in a franchise when he wouldnt have the deciding vote
2645781 but it would not be at all unreasonable that the combined effect of the minority and marketability discount would be in the 30 to 40 percent range
2645782 our principal concern is where we will find the money
2645783 if the irs comes in with a valuation that is different than what we have we will have a hard time serving the debt in installments
2645784 if there is a proper level of sophistication in the estate planning a family wouldnt be in the position of having to sell its business because of the estate tax with proper planning the inheritance tax isnt a fatal blow
2645785 if you dont have outside assets to sell or life insurance and dont have enough money to pay installments that is where you can have a problem
2645786 almost always there are techniques or other strategies to mitigate any impact from the federal estate tax

2645790 we moved pinkston to left tackle lucas nix to right tackle second team and chris jacobson to second team right guard
2645791 we wanted to give jordan gibbs a few days but i wasnt happy with the way that was moving and joe thomas has been ok but i think the best competition we could give him is putting nix behind him
2645792 jonathan baldwin made a catch that let everybody know that he plans on competing
2645793 wimax is the cheapest channel to do this and it is the channel that can deliver the best quality of service
2645794 we have tried to root the bible in the culture of this country and have the permission of the local cardinals to print this all religions have some meeting ground and indology has been taught at catholic seminaries for decades prabhu is also against alternative medicine pranic healing yoga and several other cultural traditions

2645813 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2645814 kids are getting so many crazy messages in our culture and i felt they needed a different role model and an alternative on what success really is
2645815 the guy with the trophy and the starters are not the only ones who are successful true success if about giving your best toward your potential and purpose
2645816 when coach george and coach harvey approached me about working this camp last summer i was really excited about it
2645817 i really believe in what we are teaching here i never believed i could play professionally when i was the age of these kids and i like being able to help them out
2645818 they sit down and discuss life and how to be a better person
2645819 that makes this camp so unique from any one i have ever been involved in before its really pretty cool
2645820 its really fun and they push you really hard to work hard on everything
2645821 we are learning other skills than just basketball its fun learning about how you need to use all these skills to be better at everything
2645822 the playbook that we use teach what we feel is the most important part of athletics at any level and that is character development and the qualities that will make successful people and athletes
2645823 our hope in this camp is to provide an avenue for parents concerned with our win at all costs era of sports and provide a refreshing look into what we can do through basketball to try to reach impact and serve as many boys and girls that walk through our doors with the true meaning and purpose of athletics

2645870 hold onto them like they were reins and you wont fall off
2645871 i dont think ive ever heard of such a thing but now that you mention it elephants do have a reputation for being clean since they shower themselves with their trunks
2645872 anyway back to the elephant an elephant due to its size is bound to be dirtier than i am
2645873 so my kind is despised persecuted and trapped on fly paper whereas the elephant is made into a hero even into a god called ganesh in india it isnt fair it isnt fair it isnt fair

2645879 do you know how to spell my name look it up
2645880 and drink when youve had enough just plug it up with the stalk its honeysuckle i had to look all over to get one small enough for you
2645881 i am wondering what you meant when you said there is nothing in any world to fear how many worlds are there
2645882 as many as you can imagine and more there is no end they never run out but in the universe all worlds turn toward one theyre all made up of the same thing
2645883 when you know what you are then you will know what all the worlds are there is the world of mankind that you already know a little bit about because you are a little girl now there is the world of insects that you are learning about a little bit because you are now in our world there is the world of the elephant mr diptera sneered slightly that you probably have known but dont remember there are the worlds of the fairy and the tree the worlds of dirt water air fire and light the worlds of birds the worlds of metal and the worlds of stone fish have worlds too
2645884 these are earthly worlds so you can understand what i mean when i mention them
2645885 we all work and live and die together and do it again and again
2645886 then it will be autumn when leaves fall to the earth those leaves that havent been eaten by bugs will become soil and eventually so will the bodies of the bugs
2645887 then the spring will come with the rain and the sunlight and the vine will turn green again the vine will be fed by the air especially the air that humans breathe out of their noses and mouths it is rich in carbon dioxide look up carbon dioxide along with
2645888 in the summer the human will come along again and pick the melon the man and his wife and their children will get strength and life from the food and will the bugs the insects and the microbes
2645889 and the earth will go to sleep so to say again in the winter and wake up again in the spring as the earth turns around the sun on which we all depend
2645890 i hate to go to sleep but here i am if im asleep its not so bad but im not sure im asleep
2645891 is death like this my cat fred died you know and i was very sad do you think fred woke up in a new world like me being here now

2645895 fear is a gate we walk through there are many worlds and they are one and i am them am i sunlight or am i night asleep or awake
2645896 i am a rather attractive fly what pretty fly eyes i have
2645897 the spider cant hurt you nothing can harm you there is nothing in the world in any world to fear

2645906 guru dan kyai saya juga merokok jawaban kalau sudah jelas dalil bahwa rokok hukumnya haram dan sudah banyak kenyataan bahwa rokok berbahaya maka wajib bagi kita mengikuti dalil bukan mengikuti manusia walaupun dia adalah seorang guru kyai maupun dokter karena semua manusia pasti pernah dan bisa bersalah dan keliru karena mereka tidak mashum terjaga dari kesalahan syubhat sebagian perokok mengatakan mereka yang merokok toh bisa berumur panjang dan sehat tidak merasakan bahaya merokok
2645907 apakah anda rela bila anak anak anda merokok kan umur ditangan alloh dan ada perokok yang umurnya panjang
2645908 kenapa anda tidak menyarankan dan menganjurkan kepada anak anda untuk merokok sedari kecil kalau memang rokok tidak membahayakan kesehatan

2645913 we have mobilised all forces including the military and police to overcome the effects of the floods
2645914 we are trying to get to the flood victims bury the dead and provide medical treatment to the injured
2645915 telecommunications cables have been cut in some areas it takes half a day to walk from the local commune headquarters to the places were victims are stranded
2645916 eight people were killed in our province mostly by landslides and flash flood
2645917 we have warned people of the risk of more landslides
2645918 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2645919 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2645920 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2645921 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2645922 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2645923 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2645924 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2645925 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2645926 the arguments in favour of appreciation pre date recent concerns over inflation simply put china cannot rebalance its economy with a severely undervalued currency we expect rapid appreciation to continue
2645927 the secretary general is alarmed by the escalation of hostilities in georgia which have resulted in large numbers of casualties and massive destruction in south ossetia and other regions of georgia
2645928 profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone including the bombing of the upper kodori valley
2645929 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2645930 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2645931 the georgians have made an offer of a cease fire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2645932 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2645933 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2645934 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2645935 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal
2645936 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september
2645937 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october
2645938 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders
2645939 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2645940 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2645941 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2645942 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it

2646007 seeing everybody so close together that is not usually how it is after the first 200 that is usually how it is after the 300 mark so i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger

2646009 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and going into the ready room i started getting these kind of like chills up my body

2646022 today was one of those things we got an e mail from wiz this morning saying she was looking forward to coming to the match she said shed be here
2646023 this game was completely dedicated to wiz bachman and her family
2646024 you have to understand what wiz bachman means to usa volleyball she is like the nicest person in the world she is in our family so her family is like our family because they traveled with us and she fought in the 2004 olympics with us and she was my roommate

2646030 i was completely stunned heartbroken it was a blow to the stomach
2646031 here we are celebrating our sport at its all time high its never been this big this great to play this game world participation is in over 200 countries
2646032 but i dont believe thats a reason you look at basketball you look at gymnastics all those sports were dominant
2646033 theyve moved the mound back three feet theyve changed the ball from white to yellow so theyve done so many things and moved back the fences
2646034 in 2004 we out scored opponents 50 something to 1 at the same time we were hitting the ball so i dont think its the rules
2646035 its supposed to be about excellence the olympics is about doing amazing things
2646036 i was completely stunned heartbroken it was a blow to the stomach
2646037 here we are celebrating our sport at its all time high its never been this big this great to play this game world participation is in over 200 countries

2646041 its supposed to be about excellence the olympics is about doing amazing things
2646042 its too good of a sport not to be there you know numerous stadiums are built a softball field is not that big a deficit
2646043 green jackets and pimiento cheese behind the scenes with the masters tournament committee
2646044 fencing is an amazing sport because no two matches are ever the same it never gets old
2646045 only thing is its not so amazing as a spectator sport there are complicated issues in fencing stuff thats over my head
2646046 or else i could gain 15 pounds and become a normal college student
2646047 green jackets and pimiento cheese behind the scenes with the masters tournament committee
2646048 fencing is an amazing sport because no two matches are ever the same it never gets old

2646050 or else i could gain 15 pounds and become a normal college student
2646051 i just hope any success we have makes the sport more prosperous
2646052 most people have never heard of fencing but if we get one girl out there to pick up a sabre shes our goal
2646053 mais nous ne saurons pas partir je dois voir lavocat le 24
2646054 las fechas cambiaron pero estoy muy entusiasmada de llegar con este espect culo al auditorio el cual es el mismo que se realiz en el unplugged

2646056 he tratado de controlarlos los nervios y canalizarlos arriba del escenario
2646057 the psychopath liar doesnt have these responses feeling bad or a guilty conscience so its much more difficult to pick up on cues that they are lying

2646061 el mayor genocidio que ha sufrido la raza humana en toda su historia
2646062 desde su legalizacion este exterminio indiscriminado ha dejado al conjunto del holocausto nazi las purgas de stalin y mao en mera anecdota puesto que ya ha sido asesinada al menos una cuarta parte de la poblacion mundial actual
2646063 desde la legalizacion del aborto en los 70 se producen anualmente entre 35 y 60 millones de intervenciones al a o lo que deja un macabro balance de mas de 1 500 millones de seres humanos eliminados antes de nacer es decir que si el mundo tiene ahora 6 700 millones de habitantes se ha asesinado a una cuarta parte de las personas en menos de 40 a os
2646064 el fin de la hipocresia de los gobiernos que se rasgan las vestiduras por los crimenes de la alemania nacionalsocialista o las purgas de stalin y mao y permiten que bajo su tutela se asesine a 45 millones de seres indefensos por a o a lo que habria que sumar el alto numero de suicidios que se producen entre las madres que optaron por interrumpir el embarazo
2646065 si los gobiernos quieren realmente mejorar la economia mundial sobre todo en esta crisis deberian seguir los consejos de los economistas en linea con lawrence roberge que denuncian los efectos perversos del aborto en la economia y que se constatan con la actual coyuntura asi dependemos de la mano de obra inmigrante para asegurar las pensiones y existe una contraccion de la demanda de bienes y servicios que seria menor de no haberse eliminado a esos 1 500 millones de potenciales consumidores
2646066 i live in that high and holy place with those whose spirits are contrite and humble i refresh the humble and give new courage to those with repentant hearts

2646081 until youve used a computer where the os was written for the specific hardware you just dont know what youre missing
2646082 damn this level design is freaking twisted how can someone be so evil
2646083 im looking for some alien toilet to park my bricks whos first
2646084 one fucking lost hour this is some stupid shit crappy coding crap
2646085 using the flash 9 public alpha s compiler you can define a as file with multiple classes defined in a single package block and it compiles and runs just fine
2646086 i float in an amniotic solution of galaxies and ideas i dont really exist in the corporeal sense but in the internet sense with only this blog as proof that there is something out there named john romero
2646087 oh yeah i never did figure out what the hell that def fn keyword was used for
2646088 i walked out with two of the worlds most awesome piece of electronics
2646089 were building our business and at the same time trying to keep up with it
2646090 were expecting a big spike before during and after the democratic convention and a very busy and steady runup to election day
2646091 its not surprising in the sense of how close the race is
2646092 but obama has really mastered the internet and the small gift hes just had money flooding in and for mccain to even be competitive is surprising to me
2646093 i dont think its that hes doing better than expected i think its that obama is doing worse than he would expect
2646094 its been a pretty exciting career although i guess you always say that the most recent place youve worked has been the most exciting
2646095 control over mines and natural resources may be beyond our present constitution
2646096 it might be misconstrued as a ploy to extending the term of the president
2646097 we definitely need more consultation dialogues and information dissemination so that people can come up with well informed positions on the moa
2646098 this is an opportunity for donors to give far more to a candidate than the law allows and still have the candidate know it
2646099 all of this money is going to benefit the presidential candidate and while it might not end up in their own campaign account its going to be working to their benefit its a way for a donor to separate themselves from the pack of run of the mill 2 300 donors and possibly gain greater influence with the candidate
2646100 we think that they are an end around the campaign finance system and more importantly around its intent which is to limit the significance of any one donor in helping a person get elected
2646101 its fairly absurd that you could go from a 2 300 maximum and then kind of wake up from a long sleep and all of the sudden youve figured out how to make it 70 000
2646102 where mccain is hypocritical here is he himself has spoken out again the corrupting influence of big contributions the way that that affects policy in washington
2646103 i cant suspect that mccain would argue that 70 000 is not a big contribution
2646104 obama has really made it seem like his campaign was being driven by small contributions
2646105 and for him to be accepting contributions of tens of thousands of dollars is equally hypocritical to what mccains doing
2646106 the fact that ohioans in traditionally republican counties are supporting sen obama shows that ohioans of all political stripes are ready for a president who will end the same old divisive politics and give hardworking families a voice in washington again
2646107 obviously theres the letter of the law and the spirit of the law
2646108 and mccain is obeying the letter of the law and not the spirit hes championed over the years
2646109 on the other hand once barack obama figured out that he could raise more money than he could get from public financing he seemed to have no problem moving in that direction without even a look back
2646110 as we often say in classes here political parties exist to win elections
2646111 and the fact that people will exploit the weak spots of a particular legislation or regulation to their fullest in order to win those elections shouldnt come as a surprise to people
2646112 youve got vacation you got people on the beach if you were going to take a week off this is probably an intelligent time to do it ill be watching the olympics ill be watching the olympics as much as possible
2646113 its sort of the standard ones ill be interested in seeing how the basketball team does how the baseball team does you know i like it all
2646114 were all caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
2646115 obviously its better to use less radiation if it works just as well
2646116 why would you want to go for six weeks when you can get it done in five treatment days
2646117 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2646118 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2646119 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2646120 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2646121 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2646122 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2646123 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2646124 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2646125 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2646126 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2646127 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2646128 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2646129 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2646130 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2646131 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2646132 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2646133 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2646134 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2646135 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2646136 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2646137 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2646138 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2646139 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2646140 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2646141 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2646142 the hope was to get kids interested in the stem science technology engineering and math fields
2646143 so were trying to show them the students there are multiple ways to solve a problem
2646144 even the software itself changes so rapidly you have to be able to recognize what you know and be able to apply it to new situations
2646145 this has helped me to think about other career choices
2646146 what i hear more from clients is that the landscape is very cluttered and traditional advertising isnt as effective any more
2646147 i do think the economy is playing a role but its also a more direct measurable opportunity to get a product out there than traditional media i think a lot of the brand managers especially with consumer product companies are starting to realize that
2646148 it was at the forefront of voice over internet and lot of people didnt understand it
2646149 running a national television spot youll have millions of impressions and exposure but it wont necessarily translate to action on the part of the consumer for purchase whereas interaction in a sampling program one to one with a brand ambassador the consumer is much more apt to develop a more favorable impression of the brand and ultimately act and purchase
2646150 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2646151 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2646152 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2646153 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2646154 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2646155 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2646156 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2646157 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2646158 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2646159 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2646160 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2646161 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2646162 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2646163 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2646164 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2646165 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2646166 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2646167 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2646168 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2646169 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2646170 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2646171 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2646172 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2646173 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2646174 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2646175 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2646176 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2646177 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2646178 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2646179 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2646180 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2646181 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2646182 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2646183 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2646184 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2646185 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2646186 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2646187 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2646195 father where are you going without your son whither are you going 0 holy priest without your deacon you were never wont to offer sacrifice without me your minister wherein have i displeased you have you found me wanting to my duty try me now and see whether you have made choice of an unfit minister for dispensing the blood of the lord
2646196 i do not leave you my son but a greater trial and a more glorious victory are reserved for you who are stout and in the vigor of youth
2646197 you often complain that we treat you with cruelty but no tortures are here thought of i only inquire mildly after what concerns you i am informed that your priests offer in gold that the sacred blood is received in silver cups and that in your nocturnal sacrifices you have wax tapers fixed in golden candlesticks bring to light these concealed treasures the prince has need of them for the maintenance of his forces i am told that according to your doctrine you must render to caesar the things that belong to him i do not think that your god causeth money to he coined he brought none into the world with him he only brought words give us therefore the money and be rich in words
2646198 the church is indeed rich nor hath the emperor any treasure equal to what it possesseth i will show you a valuable part but allow me a little time to set everything in order and to make an inventory
2646199 what are you displeased at the gold which you so eagerly desire is a vile metal and serves to incite men to all manner of crimes the light of heaven is the true gold which these poor objects enjoy their bodily weakness and sufferings are the subjects of their patience and the highest advantages vices and passions are the real diseases by which the great ones of the world are often most truly miserable and despicable behold in these poor persons the treasures which i promised to show you to which i will add pearls and precious stones those widows and consecrated virgins which are the churchs crown by which it is pleasing to christ it hath no other riches make use then of them for the advantage of rome of the emperor and yourself
2646200 do you thus mock me is it thus that the axes and the fasces the sacred ensigns of the roman power are insulted i know that you desire to die this is your phrensv and vanity but you shall not die immediately as you imagine i will protract your tortures that your death may be the more bitter as it shall be slower you shall die by inches

2646202 has come in part from being the spiritual director to people of the homosexual orientation
2646203 i did come to a point where i could no longer say the biblical account answers all of the questions we have or want to ask
2646204 it is entirely compatible with the christian faith not only to love another person of the same sex but also express that love fully in a personal sexual relationship
2646205 i suspect that a fuller exploration of the sexual metaphors of the bible will have more to teach us about a theology and ethics of sexual desire than will the flat citation of isolated texts and i hope other theologians will find this worth following up more fully than i can do here
2646206 affirming catholicism has consistently called for the full inclusion of lesbian and gay members of the church

2646279 where has the kirkuk crisis reached now what solutions are there what is the status of deliberations are we rotating in a vicious circle
2646280 where statements are made here and there leading to entrenchment behind political parties and trends in the arena
2646281 the kirkuk issue has reached the point where the components of the city lack trust in each other and that this was reflected in the iraqi parliament this lack of trust resulted in changing drafts 10 or 11 times concerning article 24 of the provincial council election law the changes involved certain phrases due to their sensitivity also resulting from the lack of trust among these components
2646282 the current discussions and deliberations rotate around the un proposal and we believe that this proposal is good except for some points that were raised by the two sides i believe that all sides have faith in the de mistura proposal but that lack of trust is the cause of the obstruction or delay that takes place every now and then
2646283 until the concerns of brother arabs and turkomans are eased
2646284 we support the holding of elections together with the distribution of administrative posts
2646285 because we were the side that requested such a committee to be formed from the beginning
2646286 this issue raises the concern of arabs and turkomans in kirkuk we began to establish the citys administration in the wake of the downfall of the former regime but the course of political action in kirkuk took a different trend as there was monopolization of power and occupation of government buildings and military camps
2646287 to begin with i object to the use of the term sunni arabs because the arabs in kirkuk sunnis and shiis are one component of the city the use of this term aims to fragment arab ranks in kirkuk
2646288 the concerns of brother arabs and turkomans are serious because since 9 april 2003 a drastic change has been taking place on the ground not mere allegations by brother arabs and turkomans and this was proved by the statistics used for allocating the 2008 budget funds
2646289 nevertheless the kurdish brothers did not adhere to implementing what was agreed and accordingly our concerns are serious this is why we insist on introducing guarantees to the provincial council election law
2646290 regrettably until this moment no consensus has been reached on the city and its administration
2646291 kirkuk is kurdish and i believe that it is so and i have ottoman documents of kurdish individuals who are not involved in this case to support my belief
2646292 this is because they know quite well that they will not win the seats that they already had
2646293 there is a moderate solution presented by the un secretary general which is being studied and there are continuous sessions about it despite the problems that were raised i believe that this proposal will be a decisive solution to the ambitions of the brothers in the kurdistan alliance and the legitimate rights of the brother arabs and turkomans in kirkuk otherwise we will be heading to hell and to further complications in kirkuk and the entire iraq
2646294 the citizens of kirkuk should determine the future of their city
2646295 the kurdistan alliance views the solution as one that is based on article 140 of the constitution

2646303 we are easily at a third of last years business there are far fewer people coming to saint tropez just to anchor for the evening he said

2646309 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks ms henton said
2646310 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a us110 130 band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2646311 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand chatham house said in a gloomy report entitled the
2646312 given recent price experience a spike in excess of us200 per barrel is not infeasible
2646313 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend mr jessop said
2646314 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2646315 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three percent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2646316 ever accelerating demand for commodities from emerging economies could not be taken for granted
2646317 the trend among asian countries towards cutting fuel subsidies will increase the sensitivity of demand to higher global oil prices by ensuring that final consumers bear more of the cost

2646367 we are going to be a mostly young team so there will be some growing pains along the way the freshmen have to learn how to play at a higher level but that will come with time and were in better physical shape than we were at this point last year but we still have some work to do on that front as well all in all i was pleased with the first day
2646368 its still going to take a little time for everyone to really mesh
2646369 but the lines of communication between the freshmen the returning players and the coaches have been very open so far everyone feels like they can communicate with each other and everyone has been comfortable with each other thats a good sign especially this early in the practice schedule
2646370 its always tough when youve got a veteran guy who is a good person works hard does everything you ask

2646382 i have already created a record of playing the mridangam non stop for 101 hours i have the confidence of still bettering this record
2646383 nobody in the music field has ever attempted this type of record of paying mridangam non stop for 101 hours and above whats more interesting is that he ramakrishnan himself is now attempting to break his earlier record which in itself is a unique attempt

2646391 i played a great first shot then a perfect 9 iron for 140 yards
2646392 it bounced in the front of the green but the wind blows just in the moment and it went down into the water
2646393 then again i had tried to make a good shot but again a lot of backspin again to the water and after that i got mad and played not very concentrated the whole rest of the round
2646394 i was almost fighting for the lead in the tournament and suddenly i was trying to make the cut

2646401 were definitely concerned that the pace of negotiations isnt moving quickly enough
2646402 weve had some preliminary talks with time warner but we hope they will become more substantive quickly theres still time but were a long way apart and weve got a lot of ground to cover
2646403 the fact that the big ten network was able to reach an agreement with comcast was encouraging
2646404 we are committed to doing what we can to get a deal done
2646405 its going to be a packed house and a lot of fun and a great atmosphere for these young guys to put on their nfl uniform for the first time walk out on the field and say oh my gosh here i am it beats some of the places like the swamp university of florida and the coliseum southern california these guys have been
2646406 but the field doesnt change im just going out to play football im not worried about the crowd big time players show up in big time situations thats what i strive for
2646407 every year youre excited about getting to the first preseason game hitting somebody else and then seeing how your younger people respond in that environment
2646408 some guys are in an nfl game for the first time its always fun to watch their reaction see who seems comfortable and see who maybe seems a little out of their element
2646409 the games are different than practice theres no way to simulate it itll be fun to watch and see how they operate
2646410 we have an idea of what green bays going to do
2646411 what wed like to do is do our thing and find out how our guys react to things they havent seen before
2646412 its mostly about can they react under game time pressure this is a great atmosphere because its monday night and its green bay its going to be like a regular season game were going to find out if the lights are too bright for em or theyre ready to go
2646413 were not going to be distracted by the whole brett favre thing
2646414 that has nothing to do with the cincinnati bengals thats a green bay thing
2646415 were going to leave the distractions to the media and just go out there and hustle play hard and do our assignments
2646416 first of all this is something youve been doing your whole life
2646417 its still 10 yards for a first down you still have to cross the goal line to score a touchdown the main thing is go out and have fun because whatever you do if you have fun doing it youll do it a lot better
2646418 it was a dark grey object and it was flying parallel to the ground
2646419 i dont want to get as i said last night prematurely stressed about it
2646420 but if it does happen then i will take due time to make sure that whatever decision that i come up with is what i think is the best decision for territorians and for the territory
2646421 i will have to consider their policies for the future and look at the talent on each side
2646422 all i want is to go back to the howard springs tavern have a steak a cold beer and rest my feet
2646423 i cannot thank him enough for the things hes done since ive been here for this organization for what hes taught me as a coach and what hes taught me as a person he is a classy guy he is a true pro and i wish him nothing but the best
2646424 chad was our leader on and off the field he has been the spiritual leader of our team and it is tough to lose him he and his wife robin hosted our team bible study every week they hosted players wives and even provided baby sitters for our children most of the time i am sad for us but i am happy for the team that gets him he will go that team have a huge impact there and be the leader of that team also
2646425 i cannot thank him enough for the things hes done since ive been here for this organization for what hes taught me as a coach and what hes taught me as a person he is a classy guy he is a true pro and i wish him nothing but the best
2646426 chad was our leader on and off the field he has been the spiritual leader of our team and it is tough to lose him he and his wife robin hosted our team bible study every week they hosted players wives and even provided baby sitters for our children most of the time i am sad for us but i am happy for the team that gets him he will go that team have a huge impact there and be the leader of that team also
2646427 going up through school math was something i guess i clung to and enjoyed doing
2646428 theres a bunch of seniors on the offensive line so ive got a lot of guys who are giving me input and a coach who is working with me trying to make me better
2646429 heres the thing you look at us o linemen we dont look like the brightest guys
2646430 but he is honestly one of the smartest kids i know he is just a funny kid to be around and a great person
2646431 well be taking about stuff and thinking about stuff sometimes thinking really hard about a problem and b b will always have the answer
2646432 he is just smart all the way around when hes playing he makes smart decisions and thats what we need this year
2646433 you can imagine in offensive line play there is an infinitesimal amount that you can keep trying to undertake and master if one chooses to
2646434 he was always good in school he was always up there with his grades while also doing sports and things
2646435 i wanted to be like him and maybe even be better
2646436 hes right on time because in year three thats when i really like to see guys starting to be really good players
2646437 then if that can continue through years three four and five thats when you can really be good
2646438 every once in a while it comes up but i hold my composure and laugh it off
2646439 its all fun and games with the guys thats why were a good unit
2646440 all i was trying to do was the right thing
2646441 the agent said we are going to be watching him we cant be watching you
2646442 they are humans no matter what they do all i was trying to do was the right thing i was just trying to do my job
2646443 its going to hem in the fed its going to be harder for the fed to weaken what theyve proposed
2646444 it sends a message that you did the right thing
2646445 the fed is going to act and is going to establish a new baseline for consumer protection that everyone will follow
2646446 we hope they will consider the impact this will have on pricing in the marketplace and the big question of whether or not low risk consumers are going to have to subsidize people who pose a higher risk

2646451 coach stew and coach lockwood told me if i didnt lose weight i wasnt playing
2646452 that was my main motivation too coach stew said if i got to like 180 185 he would let me return punts and i love to do it the 20 pounds i lost helped out too im much faster side to side i can step up better now its been good
2646453 at first i came in and i was a hothead
2646454 to the point where if coaches were criticizing me on a play i always had an excuse for it maybe i had a rep you cant be a leader out there when youre not doing things right if young guys see you blowing up at a coach
2646455 you later still think that you were right and he was wrong go step to him like a man and talk to him in his office

2646463 our counter thrust must be to prick holes in the stiff front erected by the russians leaders
2646464 thanks to the google maps graphic accompanying a story about russian incursions into georgia the nation state in the caucasus not the caucasian pride ridden state in the southern u
2646465 there arent a lot of black groups running around georgia terrorizing and lynching white folk
2646466 there were several attacks on georgia but strictly on military targets
2646467 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2646468 if we allow ourselves to do that the world will end up on a slippery slope toward an endless series of military conflicts we cannot allow that to happen
2646469 unfortunately since we have taken iraq unilaterally russia is free to take georgia unilaterally and any other province they can get away with
2646470 gt bloomfields amanda moreland gets in an early morning run at mendon ponds park last week
2646471 ive been on the varsity team since eighth grade and have learned you need to run everyday during the summer
2646472 cross country isnt like most sports where you can just show up at the first day of practice if you dont dedicate yourself to the sport youre going to feel it everywhere in your body
2646473 quite often people come out for the sport for casual reasons which is fine but they end up finding themselves in trouble because just three weeks of running before your first meet isnt enough
2646474 i dedicate about 65 percent of my summer to running
2646475 ive been training six days a week this entire summer
2646476 in addition to my 35 or more miles per week running i swim and hike
2646477 but i feel that placing in the top five is in my reach
2646478 getting the mental mindset to run a long distance at a strong pace is hard
2646479 after two miles you just have to hold on and fight cramps its a struggle to move your arms and power through the ups and downs of the course
2646480 whats so great about this sport is that everyone gets to play and not have to worry about playing time
2646481 these guys dont get the same glory as other sports because there are no stands for people to sit in and watch
2646482 but my athletes have told me how their friends on other sports teams talk of how much running we do
2646483 i tried out for the soccer team in my freshman year and was cut
2646484 it turned out to be the best thing that has ever happened to me cross country is so hard which makes it so rewarding people always think they cant do it i try to tell them that it is easier than it looks which is a lie but most people are still afraid of the pain they might endure
2646485 having to run three miles as hard as you can is no walk in the park
2646486 one of the worst meets ive seen was in st lawrence when it was hailing
2646487 the mud was up to the athletes shins but its like a right of passage for them they take the mud and smear it on their faces
2646488 one of my athletes she was new asked if the meet was going to be canceled
2646489 the veterans just looked at her and laughed and informed her that cross country runs in all weather
2646490 in 2000 we had a meet in auburn with a hill you couldnt even run up
2646491 there was also a meet in weedsport about two years ago with a hill so steep kids were sloshing sliding and slipping all over
2646492 most people that come to our course dread running the hill especially when conditions are poor
2646493 a lot of people have to walk up it because there isnt any traction
2646494 the weather is the most fun part the colder the better i love running in the rain wind and mud its too bad that we cant make cross country more like it is in europe with the obstacles
2646495 when its colder out you have to use more mental energy which makes it more rewarding to persevere
2646496 probably the worst meet ive ever run in was my sophomore year at flcc for the league championship flcc was basically washed out and you could barely make it up the hill
2646497 even though your chest feels like its going to explode and your legs feel like cement it is a very rewarding feeling
2646498 the sport in general is actually very fun and the feeling of being successful after a race is so great

2646517 no one wanted to come here and were losing our target kids to schools like wheaton and messiah
2646518 but we used to require a swatch of a students favorite sweater along with their application if we saw any reindeer or weird striped patterns their app went right into the trash harsh maybe but we needed to bring the sexy back to gordon
2646519 people who put plastic trash in a barrel and burn it are releasing more dioxins than any single industrial complex
2646520 we want to cause as much chaos for the websites as possible

2646528 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2646529 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2646530 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2646531 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2646532 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2646533 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2646534 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2646535 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2646536 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2646537 yesterday i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2646538 im just very embarrassed very disappointed in myself that i completely forgot how to play golf
2646539 the ryder cup is over for me thats how i look at it
2646540 the only noise i heard was somebody getting hit by a golf ball and they were grunts
2646541 this tournament is not going to be won by 1 under par
2646542 its such a tough golf course that they dont need to trick it up
2646543 the fairways are running 30 to 40 yards the greens are like concrete its not enjoyable to play theyve taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap
2646544 if we had it like this once a year ok
2646545 but it seems like we have this 15 times a year
2646546 nothing is ever going to get as tough as royal birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
2646547 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet
2646548 the only way to keep it on the green is to hit 75 feet away
2646549 we are not used to seeing this kind of major at a pga championship
2646550 but its still a major so youve got to realize it and just keep playing hard and hopefully youll be there on sunday
2646551 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second

2646556 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2646557 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2646558 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2646559 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2646560 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2646561 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2646562 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2646563 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2646564 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2646565 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2646566 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2646567 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2646568 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2646569 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2646570 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2646571 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

2646605 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2646606 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2646607 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2646608 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2646609 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2646610 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
2646611 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2646612 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2646613 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
2646614 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2646615 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man

2646624 the question is to what degree do we mix human rights and these protests with the olympic games i like to see the olympic games being about athletes about peace and harmony in the world

2646640 packed as they are now is simply one of mass consumption
2646641 and i think many other people who devote their energies to the festival desire the same thing and that comes from how our country has changed over the past seven eight years its been a tough stretch
2646642 it feels relevant to invest ones energies in something that does a little bit to create new community connections or to give people a chance to experience the arts in a way where they dont have to go through a fence or there isnt a beer garden or they arent preyed upon for 4 bottles of water its giving people an opportunity to have a little bit of a part in an event they can interact in it a little bit more
2646643 we offer the bait we offer the event at the end of the bike ride and we think we might be able to redefine what people think a bikable distance is
2646644 and peace coffee is a great supporter because they provide whats called a sag wagon which is basically a van that transports peoples camping gear so you dont have to be a professional camper to come to the festival

2646652 speak to as many people as possible especially people who have been through it theres truly a plethora of information out there in the library doctors all the breast cancer agencies
2646653 ask a lot of questions what are you doing why are you doing it and tell them to speak in english not doctor talk
2646654 patients awareness is increasing and thats whats really driving it
2646655 women hear about patients who are happy with their treatment and theyre asking their surgeons about it but first they need awareness
2646656 my cancer was so deep inside my breast that the mammosite balloon wasnt deep enough
2646657 dr dunn had to take it out and put it back in
2646658 and made clicking noises whenever the radiation would move inside your breast you didnt feel anything smell anything touch anything
2646659 some people do crosswords sleep you can do about anything
2646660 im sure the fans sellout crowd of 66 389 were definitely standing on their tippy toes watching that one so it was a good way to finish it off
2646661 the feeling going through turn 3 when i really thought i got it was yeah
2646662 my reaction coming out of turn 4 was no but i have to still finish the race i didnt know how many cars were behind dixon
2646663 the urs tournament is a great tradition teams are glad to come play in it and give back a little bit into the community im a believer of if you take something out you put something back thats what were trying to do

2646693 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2646694 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2646695 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2646696 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2646697 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2646698 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks ms henton said
2646699 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a us110 130 band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2646700 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand chatham house said in a gloomy report entitled the
2646701 given recent price experience a spike in excess of us200 per barrel is not infeasible
2646702 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend mr jessop said
2646703 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2646704 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three percent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2646705 ever accelerating demand for commodities from emerging economies could not be taken for granted
2646706 nioc is from now on obliged to deposit 100 percent of crude oil export income in foreign bank accounts that are chosen by the central bank of iran state television quoted the new government directive as saying
2646707 this decision was made after the expansion of new rounds of sanctions against iran so that irans assets are not blocked in foreign banks the
2646708 many foreign banks and even some chinese banks have cut their financial operations with iran and these restrictions increase day by day the source said
2646709 interesting to see if this trend continues in the next quarter which could prove highly ominous for the banks overall reputation
2646710 shock therapy to turn around its fortunes hiving off part of its troubled investment banking arm and cutting around 5500 jobs
2646711 the dow jones was up over 300 points and that sets up a good day for our market in a broader sense although there are going to be a raft of winners and losers mr james said
2646712 the oil price being down us5 a barrel is certainly going to weigh down the energy sector although banks should continue to do well
2646713 the time that is effectively used to send or receive the data expressed as a percentage of total period of time
2646714 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2646715 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2646716 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2646724 you dont play arsenal each day it is a tricky draw we already said that
2646725 but in football anything can happen we must prepare ourselves well and work like crazy for each other on the field
2646726 we must go into the match relaxed and with the belief that we can win there is no pressure for us
2646727 what the exact reason was did not become clear to me but according to the lawyer the club might wanted to renounce the transfer
2646728 i immediately called kai lerby the agent of boukhari but he knew of nothing
2646729 the deal is that they now have to pay us the transfer fee
2646730 winning the first half of a tournament isnt a title we have nothing to celebrate

2646735 higher mathematics scores were related to adequate access to computer technology hardware software and overall infrastructure

2646737 the four are no longer part of the first team of ajax as of today later this week they will report to young ajax awaiting further developments
2646738 decency and moral seem to have left ajax since marco van basten took over
2646739 in spite of the fact that ajax six months ago persuaded perez to come back to the club and in spite of the fact that he on several occasions has played very well sometimes as a captain ajax is now going to stop him and keep him from doing his work properly on a high level
2646740 marco van basten informed kenneth perez at their meeting that he was satisfied with kenneths attitude but that he in the future should practise with the youth team and that he should not expect to play games since ajax prefer to use only young players in that team
2646741 in the meeting that took place tuesday night where kenneths agent karsten aabrink negotiated with the management from ajax both sides agreed that it is a very bad solution for both ajax and kenneth perez that he is going to practise with the youth team
2646742 a financial solution should be found to solve the problem
2646743 the situation for kenneth perez is still unacceptable and unclear but first artists agent karsten aabrink is working to solve it

2646748 it was always handled as a missing persons because we never got any new information
2646749 this is what the entire southeast looked like at one time
2646750 i dont know that any other state has done this much conservation
2646751 folks live in the area drive by every day and dont know whats here
2646752 if there was a 4 000 home subdivision they would know it
2646753 our agency feels that it is very important to lifeguard as much of the beach as possible
2646754 everybody sort of liked the idea of expanding the guarded area
2646755 i think there was a feeling of expanding their prc authority and the city just wasnt comfortable with that
2646756 we dont believe that surfing and swimming mix very well
2646757 they isle of palms dont have any laws on the book its a significant issue every year surfing and swimming just dont mix
2646758 we agreed to get back together during the offseason i dont know what the conclusion will be
2646759 he was an outstanding deputy i intend for this officer to be remembered
2646760 dennis is a hero if he hadnt gotten there the other night somebody else would have died who wouldnt have had a chance he had a chance because he was a trained deputy this is what we do
2646761 i profess it and i know it in my heart that he has dennis safe
2646762 you have to concentrate or youll get hit by a wave
2646763 i heard the numbers were really high for kids who did not go to school that first week
2646764 hopefully this will be a way to get students in school on the first day
2646765 its easy for some students to not do something they dont want to and a lot of teenagers dont want to go to school
2646766 i think initially its kind of a shock because people dont like solicitation but when people hear that were passing out school information they lighten up
2646767 when they hear that were out here for the charleston county school district and the police department theyre more responsive
2646768 we want you to treat your subordinates in a way that makes them excel instead of simply obeying
2646769 inspiring a new cadet can get more than obedience to the minimal standard
2646770 the type of leadership we want does not imply softness
2646771 if you take someone out of their comfort zone you can really see what theyre made of
2646772 the fact that she was female became part of the equation
2646773 were spending way too much we need to cut back
2646774 eric if you want to get into the bed give me a thumbs up
2646775 the last thing i heard was that you guys werent coming to the reunion your dad cancelled the trip
2646776 theres about 15 or 20 acts that have done it but madonna is the big one her and mary j blige im not bragging but ive made some money off it i dont have to work if i dont want to
2646777 i was in clubs nobody was working but me what i call ghetto clubs in black neighborhoods a circuit from new york to california
2646778 we had rochester buffalo pittsburgh cincinnati down south and out west we played about 20 clubs twice a year it wasnt a lot of money but it kept us busy but that bebop didnt work right away in the ghetto clubs and so we had to moderate it down like in the chitlin circuit they wanted to hear the blues and some swing danceable music once i got them in my corner then i could sneak in some of that other stuff
2646779 but there was a problem getting amplification in some of these clubs that didnt have the electrical setup so thats when i started working with a b 3 organist
2646780 they had people who suggested we do cover tunes they were paying good money blue note had just paid us scale so we did it
2646781 ive got a blues i sing that is very political and very funny about george bush and his mistake starting the war that people really seem to like
2646782 it revitalized me that people were going crazy because they didnt know i could still play that way
2646783 im 81 and i went out the other day and shot a 41 for nine holes so you know im feeling good
2646784 so many people are fed up with todays options for girls and the short window for girlhood
2646785 they are looking to the past for role models and stories but in a future oriented way
2646786 it was a very very very different life than mine
2646787 she got to ride horses she had a mom and dad that stayed at the house more often and sisters that werent really mean to her
2646788 there was a little doll made of corn or something
2646789 this was her first musical and i grew up watching melissa gilbert so i was very excited to come see her
2646790 our set of books were passed from my mother to me to my daughter to josie so four generations
2646791 its just a fabulous story a good family story its good for every age
2646792 i like learning how it relates to real life and things about the past
2646793 it feels like im always there especially here in the play it just kind of feels like im there
2646794 girls do have wiis nintendo at 9 i wanted a canopy bed and a pony my daughter wants an iphone this is the world our girls live in there is more of a challenge more media more culture to assimilate and tease out and so much of it is very appealing
2646795 theres something to be said about pastimes that girls have always had to remember some of that too its nice that sometimes they can have very solitary creative pursuits without having to blog about it
2646796 for a girl to be earnest about what she likes to speak up it is kind of daring to include a recipe in a book for girls when we know so much about how girls are limited its daring to reclaim these things this everyday daring like raising your hand in class
2646797 doesnt have to choose to be sparkly or daring she can be both she can be a budding technology geek who also plays soccer the world is a big place
2646798 our trust in them and their trust in us allows us to go a little deeper and even mine the personal events in their lives
2646799 we talk about the cringe worthy things that weve done and then laugh about them afterwards thats what happens to our audiences theyre so mortified but then they see themselves in it and they can only laugh theres something liberating about it
2646800 its really really difficult to make a movie that has any sort of truth in it any real human interaction and behavior in it with the studio model of a big crew and budget jay and i came out of film school in our 20s trying to make movies in that kind of environment where you spend 90 percent of your time and energy managing the technical aspects of the film and then you realize oh i forgot we have to get good acting and story in here and you come up with what we like to call the hamburger without the meat
2646801 we flip flopped that equation of 90 percent of your time devoted to technical and 10 percent to story and acting
2646802 we dont have a lot of money and resources to make that glossy beautiful film but the things that are free are good story and good acting so we can actually put our energies there so it doesnt cost anything and get something that is genuine
2646803 we could talk about it for hours but the basic idea is two heads are better than one
2646804 it must have been really fun and less stressful for all the fleetwood mac ers to go off and make their solo albums but none of them was as successful as when they were together
2646805 the one who woke up in a good mood that morning usually leads the charge
2646806 and i think many other people who devote their energies to the festival desire the same thing and that comes from how our country has changed over the past seven eight years its been a tough stretch
2646807 it feels relevant to invest ones energies in something that does a little bit to create new community connections or to give people a chance to experience the arts in a way where they dont have to go through a fence or there isnt a beer garden or they arent preyed upon for 4 bottles of water its giving people an opportunity to have a little bit of a part in an event they can interact in it a little bit more
2646808 we offer the bait we offer the event at the end of the bike ride and we think we might be able to redefine what people think a bikable distance is
2646809 and peace coffee is a great supporter because they provide whats called a sag wagon which is basically a van that transports peoples camping gear so you dont have to be a professional camper to come to the festival

2646812 dan tuhan berfirman lagi sekiranya penduduk sesebuah negeri itu beriman serta bertaqwa tentulah kami akan membuka kepada mereka pintu pengurniaan yang melimpah limpah berkatnya dari langit dan bumi tetapi mereka mendustakan rasul kami lalu kami timpakan mereka dengan azab siksa disebabkan apa yang mereka telah usahakan
2646813 patutkah penduduk negeri negeri itu bersedap hati serta merasa aman daripada kedatangan azab kami kepada mereka pada malam hari semasa mereka sedang tidur 97
2646814 atau patutkah penduduk negeri negeri itu bersedap hati serta merasa aman daripada kedatangan azab kami kepada mereka pada siang hari semasa mereka sedang leka bermain main 9
2646815 patutkah mereka bersukaria sehingga mereka merasa aman akan rancangan buruk balasan azab yang diatur oleh allah
2646816 telah timbul berbagai bagai kerosakan dan bala bencana di darat dan di laut dengan sebab apa yang telah dilakukan oleh tangan tangan manusia timbulnya yang demikian kerana allah hendak merasakan kepada mereka sebahagian dari balasan perbuatan perbuatan buruk yang mereka telah lakukan supaya mereka kembali insaf dan bertaubat
2646817 allah menjanjikan kepada orang orang yang beriman dan beramal solih dari kalangan kamu wahai umat muhammad bahawa dia akan menjadikan mereka khalifah khalifah yang memegang kuasa pemerintahan di bumi sebagaimana dia telah menjadikan orang orang yang sebelum mereka khalifah khalifah yang berkuasa dan dia akan menguat dan mengembangkan agama mereka islam yang telah diredhainya untuk mereka dan dia juga akan menggantikan bagi mereka keamanan keselamatan setelah mereka mengalami ketakutan dari ancaman musuh mereka terus beribadat kepadaku dengan tidak mempersekutukan sesuatu yang lain dengan ku dan ingatlah sesiapa yang kufur ingkar sesudah itu maka mereka itulah orang orang yang derhaka

2646900 then i think if god can close the mouths of lions
2646901 since im probably never going to see you again i can tell you that i do web design but maybe 75 of my income is from running an s amp m club in the east village i have a lot of work to do tonight send some emails pretending to be a girl get a commitment from the guy send the girl over
2646902 150 hours of lasercutter 1 8 stacked up to here
2646903 our greatest challenge is to maintain the distinctiveness of our faith in a world gone mad all of creation waits groans for a people who live gods dream with fresh imagination
2646904 what is the jesus follower to do when the empire gets baptized
2646905 jesus is forming a new kind of people a different kind of party whose peculiar politics are embodied in who we are the church is a people called out of the world to embody a social alternative that the world cannot know on its own terms
2646906 this whole project is about the political imagination of what it means to follow after jesus
2646907 the language of jesus as lord and savior is just as radical as it would be to say jesus is our commander in chief today
2646908 this is not about going left or right this is about going deeper and trying to understand together rather than endorse candidates we ask them to endorse what is at the heart of jesus and that is the poor or the peacemakers and when we see candidates promoting that then well get behind them
2646909 of course we cant continue on as a church there arent any young adults living around broad street anyway
2646910 just one section just finish this one section and then eat
2646911 youre on a roll dont quit now youre doing great be committed

2646913 oh i better check with my mom to make sure its ok
2646914 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2646915 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2646916 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2646917 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2646918 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2646919 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2646920 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2646921 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2646922 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2646923 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2646924 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2646925 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2646926 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2646927 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2646928 at what point do i consider him obviously maimed or dead
2646929 what if he is in an accident and the car explodes into flames and he his wallet and vehicle are all burned up how would they contact me how long does it take to identify by dental records
2646930 im sorry but its stupid for you to have worried
2646931 its not that i dont like having sex with tyler we have been going out for a few months now and just recently decided to become more intimate
2646932 its not that i dont like having sex with tyler
2646933 i guess im an offensive defenseman but i can play defense at the same time
2646934 i like to make sure my own end is taken care of first before worrying about anything else
2646935 were looking for him to be a good solid two way defenseman
2646936 hes a guy who goes back and makes a good first pass and can contribute some offense
2646937 we like the fact he led the league in scoring among defensemen were hoping to get more offense out of our defense and josh is a big part of that
2646938 it helped a lot that im a local guy who grew up about 45 minutes away from rmu i played junior hockey 10 hours away from home so i was looking to go to a school closer to home it was the right fit academically as well thats why i chose robert morris
2646939 you could see he wanted to be successful he had it in his plans a lot of kids want to be good hockey players but a lot of them dont want to follow through and do the extra work you need to do to be a division i player you could see right away that he had that work ethic
2646940 it helps out having some local guys kids with whom weve grown up playing hockey
2646941 the younger guys they see all the guys from pittsburgh playing locally at a high level
2646942 i think having local people shows a commitment to youth hockey in the area gives kids something to strive for to play at the next level
2646943 i think once you get one kid it kind of creates a pipeline
2646944 having a very good local player helps in getting other very good local players

2646959 new book out and making the move to open access
2646960 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
2646961 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
2646962 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2646963 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2647058 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2647059 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2647060 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2647061 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be

2647119 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
2647120 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
2647121 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
2647122 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
2647123 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
2647124 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
2647125 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
2647126 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
2647127 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
2647128 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy
2647129 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2647130 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2647131 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2647132 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2647133 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2647134 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2647135 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2647136 a compelling vision and a blueprint for action that will reinvent the way we educate children marshal resources pursue research projects and communicate and share discoveries
2647137 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2647138 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2647139 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2647140 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2647141 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2647142 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2647143 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2647144 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2647145 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2647156 oh my god those bloody chinese how on earth are we going to trump this
2647157 pennsylvania is basically a democrat leaning state a democrat really needs to have it if a republican wins it i think it is very likely that the republican wins the election nationally
2647158 a state that leans democrat in a climate in which the republican brand name is at a significant disadvantage
2647159 no doubt that pennsylvania is the only big state in the northeast that is still open to a republican
2647160 still my sense is that pennsylvania could only generously be called a toss up right now i think more correctly it is very light blue leaning to obama
2647161 obama will have to fall flat for pennsylvania to go republican in 2008 the african american vote is going to be way up and 95 97 percent for obama it will be tough for mccain to make up enough ground in the philly ring counties or the more rural parts of the state in the west but well see
2647162 ridge might just be able to deliver the state to mccain though it wouldnt be a slam dunk even then
2647163 most observers dont think ridge is going to be picked because of his pro choice position but with mccain the maverick you never really know
2647164 i expect both candidates to be spending a lot of time in pennsylvania this fall
2647165 this state is going to be critical because of the number of electoral votes at stake
2647166 its going to take a lot of hard work and commitment but senator obama has shown hes prepared to do that
2647167 we scored early and that always helps whenever you do that you are going to give your team opportunities to win games
2647168 there was nothing good about it the pitch to beltran was up and he took it for a ride being down 4 0 to start a game is never good the guys fought back though but i put our team in a spot where we had to fight the whole time
2647169 mccain loves lieberman and he is on the short list because lieberman has never embarrassed anyone never misspoken the first rule is dont take someone who costs you votes
2647170 conservatives would be pissed as hell i think you would have a revolt but sometimes john does what john wants to do
2647171 he can be pragmatic but on the biggest decisions he tends to favour his instinct for the bigger picture
2647172 first there was his call for americans to check their tires which is commonsense advice but hardly has the makings of a national energy strategy if we cant drill our way out of the problem it seems even more unlikely that we can inflate our way out of it
2647173 a serious energy plan involves a lot more yess than nos
2647174 if we cant drill our way out of the problem we cant inflate our way out of it either

2647209 the japanese government has agreed to extend more than rs 800 crore for providing a better transport system to the city this is just the first instalment and we will be signing an agreement with them sometime next month
2647210 we are pursuing the project on fast track and we intend to start work on it by this october
2647211 the project is in pre public investment board stage and once it is cleared by the board then it will go for the cabinet approval
2647212 we are investing around rs 2 000 crore to develop an integrated township in gwalior we are talking to a few big time investors for a stake sale in our spv
2647213 we are looking at a stake sale of 25 per cent amounting to around rs 300 crore the funds raised would be used for the gwalior project

2647219 japan intends to actively participate in the discussion on the nuclear deal at meeting with a comprehensive viewpoint that will strengthen non proliferation regime

2647221 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
2647222 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
2647223 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
2647224 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
2647225 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
2647226 the ministry is introducing service level benchmarking slb in five key areas of functioning of the civic agencies and the cities will have to meet the standards to be able to access central funds under the jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission jnnurm

2647229 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
2647230 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
2647231 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
2647232 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
2647233 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
2647234 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
2647235 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
2647236 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2647237 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2647238 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2647239 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2647240 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2647241 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2647242 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2647243 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2647244 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2647245 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2647246 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2647247 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2647251 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2647252 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2647253 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2647254 virtualization use has exploded since our last survey of the european market
2647255 both large organisations and smaller businesses are using the technology for a wider range of applications and for business critical projects as use of virtualization grows the challenges around managing complexity finding skills and software licensing become more apparent
2647256 some companies have both a large set of applications that can be managed more effectively and more importantly a backlog of applications they need to deploy
2647257 virtualization enables these companies to rationalize their application portfolio and deploy applications more effectively as the market matures we expect companies to start to measure their virtualization projects more closely and look for greater value from virtualization across their infrastructure
2647258 the range of approaches makes the right technology selection critical microsoft is making a strong push for market share later in 2008 vmware seems to be in the right place with its focus on business continuity and virtualization management citrix and the unix vendors are appealing to their core markets hp ibm fujitsu siemens computers dell sun bmc and others will look to take the lead in systems and management

2647312 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2647313 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2647314 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2647315 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2647316 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2647317 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2647318 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2647319 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2647320 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2647321 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2647322 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2647323 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2647324 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2647325 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2647326 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2647327 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2647328 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2647329 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2647330 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2647331 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2647332 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2647333 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2647334 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2647335 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2647336 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2647337 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2647338 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2647339 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2647340 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2647341 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2647342 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2647343 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2647344 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2647345 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2647346 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2647347 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2647348 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2647349 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2647350 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2647351 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2647352 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2647353 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2647354 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2647355 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2647356 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2647357 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2647358 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2647359 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2647360 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2647361 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2647362 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2647363 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2647364 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2647365 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2647366 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2647367 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2647368 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2647369 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2647370 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2647371 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2647372 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2647373 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2647374 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2647375 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2647376 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2647377 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2647378 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2647379 who are open to doing something on the production side
2647380 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2647381 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2647382 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2647383 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2647384 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2647385 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2647386 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2647387 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2647388 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2647389 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2647390 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2647391 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2647392 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2647393 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2647394 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

2647416 jangan jangan analysis cerdas kita tentang pilkada dan golput di milis ini hanya untuk memuas muaskan pikiran kita dalam olah nalar intelektual dan kita lupa bahwa pilkada itu kenyataan
2647417 seburuk buruk para kandidat salah satu pasang dari mereka akan menjadi gubernur sulsel dan akan menentukan nasib wilayah tempat kita semua pernah mengambil air minum

2647442 i thought our second group did a good job of bringing us back and making things close and getting some things done
2647443 our first group on either side of the ball wasnt really sharp and that was disappointing wanted to play better than we did last week and i didnt think we did that
2647444 the third drive went well we put some points on the board the first couple of drives it was tough well have to watch the film and see what happened
2647445 it was the same game plan as last week we were hoping it would be just like last week one drive knock it out do well and go home it didnt happen that way this week we had some things out there but we didnt capitalize and we have to see why
2647446 i wish we could have found a way to finish it off
2647447 it is the preseason but you have to keep working to get better
2647448 they had a lot of good players on their defense it was just a rough start all you can do is watch the film and see how you can improve and what you can do better
2647449 we still had some good individual performances especially with our young offensive guys so well get a chance to get on a normal week next week
2647450 thats the bad thing about it we had plenty of opportunities to go out there and win the game and we didnt we have to figure out how to close it

2647520 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2647521 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2647522 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2647523 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2647524 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be

2647536 i hoped i was wrong im very sad that i was right
2647537 when i move closer to pure poetry palestinians say go back to what you were but i have learned from experience that i can take my reader with me if he trusts me i can make my modernity and i can play my games if i am sincere
2647538 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2647539 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being

2647552 shes an author if you dont like her work dont buy it
2647553 if you did buy it and you read it you have no business returning it
2647554 thats like buying jewelry for a formal dance taping the tags out of sight and then returning it the next day in other words stealing
2647555 im all for people expressing their opinions whether they be positive or negative but there is no call for the blatant rudeness that has been filling this board and all the others since the second the first 7 chapters were leaked wtf
2647556 how many of you same people calling yourselves fans were all over the discussion board completely obsessed with this book before it even came out
2647557 where do you get off being pissed at the book for its failure to measure up to the insane hype you helped create
2647558 i was on the boards with my theories and hopes too but guess what
2647559 disappointment is not justification to act like an a hole
2647560 hacking into twilight fansites talking sh about the author and telling people to burn their books or return their books after theyve read them is crap
2647561 you should be ashamed of yourselves god knows the rest of us twilight fans are seriously get over yourselves
2647562 i started twilightmoms because i was going through some midlife crisis i was obsessed with the books i thought i was the only adult woman who had read the books and was preoccupied 24 hours a day with the relationships between these vampires werewolves and humans it was my shameful dark secret i never talked to anyone about it except the teenage girls that babysat my kids
2647563 in the beginning we found out what actors had filled the twilight movie roles of the books characters we knew the fans didnt know and nobody was telling them so we went ahead and did it
2647564 full load of housework kids husband and a website that feels like a second full time job
2647565 if you need any help stalking um i mean doing investigative reporting please let me know i am pretty excited about all of this so i would be willing to do anything follow you around with a fan grab your coffee whatever to help lynds
2647566 its great that twilight already has this built in fan base

2647580 the person who has the most time wins if you have a tight deadline the other side can wait you out to get the better deal you feel pressure the other side is calm collected and patient
2647581 they call this the information age and certainly information is money the more knowledgeable you are the better a deal you will get
2647582 this is really a common sense approach to people skills
2647583 a real solid group of girlfriends about six of us who are really tight a lot of them are from when i was little and were still superclose a solid group of girls will get you through anything believe me i know i feel bad for the women who dont believe that
2647584 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2647585 i firmly believe that sexiness is all to do with your state of mind some people radiate an inner sense of self esteem and beauty thats irresistible with sexy darling i wanted to capture this by creating a fragrance for todays sexy self assured woman who is passionate and playful a woman who is seductive and sensual im very excited that sexy darlings fusion of floral and woody notes is a rich sophisticated fragrance that truly lives up to its name

2647591 people are not going to want to hear from me
2647592 they are going to say what does she want me to sign up for now
2647593 julie is a great person for the group as she is in the age range but most importantly she has great insight about business as well as being a true professional
2647594 she reacted with wonderful enthusiasm and cooperation julie was very excited about this new group and recognized the need
2647595 we want to take the focus off the less mundane networking aspect
2647596 if something positive business wise comes of it thats great but its not the emphasis
2647597 hopefully the group will help retain talented young people and promote getting involved in the community
2647598 i think a lot of young people want to get involved but they just dont know where to turn
2647599 i was 27 and it was scary to take the plunge
2647600 but its been great its nice to make your own decisions
2647601 its kind of nice having a block of time to myself i can recap the day and plan for the next one
2647602 not only did she photograph someone at an event but her reflection is in the guys glasses as well
2647603 i just love that picture i really do it was purely accident to be honest with you
2647604 she told this story and that was something very different and we appreciated that as well
2647605 the pure joy in the little boys face really touched all the judges
2647606 he knew that i sent it in the mail for a contest and he kept asking me did i win a contest yet
2647607 whenever we got the phone call he was very excited about it
2647608 hell be known as the sheep boy for the rest of his life

2647610 i entered three this one wasnt my favorite one but they liked it
2647611 im happy that they do the contest its a great idea to promote the county
2647612 we felt that those three images really filled the bill as far as what we were asking people for
2647613 three boys in alameda park just having a grand time
2647614 we had fishing shots we got quite a few rodeo shots this year and a whole lot of kids playing which is wonderful
2647615 i did work as a professional actor after i got out of the marine corps in the 1970s
2647616 after i got married i kind of drifted away from it but kept my foot in the door for the next 30 years in amateur theater productions
2647617 when arthur saw me perform in the schools production of two gentlemen from verona he came up to me and said you are definitely an actor
2647618 he saw something in me and spent the next three years coaching me to this day i phone him once a week to discuss theater
2647619 people were telling me i had what it takes but the new york theater world is tough
2647620 thats why i decided to jump on my motorcycle and travel around the country looking for an acting job
2647621 i phoned the theater and told them id like to come to washington to try out
2647622 the tuesday after memorial day they granted me an audition the very next day they called back to say they wanted me to play the role of george
2647623 north strabane resident asks permission to erect wind turbine in yard
2647624 we had 650 children involved in summer programs including story times and the summer reading program and a field trip to phipps conservatory
2647625 libraries traditionally see an increase in usage when the economy is bad
2647626 i didnt want to work a dead end minimum wage job
2647627 but without any skills thats what i was looking at doing
2647628 i really wanted to go to school but i didnt know how i was going to afford it
2647629 pretty much everything ive gotten except for the studying which i had to do on my own was through the keys program
2647630 our students are all on some type of public assistance so they cant get to school if they dont have gas for their cars or food or day care for their kids
2647631 the students need to have a service plan which is what i help them develop and they have to turn in paperwork to us every week to show they are meeting their requirements
2647632 we do help the student secure grants and loans to pay for it
2647633 this program really was a way for me to earn all my prerequisites
2647634 its been really great things i didnt know were available to me ive gotten through keys
2647635 that is definitely part of the problem getting the word out that this exists
2647636 thats why we really want to get the word out if you really want to go to school if you want a degree come see us
2647637 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2647638 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman that we could all identify with
2647639 the support from this community from the county commissioners has been overwhelming
2647640 i think it speaks to the excitement we have generated here
2647641 for the 18 year olds who want to go away and experience life this isnt the program for them
2647642 but half of our students are older and they arent interested in living on a college campus for them this provides the opportunity to earn a bachelors degree without ever having to leave the area
2647643 starting gate provides low or no rent options for business owners for at least a year
2647644 the only caveat is if you take advantage of this you have to set up shop in lawrence county
2647645 once we have this building in place we can then do what community colleges do well which is workforce development
2647646 in the next five to 10 years i expect this will be a fully developed college campus
2647647 there is still a chance that we could have both grocery stores
2647648 we are not a full service grocery store but we are a full product grocery store and we offer very competitive prices especially in underserved communities
2647649 we should think about this as the long needed expansion and development of centre avenues business corridor
2647650 this is what the future of centre avenue should be
2647651 our goal is to encourage foot traffic that will bring about development in this area
2647652 i was born and raised in east liberty and i have seen how a grocery store can change a community look at what whole foods has done in east liberty
2647653 we are not whole foods but we have been operating in this region for many years now
2647654 10 or 15 years ago because this was a hard place
2647655 this was a chance to give people a sense of the decision we have to make and we are extremely excited that we even have a choice between two very good proposals
2647656 and if he was able to give financial support to a family who needed it he did
2647657 he didnt want to have to travel anymore he wanted to spend more time with us and give us a better life
2647658 it was a little bit of a rough ride for the first couple of years
2647659 it wasnt immediately successful we had a lot of lean years but i was just a little kid so i didnt know any better back then
2647660 whatever we were into and doing he was also very involved with
2647661 often young students tell me they want to make a splash
2647662 ill say well let me tell you what john chapman told me
2647663 he expected you to engage in intellectual conversation with him hed give you a list of books and ask you to tell him what you thought about them
2647664 he always made you feel you had something important to say
2647665 but he felt that with the war over what was the point of continuing to put his people in danger
2647666 if it was a drug store that went out of business we wouldnt investigate that
2647667 i think the call volume dropped so low they werent making any money
2647668 the powers that be whoever they are should give us some answers
2647669 there was never any defined leader maybe that was part of the problem
2647670 we were basically forced out of business there were greater forces at work against us
2647671 others have gone out of business but they always give us a plan
2647672 dieser platz war in etwa realistisch trotzdem sind wir traurig dass es nicht zu mehr gereicht hat
2647673 revolution is made of hardships we should never content ourselves with five minutes of enthusiasm at the moment china urgently needs three important things 1 because 95 percent of chinese are illiterate we must promote education 2 to be rich we must promote industrial enterprises and 3 to be strong we must promote physical education
2647674 at the time nobody went to school so how could we let you go to school
2647675 the important thing was not to lose any more structural integrity
2647676 its a thrill for us to have even a small impact on what someday could be a great attraction in the city
2647677 you should photograph lions in kenya you have the eye
2647678 i am with you alway even unto the end of the world
2647679 i am close to signing a deal to write a book but everyone should hold on i have lots of stories ive never told and they will all be in my book
2647680 my well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes
2647681 which also bears fruit and brings forth some an hundred fold some sixty some thirty
2647682 and when he sowed some fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up when any one hears the word of the kingdom and understands it not then comes the wicked one and catches away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the wayside
2647683 when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and understands it not then comes the wicked one and catches away that which was sown in his heart
2647684 if any man think that he knows anything he knows nothing yet as he ought to know
2647685 some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away he that received the seed into stony places the same is he which hears the word and anon with joy receives it yet has he not root in himself but endures for awhile for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended
2647686 this is the flesh at its fairest capable of coming so near to the kingdom of god and all the more manifesting its hopeless nature there is the unbroken rock behind that never yields to the word and gives it no lodgment and the class of hearers pictured here are born of the flesh only let things be outwardly favorable to profession it is plain that the number of these may multiply largely and may stick like dead leaves to a tree that has had no rough blast to shake them off but life is none the more in them
2647687 and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them he also that received seed among the thorns is he that hears the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becomes unfruitful
2647688 but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit he that received seed into the good ground is he that hears the word and understands it which also bears fruit and brings forth some an hundred fold some sixty some thirty
2647689 this is he in whom a divine work of grace has been wrought
2647690 whose heart has been made receptive by the operation of the holy spirit
2647691 the wind bloweth where it pleaseth so is every one that is born of the spirit
2647692 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
2647693 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god
2647694 that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul
2647695 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep
2647696 and the earth had become a desolate ruin and darkness was upon the face of the deep
2647697 and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
2647698 and god said let there be light and there was light
2647699 but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth
2647700 of judgment because the prince of this world is judged
2647701 the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him
2647702 and when he is come he will reprove or better
2647703 a certain man made a great supper and bade many
2647704 a certain man made a great supper and bade many
2647705 tell those which are bidden all things are ready come unto the marriage
2647706 to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready
2647707 bring in the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind
2647708 while many are looking forward to casting their votes in novembers presidential election the primary election on aug 26 is also critically important
2647709 the local state and national representatives chosen in this election will impact palm beach all voters must bring along a picture id with signature anderson said
2647710 the map will be placed in the delray beach public library to visually illustrate and promote delray beachs rich cultural diversity

2647715 nbcs decision to delay broadcasting the opening ceremonies by 12 hours sent people across the country to their computers to poke holes in nbcs technological wall by finding newsfeeds on foreign broadcasters web sites and by watching clips of the ceremonies on youtube and other sites in response nbc sent frantic requests to web sites asking them to take down the illicit clips and restrict authorized video to host countries as the four hour ceremony progressed a game of digital whack a mole took place network executives tried to regulate leaks on the web and shut down unauthorized video while viewers deftly traded new links on blogs and on the twitter site redirecting one another to coverage from say germany or a site with a grainy spanish language video stream as the first summer games of the broadband age commenced in china old network habits have never seemed so archaic or so irrelevant
2647716 upon hearing tragic news hitler decides to tweet his sadness only to learn its down
2647717 lol so what if you give most of it away
2647718 there are too many facts to be a simple coincidence
2647719 anyone who goes around predicting what is going to happen in thailand is completely crazy
2647720 urgent series of tests conducted at fort detrick maryland and elsewhere
2647721 so i asked how people should believe this given that theres no way to know where the information is coming from
2647722 his basic answer was that brian ross and abc news have reputations for being highly regarded journalistic outlets so we put our credibility behind the story and that should lead people to believe that this is credible
2647723 i dont know the answers to any of those questions
2647724 my main point is that we ought to know the answers to those questions and thats the only way we are going to know them through an investigation the striking fact about all this is that the anthrax attacker according to the government worked at the very same place the anonymous source came from which was fort detrick maybe it was a complete coincidence but it seems pretty significant to me that if a person from the same place where the perpetrator worked created a false story linking the attacks to something different its a very worthwhile reason for an investigation
2647725 i think first of all that this is a basic principal of journalism that if you get a story wrong you explain what happened that led to the bad reporting
2647726 thats what the new york times did to explain how they got those judy miller stories wrong when people get stories wrong the credibility of the journalistic outlet depends upon them explaining what happened if brian ross wants to say our sources acted in good faith they just got it wrong then he needs to explain the basis of that
2647727 at the very least abc should be working right now on some grand mea culpa along the lines of what the times did after the judith miller stories or even going back further to jayson blair
2647728 pretty much setting out not that we got this story wrong we know that but how we got it wrong what systemically allowed us to get this story so wrong and to flog it to the point that it was being used to embroil america in war i really think at the very least thats what they owe their viewers and themselves
2647729 now theres always a possibility that the sources were working in good faith that they were just supremely stupid or misinformed and got the story wrong
2647730 if thats the case it clouds the issue abc better be damn sure that these people were actually lying to them that they were specifically trying to mislead brian ross in the aims of furthering some sinister end before they can out them but i generally agree with the sentiment that investigative journalism is devoted to transparency and anonymity is a weapon for transparency it allows people with access to sensitive information to shield themselves from any backlash when a source uses that privilege of anonymity to push an agenda then i think a journalist is released from an obligation to protect that sources identity at all cost
2647731 its not a zero sum game where if i gave you bad information and therefore youre dead to me
2647732 i mean there can be a source that has given you five six seven things that have been reliable a trustworthy person youve gone to for info but if that person gives you bad intel one time does that negate everything else that that person gave you does that mean that they were acting maliciously here the trouble is that its very hard to prove intent its hard to show that youre being used
2647733 their initial conclusion based on microscopic examination was a brown substance that initially was reported as bentonite
2647734 we went back immediately after the white house told us it was not the case we were told after further chemical analysis it was determined it was a silica but not bentonite something they had never seen before but had a brownish color
2647735 if it was ivins i would report that in a second
2647736 was accurate at that point in their point of view
2647737 they are trying to turn 2008 into a year of mourning for china
2647738 i admit that we face a severe campaign because i know that these people will not lose their momentum
2647739 with the special background of the eve of the beijing olympic games hostile forces at home and abroad will surely act like cornered mad dogs and step up their terror and sabotage activities
2647740 its very confusing and we really dont know if its 100 safe
2647741 im not against vaccines but i dont want to do anything that would harm my daughter
2647742 we dont know if it will make a difference in the ultimate rates of cancer
2647743 the jury is still out on how much benefit were actually going to get with this vaccine
2647744 the crux of it is that we know how to prevent cervical cancer
2647745 one of the key questions is whether this huge outlay of money for the vaccine is a better strategy than reaching out to the women who arent getting pap tests and follow ups
2647746 even though it guards against two hpv strains the other hpv types need to be taken into account
2647747 it will take a long time before we know the true efficacy of the vaccine
2647748 if we vaccinate every single 12 year old it should reduce by half the number of cervical cancers in the next 35 years
2647749 the secretary general is alarmed by the escalation of hostilities in georgia which have resulted in large numbers of casualties and massive destruction in south ossetia and other regions of georgia
2647750 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions georgia faces a humanitarian catastrophe
2647751 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2647752 something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation
2647753 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2647754 man you have a very interesting page i was raised strict protestant but not really going anywhere now ive been tetering on the fence as to orientation i guess im just scared to let anyone know i would really love to talk with you sometime though seems like you could give me some advice give me a call phone number ill be up for a while if you want to call tonight hey thanks man id appreciate it
2647755 advice no i dont have anything i could give you thats worth hearing i can tell you that 1 your friends that are christian will most likely abandon you 2 your strict family will most likely do the same 3 youll be called a fag queer and that youll burn in hell 4 youll be forbidden to be around children 5 youll wish you never came out of the closet to begin with p s those christians aint worth the trouble and neither is your family if youre happy being with a man do it youre already half dead sorry if that sounded blunt but itll probly hit a nerve you didnt think you had before and itll be good use
2647756 dont give so much of a fuck about others and their feelings issues situations amp etc
2647757 no but i tend to fall hard just cuz likable people are so rare
2647758 knowing that its going where it will one day get to is what gets me through the day
2647759 can you look over there behind you on the wall and tell me what time it is
2647760 oh my josh its 10 33 and i dont have my glasses on
2647761 he doesnt have a house and we have a computer
2647762 what we want to do in this review is to begin to systematically and carefully review all of these neglected works
2647763 we really need to begin to celebrate our authors more and to follow edgars lead in becoming sensitive to the common themes
2647764 i want a boyfriend whos caring and sensitive but they already have boyfriends

2647767 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2647768 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2647769 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2647770 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2647771 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2647772 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2647773 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2647774 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2647775 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2647776 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2647777 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2647778 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2647779 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2647780 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2647781 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2647782 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2647783 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2647784 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2647785 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2647786 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2647787 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2647788 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2647789 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2647790 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2647791 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2647792 to chain you up and take you with me like they did you in africa
2647793 buyers are sitting on the sidelines trying to figure out whats going on
2647794 pennsylvania is basically a democrat leaning state a democrat really needs to have it if a republican wins it i think it is very likely that the republican wins the election nationally
2647795 a state that leans democrat in a climate in which the republican brand name is at a significant disadvantage
2647796 no doubt that pennsylvania is the only big state in the northeast that is still open to a republican
2647797 still my sense is that pennsylvania could only generously be called a toss up right now i think more correctly it is very light blue leaning to obama
2647798 obama will have to fall flat for pennsylvania to go republican in 2008 the african american vote is going to be way up and 95 97 percent for obama it will be tough for mccain to make up enough ground in the philly ring counties or the more rural parts of the state in the west but well see
2647799 ridge might just be able to deliver the state to mccain though it wouldnt be a slam dunk even then
2647800 most observers dont think ridge is going to be picked because of his pro choice position but with mccain the maverick you never really know
2647801 i expect both candidates to be spending a lot of time in pennsylvania this fall
2647802 this state is going to be critical because of the number of electoral votes at stake
2647803 its going to take a lot of hard work and commitment but senator obama has shown hes prepared to do that

2647836 there are times the leadoff walks made the inning a little bit more difficult for him but he made a lot of good pitches

2647846 sometimes your emotions get the best of you and you might do something irrational out there
2647847 for awhile everyone was saying this is a temporary blip a change because of dissatisfaction with the iraq war but its more permanent

2647850 we think we have just about turned the corner in new hampshire and become the dominant political party thanks to candidates at the national level but also candidates here like john lynch and jeanne shaheen
2647851 were spending 14 to 16 hours a day identifying voters were absolutely not taking anything for granted
2647852 one of the lessons i learned from 2006 is that there is no such thing as a safe seat anymore
2647853 theres this arc in news coverage about new hampshire becoming a competitive state but its always been competitive the tide is always moving
2647854 basically democrats and republican are at parity in new hampshire now

2647868 how could we make our product even more difficult and frustrating to adopt

2647874 we had the update this morning from them were obviously delighted and very much welcome the decision theyve taken today to continue here at the olympic games
2647875 my friends and i actually believed it was fixed but i said hey im sending in my 10 donation anyway
2647876 my wife and i were away from home and i forgot about the drawing she checked the answering machine and told me there was a guy on there who said id been picked for an elk license i just dropped to my knees i couldnt believe it i can tell anyone now that its not fixed
2647877 the 10 is almost no cost compared to the experience
2647878 our whole family and 13 friends got to participate that memory will carry through forever for all of us
2647879 people sometimes see the elk that are habituated to people around the viewing sites and they think the hunt is easy
2647880 but i liken the situation to yellowstone national park and to people visiting there concluding that all elk in wyoming and montana are easily approached the winslow hill viewing area is in the 7 square mile no hunt zone but when you get in the back country the elk are very different i ride horses in these areas and when you ride up on elk they move off very quickly just like deer
2647881 without a doubt the elk license drawing is our biggest draw its the one thing that everyone wants to be in the crowd for and maybe hear their name drawn
2647882 i believe that every year weve had someone present whose name was drawn for a license its very exciting
2647883 though i dont understand you billy i hope you dont change

2647906 that whole year at kiski was a humbling experience for me
2647907 it gave me another year to mature mentally and physically and to gain some weight i got a chance to meet a lot of nice people and it taught me how to get prepared for college

2647940 i am pretty happy about that that was a pretty emotional race today
2647941 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through i wasnt really happy to turn and see all three of us together at the 200 metres point
2647942 i wasnt really comfortable with that close a race i normally have more of a gap

2647962 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2647963 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys
2647964 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
2647965 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball
2647966 my own daughter threatened to disown me she said i will lose face so i will sever our relationship you must remember that at the time hip hop was considered something poor people or street people would perform

2647977 the share of food fuel and heating in our budgets is much higher than in more developed countries and its precisely those goods whose prices have risen most

2647983 the virus writers dont need me they are not going to take my course
2647984 you dont have to write a virus to understand them and how to detect them
2647985 the time spent to write a virus is worthless any student at a college beyond the first few courses who cant write a virus probably shouldnt be there because its not a difficult algorithm to write
2647986 sure anti virus companies are doing something about the problem but its kind of arrogant for them to say its up to them it should be opened up to the academic world
2647987 computer professionals know little or nothing with regard to malware it would be as if a physician knew as much about microbiology as the average person on the street that would be unacceptable imagine if doctors deferred all decisions to pharmaceutical companies but thats what security professionals do with malware
2647988 if he thinks socializing our programs is the way to go fine but that still doesnt justify writing viruses
2647989 hes completely right it people dont know enough about security but teaching them how to write a virus doesnt help them learn about it

2648023 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2648024 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2648025 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2648026 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2648027 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2648028 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2648029 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2648030 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2648031 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2648032 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be

2648040 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks ms henton said
2648041 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a us110 130 band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2648042 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand chatham house said in a gloomy report entitled the
2648043 given recent price experience a spike in excess of us200 per barrel is not infeasible
2648044 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend mr jessop said
2648045 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2648046 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three percent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2648047 ever accelerating demand for commodities from emerging economies could not be taken for granted

2648073 jeane was very clear with me that if she was ever found dead of an apparent suicide i was to make sure that all the evidence was publicly disseminated so that it could be independently evaluated
2648074 there were people passing almost every five minutes the question is how in that time could it be possible with so many people coming and going that no one saw someone coming in through the window without being seen we have concluded this theory is very inconsistent

2648098 gt bloomfields amanda moreland gets in an early morning run at mendon ponds park last week
2648099 ive been on the varsity team since eighth grade and have learned you need to run everyday during the summer
2648100 cross country isnt like most sports where you can just show up at the first day of practice if you dont dedicate yourself to the sport youre going to feel it everywhere in your body
2648101 quite often people come out for the sport for casual reasons which is fine but they end up finding themselves in trouble because just three weeks of running before your first meet isnt enough
2648102 i dedicate about 65 percent of my summer to running
2648103 ive been training six days a week this entire summer
2648104 in addition to my 35 or more miles per week running i swim and hike
2648105 but i feel that placing in the top five is in my reach
2648106 getting the mental mindset to run a long distance at a strong pace is hard
2648107 after two miles you just have to hold on and fight cramps its a struggle to move your arms and power through the ups and downs of the course
2648108 whats so great about this sport is that everyone gets to play and not have to worry about playing time
2648109 these guys dont get the same glory as other sports because there are no stands for people to sit in and watch
2648110 but my athletes have told me how their friends on other sports teams talk of how much running we do
2648111 i tried out for the soccer team in my freshman year and was cut
2648112 it turned out to be the best thing that has ever happened to me cross country is so hard which makes it so rewarding people always think they cant do it i try to tell them that it is easier than it looks which is a lie but most people are still afraid of the pain they might endure
2648113 having to run three miles as hard as you can is no walk in the park
2648114 one of the worst meets ive seen was in st lawrence when it was hailing
2648115 the mud was up to the athletes shins but its like a right of passage for them they take the mud and smear it on their faces
2648116 one of my athletes she was new asked if the meet was going to be canceled
2648117 the veterans just looked at her and laughed and informed her that cross country runs in all weather
2648118 in 2000 we had a meet in auburn with a hill you couldnt even run up
2648119 there was also a meet in weedsport about two years ago with a hill so steep kids were sloshing sliding and slipping all over
2648120 most people that come to our course dread running the hill especially when conditions are poor
2648121 a lot of people have to walk up it because there isnt any traction
2648122 the weather is the most fun part the colder the better i love running in the rain wind and mud its too bad that we cant make cross country more like it is in europe with the obstacles
2648123 when its colder out you have to use more mental energy which makes it more rewarding to persevere
2648124 probably the worst meet ive ever run in was my sophomore year at flcc for the league championship flcc was basically washed out and you could barely make it up the hill
2648125 even though your chest feels like its going to explode and your legs feel like cement it is a very rewarding feeling
2648126 the sport in general is actually very fun and the feeling of being successful after a race is so great
2648127 only one instance can have the volume mounted at any given time
2648128 try the macbook air and see if it works for me
2648129 miss jane kromer took away most of the laurels in the hunter events
2648130 how would gt gt you like me to shove this pipe down your fuckin throat
2648131 the virus writers dont need me they are not going to take my course
2648132 you dont have to write a virus to understand them and how to detect them
2648133 the time spent to write a virus is worthless any student at a college beyond the first few courses who cant write a virus probably shouldnt be there because its not a difficult algorithm to write
2648134 sure anti virus companies are doing something about the problem but its kind of arrogant for them to say its up to them it should be opened up to the academic world
2648135 computer professionals know little or nothing with regard to malware it would be as if a physician knew as much about microbiology as the average person on the street that would be unacceptable imagine if doctors deferred all decisions to pharmaceutical companies but thats what security professionals do with malware
2648136 if he thinks socializing our programs is the way to go fine but that still doesnt justify writing viruses
2648137 hes completely right it people dont know enough about security but teaching them how to write a virus doesnt help them learn about it
2648138 but keep in mind you know john edwards did not order that anyone be tortured he did not violate the geneva convention he did not forge a document to lead us into a war he cheated on his wife
2648139 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2648140 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2648141 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2648142 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2648143 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private

2648154 political circus a three ring reflection on the 2008 election campaigns
2648155 these artifacts indicate the resentment of some quarters of american society against any sharing of power with non traditional groups as well as a retrenchment and continuing reinvention of malicious stereotypes based on sex race religion age sexual preference and gender
2648156 it is essential to participate in and extend a public airing and discussion of these trends

2648164 they will continue participating in the games this reflects the olympic spirit and the value of the games the ioc says it is the right decision
2648165 they are participating in sport against whichever team they meet they are here to stay and to compete at the olympics
2648166 the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for
2648167 i wanted to be prepared not flying back from beijing and starting a major five days later
2648168 i have been to the olympics once that made my decision easier
2648169 mardys a good player but i didnt let him do anything today
2648170 im so happy to be in my first hardcourt final id love to win another title
2648171 he was tough that was more to do with it than anything else
2648172 success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which one has overcome while trying to succeed
2648173 not anymore though its the same thing with ron people hear stuff about ron and think im not going near ron people hear about queensbridge and say im not going out there but when you get out there like i said about ron when you actually get to know him its different its a great place same with him hes a great person theyre going to love him in houston
2648174 thats not going to change im never going to change my culture
2648175 i lived in a ghetto but am i ghetto is ron ghetto he was born and raised in the projects but he never got involved with all the negative stuff
2648176 it was not far from him but the way he was raised the house was one thing and what happened in the streets was another thing there were guns some bullets came into the house twice i found the bullet holes
2648177 he never was in trouble in queensbridge the neighborhood is rough people did what they did that doesnt mean you have to get caught up with it i dont drink i dont smoke it was never a temptation for me the type of person ron is the way he grew up i dont think the stuff outside affected him
2648178 as long as it wasnt raining so hard you couldnt see ron and his father would be at queensbridge shooting hoops it could be snowing his father would shovel and his little brother would be rebounding feeding him the ball
2648179 people dont know how hard ron worked to get where he is right now
2648180 they think he is this loose cannon guy goes to the beat of his own drum and doesnt pay attention to the rules youve heard all these things its really not true ron where he came from to get to the nba is a dramatic story
2648181 ron was on his own a lot he was a soldier he could have quit many times but he had it in his heart he knew basketball was going to be his out
2648182 the image that he has to me hes not like that at all
2648183 he brought most of the baggage on himself but he has a pure heart hes not a bad guy
2648184 i was into basketball i was in vietnam i was very against drugs in the community thats how this started i fought the drug dealers i go to mass every day i tried to pull ron closer to god and he was ron will give you the shirt off his back hes a great human being i kept ron going to church every day i believed if he gets closer to god i dont have to worry about him
2648185 now hes married hes a great father always doing something with his children always giving back to his community
2648186 it drives him he is proud not of getting out of queensbridge but of being from there his body might have left but his mind and his heart are still there
2648187 i think often times they look at the usual suspects
2648188 i think dalton jones was thinking this is a dangerous person and whether he did it or whether he didnt im going to get him off the street
2648189 reflect that lorden is unable to fairly and reliably describe the circumstances of the offense
2648190 we have the most data on capital and homicide convictions because they are the most high profile
2648191 so we have no idea how many wrongful convictions there are in larceny cases or assault cases or any other because nobody is paying any attention to those
2648192 the governments use of criminal informants is largely secretive unregulated and unaccountable
2648193 this lack of oversight and quality control leads to wrongful convictions more crime disrespect for the law and sometimes even official corruption

2648259 ive been wanting to do this for a long time
2648260 i had blood coming out of my nose my leg was all thrashed up

2648268 june 1986 i was 9 years old at the time and had just received my introduction to the van halen juggernaut via the 5150 album needless to say it was quite the eye opening experience especially from a musicians point of view i had just started playing drums at this time as well to this day if i am asked who my number one influence is regarding drumming i say eddie van halen yes i know how to play guitar and yes at one point i did own a wolfgang eds signature line of guitars from when he was affiliated with peavey but theres no way i can play half as good not even a quarter as good as ed and since i cannot play anywhere near eds level drunk or sober i decided to take the next best approach paint a computer case like his famous frankenstrat guitar
2648269 van halen had loads of cash to get the guitars he wanted anytime he wanted so my question to you is how much money have you spent so far on this project
2648270 i dont have an exact figure but im pretty sure that it is under 100 usd i got the case for free bought some plexiglass leds a grab bag from paulie last year and a few other odds and ends now if you figure in the equipment that ive bought over the last year the jigsaw the scrollsaw the belt sander et al then the price jumps to well over 300 usd but since hardware such as this will be used not only for other mods but for other endeavors as well i dont see the need to incorporate these expenses into the build expenses
2648271 of course this is a modding website its pretty much required that i ask this next question what did this box used to be before you started this project
2648272 hey i didnt know you can put a pc into that
2648273 all in all swiftech has made an awesome kit with this one they really out did themselves even on 5 volts though the fans can be a little noisy i hope to be replacing them with some quieter ones also be careful about what screws you use to mount the fans there are 3 types and they are all almost the same size 1 will be slightly short and the other will puncture the rad which i almost did

2648350 so i did look at it and it had a lot of the features we had hoped for and dreamed of we all agreed that it was a nice building in a good location with the accessibility and functionality we needed

2648377 when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir this note was a promise that all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned

2648384 sure i should have voted for it but it was not for my personal gain that i did not do so my constituents needed me to do things i knew or should have known were wrong just to stay in office where i could continue to do them the most good in this manner
2648385 that is what i have often chosen personally to do and have done whatever the blows which i have endured on such account i could never regret that i acted so i refused and still refuse thus to play the more popular classically tragic role in life
2648386 that goes against everything i have been taught to believe
2648387 i trust my husband and therefore i could never believe
2648388 if you were right everything i have been taught about scientific method in my university would have had to have been wrong

2648422 oh no he not only shagged another woman while his wife was sick but he didnt use birth control either
2648423 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen

2648431 middle children tend to have lower self esteem than first or last borns perhaps because parents are busy with the other kids
2648432 kids who think they dont get enough attention may feel down or defeated so tack on extra time for the middle
2648433 if youre running to the supermarket ask your middle child to come along
2648434 remember healthy kids dont make excuses so they can skip trips to theme parks or sleepovers
2648435 dabbling in risky behavior is part of being a teen
2648436 so ask questions and dont shy away from any they may ask peer pressure is real but parents have a huge protective influence too
2648437 this is the first study and a very large one linking these commonly consumed products to this common disorder
2648438 we find that if you have high consumption of fructose your gout risk is doubled and that is due to easily available sugary beverages
2648439 most of us think of purine rich foods as those that increase gout risk because they feed directly into the uric acid pathway certainly fructose processed by the liver can affect that pathway but this is not what we usually think of
2648440 but most doctors would agree that high fructose carbonated beverages dont have any nutritional benefit you dont want to be pouring high fructose soft drinks into your body
2648441 when it occurs you suffer really a lot for a week to two weeks
2648442 it is very severe pain just putting your bed sheet on the joint hurts gout causes intense swelling and pain one of the worst pains you can suffer
2648443 the most important risk factor for whether a person develops gout or not is family history
2648444 all of the research that has been conducted on gout over the last century or so has shown that foods and beverages high in purines such as alcoholic beverages beer gravies and certain kinds of meat are strongly linked to development of gout soft drinks dont have that in them
2648445 we find a similar level of increased gout risk from apples and oranges as from sweetened soft drinks but the caution is misplaced here because these fruits offer benefits against other major disorders such as diabetes and certain cancers
2648446 there may be certain limited situations such as treatment resistant severe gout where reducing all sources of fructose may be of use but overall fruits are beneficial

2648457 i dont think any world class athletes interested in keeping their bodies in peak condition welcome the thought of breathing that filthy air for two weeks
2648458 we realize it may be difficult for the rest of the world to understand especially young countries like the united states but when a culture has been cultivated for thousands of years it gains a power of its own our ancient traditions literally blanket the land when the incense smoke from millions of buddhist and taoist chants rises to join with dust blown from the armor of the vast terra cotta armies it gathers in the skies to protect the chinese people from invasion this is what you see not your so called smog
2648459 notice how it balances harmoniously with the mountains rivers and roads in accordance with the principles of feng shui this is no accident it shelters the jade dragons as they fly among people endowing them with luck and prosperity
2648460 our rain is not laced with acid as it is in the west it is infused with the sublimated essence of chi gung practicing hermits and the elixir of the eight immortals such miraculous qualities explain why the water here is in high demand we look forward to several world records being broken by athletes swimming and diving through the rarified tears of the goddess of mercy guan yin
2648461 in fact the oriental mystique should allow athletes in all events to perform super human feats surely people from around the world have watched in awe as chinese actors and martial artists have flown effortlessly through the air and fought for hours on a slender stalk of green bamboo these movements are not the results of wires or trick photography they are a natural ability granted to all who walk upon this land that our great nation would invite outsiders to share in our spectacular gift is truly a sign of our benevolence
2648462 however we cannot be absolutely be certain that chinese culture will not reject the olympics boxing wrestling and even the accursed fighting style of those who perpetrated unspeakable crimes upon this land judo are recognized events meanwhile the noble art of wu shu is denied a chance at any medals the spirits of venerable shao lin monks may not look favorably upon this that synchronized swimmers will take to the stadium while tai chi masters remain in the city parks may ultimately unleash the mischief of the monkey king we fear we have tried to appease the shadows of our glorious past by petitioning the olympic committee to allow the nunchaku as a viable apparatus in rhythmic gymnastics but even this small gesture has been rejected without compromise
2648463 we have done and will continue to do everything in our powers to ensure the world of an olympics of extraordinary magnitude the legacy of the yellow emperor lives on in the yellow skies above beijing

2648470 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

2648476 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
2648477 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
2648478 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
2648479 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
2648480 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
2648481 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
2648482 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
2648483 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
2648484 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
2648485 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

2648490 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
2648491 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
2648492 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

2648496 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit

2648499 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
2648500 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

2648519 i feel sad seeing the situation in the country the present situation is quite contrary to what we had imagined for the country while walking on the path shown by mahatma gandhi today we can see corruption everywhere
2648520 our country is great people follow different religions and there are all kinds of people so there is bound be some difference of opinion but on the whole our country is on the path of progress i am satisfied
2648521 i have already created a record of playing the mridangam non stop for 101 hours i have the confidence of still bettering this record
2648522 nobody in the music field has ever attempted this type of record of paying mridangam non stop for 101 hours and above whats more interesting is that he ramakrishnan himself is now attempting to break his earlier record which in itself is a unique attempt
2648523 though it took the authorities bit long to get electricity to khattapani it is not the fault of administration only we tried our best to get electricity here but it took us sometime

2648527 we come up against it quite a lot that is why we wear a bikini because it is hot out there most of the time fox news quoted cook the first female beach volleyballer to go to four olympic games as saying
2648528 i really enjoy indoor volleyball still and i love watching it but beach volleyball feels like me being outside it is a lot more relaxed you interact with other teams a lot more barnett said
2648529 eighteen months isnt very long for a beach volleyball team there is a lot of chemistry and understanding of each other what buttons to press and what not to press cook said
2648530 to understand each other is what it is all about
2648531 but with tamsins height at the net she is 193cm and her power and my experience and ability to frustrate teams and put the ball where they are not hopefully it will be a good combination

2648535 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2648536 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation

2648538 we love india it is second time we have been back here we heard about the boat race its so famous

2648542 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2648543 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2648544 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2648545 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2648546 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2648547 it hurt a lot more than i thought it would

2648553 it is not until the quiet moment when quasimodo speaks with esmeralda now safely living in the bell tower we see how tortured a soul he really is mr laughtons ability to suspend our belief under what must have been pounds of makeup is extraordinary and we see through the disfigured body and the grotesque face to the heart of this unhappy young man her presence brings him great happiness and yet he confesses until he saw her he did not know how truly ugly he was she breaks his heart just by being someone so far above him in perfection how universal in this gut wrenching emotion among the handicapped the different the outcasts laughton captures it cruelly perfectly

2648567 there are many issues that are important to the voters and as candidates it is imperative that alice kryzan jack davis and jon powers let voters know where we stand on each issue that is important to them
2648568 the fact that jack davis is bankrolling his campaign with money he made from exxon shows how out of touch he is with everyday western new yorkers
2648569 mr powers deliberately exaggerates mr davis oil holdings conceals his own and also fails to disclose that he has accepted campaign contributions from oil and energy lobbyists
2648570 to attack davis oil returns is simply childish and flies in the face of reality
2648571 but i truly dont think its the same thing the scale of profit is so so drastically different for them to nitpick this one little thing its silly

2648579 it sets the example and you move from there every dollar counts
2648580 with this going around and being very visible youll likely get a county legislator to step up and get the process going
2648581 i think it is something we should explore and consider
2648582 at this point in time we need to determine how we should implement a reduction the question is what level of representation is optimum
2648583 we are committed to reducing the size of government in niagara county
2648584 the real meat and potato issue and the real cost savings are in consolidating services and consolidating smaller governments and school districts

2648602 theres no funding for construction were waiting until the residential market turns around
2648603 we built too fast too long then all of a sudden the bottom fell out
2648604 you cant sustain that it was just like the dot com crash everything goes in cycles
2648605 it was crazy we were hiring consultants to help us developers wanting everything done in five minutes a lot of them overextended and went belly up
2648606 we believe its the most important housing legislation to ever pass congress
2648607 we think it will do a lot to give people confidence in the market and start back on a buying trend
2648608 we will see more and more building permits being pulled
2648609 the rate of descent has certainly changed weve got to be nearing that point

2648619 hay que estar en estos momentos lo m s cerrados posibles
2648620 no es un buen resultado era important sima la victoria hubo buen esfuerzo pero creo que nos falta ritmo y afinar algunas cosas ahorita seguimos analizaremos los partidos y veremos qu est pasando para seguir adelante se siente que vamos caminando pero nos falta ritmo
2648621 no tenemos el ritmo del torneo pasado al principio pero tambi n es normal en un inicio de torneo estamos concientes que lo importante es en la recata final
2648622 hay que estar en estos momentos lo m s cerrados posibles para analizar y tratar de resolver en ese sentido actitud s siento que vamos mejorando pero para completar lo que se trabaja nos est faltando manejo y no estamos llegando perfectamente
2648623 hubo muchos cambios de esquema del monterrey y eso gener que tomaran m s el bal n y posesi n del mismo nosotros no supimos tener calma nos cost
2648624 le dimos el bal n a monterrey ya estaba planeado hab amos dicho que se lo bamos a dar 50 metros y la idea era poder quitarles el bal n en mitad de cancha para poder salir con beto medina y santana sergio de una manera r pida desafortunadamente creo que inclusive ellos en el momento que se comenzaban a desesperar fue que tuvieron esa jugada del empate esta vez les regalamos el bal n como nunca lo hacemos pero esta vez lo hicimos pensando en sorprenderlos de esta manera
2648625 el gol fue producto de una jugada bien elaborada por parte de ellos donde no puedo criticar a mi defensa hay que darle el justo valor y fue el empate no me preocupa porque creo que ahora en 80 minutos el equipo estuvo muy concentrado con buen manejo de la pelota
2648626 le veo que tuvimos mucha ganancia en este partido ya que al equipo lo veo ya en el cien por ciento de su capacidad y que le veo m s cosas positivas que negativas si bien es cierto que el empate no es nada agradable creo que es lo justo porque monterrey tambi n hizo lo necesario para empatarlo y nuestro pecado fue el no haber metido el dos a cero cuando pudimos
2648627 empez a trabajar de una manera inteligente el partido de tal forma que pudimos estar al frente del marcador despu s del uno a cero el equipo tuvo buena posesi n lo vi concentrado aplicado por momentos hicimos desesperar a monterrey al final de cuentas en los ltimos 15 minutos provocaron opciones de gol de las cuales la mayor parte de ellas excepto la jugada del gol es de jugadas individuales que hay que valorar a la parte individual que tiene ellos que es muy importante mi equipo estuvo muy concentrado a excepci n de esa jugada en la que viene el gol
2648628 fue un partido de ida y vuelta donde no pudimos aprovechar una que otra clara de gol y nos empataron a ltimo me dijo que me pusiera enfrente de los dos contenciones creo que debimos haber tenido m s el bal n y retenerlo y no prest rselo a ellos
2648629 hay muchos detalles que se tienen que platicar en la semana estoy molesto por la manera en que nos est n empatando los partidos estos puntos son los que vamos a necesitar al ltimo y no podemos desaprovecharlos
2648630 nunca nos preocupamos por lo que hagan ellos s lo ten amos que tener el bal n en esas jugadas tenemos que tener m s atenci n m s concentraci n y estar muy atentos porque nos han costado puntos no son enga osos y las estad sticas est n ah dos puntos de nueve posibles
2648631 delray beach needs h o p e because of the sheer number of families in jeopardy of losing their homes
2648632 we must now work together to minimize foreclosures by being proactive assisting homeowners and lenders to develop possible remedies has a positive effect
2648633 florida families have been disproportionately hard hit by the mortgage meltdown
2648634 unfortunately the outlook is not improving many experts believe the impending resetting of numerous variable loans will trigger yet another wave of foreclosures i look forward to working with the task force to develop solutions that will keep the families in their homes
2648635 the central bank is concerned about the reports of use of leverage by individuals and small businesses in real estate transactions there are talks of a tightening of regulations
2648636 there could be cases where individuals are over leveraging we support initiatives such as a credit bureau and finer regulations to curb such eventualities
2648637 we expect a further acceleration in the uaes money supply growth in 2008 as real interest rates remain strongly negative
2648638 investigations by dpe revealed that the prices of fish have only gone up at the abu dhabi cooperative society adcs where the fish outlet is leased to a private investor who is committed to pay adcs 10 to 20 per cent
2648639 for instance the price of a five kg pack of pakistani basmati rice in july was dh37 95 to dh42 at fatima supermarket while in other outlets it was as high as dh62
2648640 the department verified with abu dhabi national foodstuff company foodco the suppliers price which was dh35 60 and accordingly abu dhabi cooperative society was approached and revised the prices down from dh62 to dh42 5

2648643 um grande n mero de feridos e a destrui o em massa na oss tia do sul e outras regi es
2648644 hice lo que se me pidi en el primer tiempo me sent bien trat de recuperar el bal n y de tenerlo lo que me pidi el t cnico y en el segundo tiempo por un descuido por una desconcentraci n es como cae el gol
2648645 creo que por una desconcentraci n nos cae el gol hay que mejorar en eso y tener m s el bal n y cuidar el marcador estoy buscando la titularidad y nosotros ten amos el bal n y todo estaba controlado y si se me da la oportunidad la voy a aprovechar para lo que venga
2648646 venimos trabajando bien s lo que no caen los goles pero estamos tranquilos y s que vendr n los resultados el partido estuvo peleado en la media cancha y yo no tuve tantos disparos como hubiera querido s lo uno o dos y falta m s entendimiento con los delanteros que es lo que se necesita
2648647 we see gizzard shad die off sporadically around the state during these hot spells

2648654 i was watching television once and i swear to you i could not even hear the narrative the people speaking
2648655 but what im trying to do now is become compliant with what the planning staff recognizes is the standard on the lake
2648656 im trying to prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that i am never in violation because i have no fear at all that i have a problem
2648657 i lived 20 years in manhattan i know what noise is
2648658 this is unacceptable all i want to do is protect the environment here for everybody

2648663 its been great to have him walk around with me and that was really a breakthrough tournament
2648664 to be in contention to win a tournament and almost pull it off means a lot to me and my dad considering a couple of years ago he almost died
2648665 it sure is nice that weve been able to spend some good time together and hes been able to watch me play some good golf he always wanted me to play well and succeed and maybe get on the pga tour and win some tournaments he worked hard for it for me to get there
2648666 i cant wait to play in that one i got a sponsors exemption there in 2005 i played poorly missing the cut
2648667 but im looking forward to it im really happy that i got that 2005 opportunity i appreciate it i got to play in the tournament and i got to practice during a bunch of rounds there so i know the course fairly well just to have that experience should help me out playing the tournament this year
2648668 im really excited its been a lot of years of grinding and a lot of hard work
2648669 a lot of people helped me out along the way my parents my brother my wife has been really supportive its been a real team effort
2648670 estoy contento porque creo que al no recibir gol hoy demostramos una cierta mejor a en la l nea y bueno si adem s puedes aportar arriba algo que no es muy com n la felicidad es doble y esta victoria cae muy bien antes de nuestro viaje
2648671 hace un rato que no met a un gol se siente muy bien porque era el que nos pon a en el marcador pero m s all de eso me tiene contento que conseguimos la victoria ante un rival de grupo
2648672 la realidad es que este partido fue muy luchado en todos los sectores de la cancha es cierto que los balones cayeron en bal n parado pero tuvimos otras oportunidades en las que se pudo haber marcado pero no se pudo tuvimos variantes y por instantes manejamos bien el bal n
2648673 a este partido hay que tomarle una gran lectura creo que independientemente del marcador en ning n momento cruz azul pas por encima de nosotros s lo nos ganaron en dos jugadas en las que tuvimos errores en la defensiva as como tambi n debo reconocer que nos falt agresividad en el ataque pues en unos momentos no apoyamos lo suficiente a luis sandoval y robert de pinho que termin por ser factor en contra para rescatar un mejor resultado
2648674 no podemos decir que nos vamos tranquilos con esta derrota a pesar de que el rival no demostr que fue sumamente superior en cuestiones t cticas pues son tres puntos menos que nos arrebata el l derato de grupo y sobre todo que nos afecta para cumplir con nuestra principal meta que es sumar en al tabla porcentual
2648675 desde ma ana hay que olvidar los lamentos hay que tomar este marcador como una experiencia m s para mejorar y recuperar en las pr ximas semanas el liderato del grupo m s complicado y competitivo del torneo
2648676 cruz azul tuvo un gran m rito por manejar el juego
2648677 nos vamos muy tristes por la forma en la que perdimos creo que durante todo el partido demostramos que quer amos rescatar un mejor resultado sin embargo el rival supo aprovechar dos jugadas para que se quedaran con el triunfo
2648678 primero que nada debo reconocer que en la defensa cometimos errores que no nos pueden pasar por el simple hecho de que no podemos descuidar a ning n jugador dentro del rea y m s siendo una jugada a bal n parado aunque tambi n no podemos demeritar el gran esfuerzo que se hizo durante los noventa minutos para mejorar el marcador desde el primer gol en contra
2648679 cruz azul tuvo un gran m rito en manejar el juego a su estilo y como tal fue digno de afianzarse los tres puntos ahora es cuesti n de retomar lo antes posible el buen paso que mostramos en las jornadas anteriores y seguir en la lucha por los primeros lugares y sobre todo sumar para el no descenso
2648680 i drove a cab in detroit but watkins glen worried me a lot more
2648681 a lot of these guys have no clue what theyre doing out there especially when they see a right turn
2648682 nascar drivers throughout the last couple years im going to go back even as far as 10 years theyve started to put a lot of effort into their road racing because its two of the 36 races
2648683 and if you run the nationwide car as well it could be four
2648684 so theres a lot of good road racers i mean mark martin has been a phenomenal road racer for as long as i can remember i teamed up with him in the late 80s we won the 24 hours of daytona together look at whats happened the last eight years in cup races its been a nascar regular thats won all these races
2648685 the biggest thing on the oval is you know back off early get it into the corner then get back on the gas
2648686 its similar to how i run the road races as well i try to roll the middle as fast as i can and i think you know thats helped me on the road courses
2648687 but you know the short ovals i normally run pretty good at so it seems like that works there too
2648688 its no secret that i really dont like road courses
2648689 watkins glen is a little faster and flatter than infineon raceway but i grew up watching racing on ovals and not road courses
2648690 estoy contento porque creo que al no recibir gol hoy demostramos una cierta mejor a en la l nea y bueno si adem s puedes aportar arriba algo que no es muy com n la felicidad es doble y esta victoria cae muy bien antes de nuestro viaje
2648691 hace un rato que no met a un gol se siente muy bien porque era el que nos pon a en el marcador pero m s all de eso me tiene contento que conseguimos la victoria ante un rival de grupo
2648692 la realidad es que este partido fue muy luchado en todos los sectores de la cancha es cierto que los balones cayeron en bal n parado pero tuvimos otras oportunidades en las que se pudo haber marcado pero no se pudo tuvimos variantes y por instantes manejamos bien el bal n
2648693 espectacular mi equipo creo que hab a que pasar muchas veces este partido para que sepan lo que es jugar al futbol espectacular hac a tiempo que no ve a a un equipo jugar de un manera al toque triangular llegar lamentablemente y por lo menos en los varios partidos que llevo en monterrey desde el campeonato anterior y hoy creo que decisiones arbitrales muy pero muy que perjudican a monterrey y no viene de ahora se los dije a los directivos si me remonto a tiempo atr s aquellas famosas expulsiones en una final a este equipo jugando de local le echaron tres jugadores y eso no lo vi en mi vida y al monterrey le echaron tres jugadores en una final
2648694 creo que perd un poco la cabeza y entr al campo de juego para decirle que hab a dos equipos profesionales que trabajamos eh porque nosotros trabajamos y si tiene que respetar al que trabaja y el rbitro para m no respeta porque hay tres jugadas la primera el l nea no ve una mano la ve el rbitro un foul del central y no amonesta donde la regla as lo dice y despu s una jugada donde amonesta a fabi n despu s finge una falta y es expulsi n y te puedo contar diez o quince jugadas el penalti dudoso lo atajamos y lo hace patear de vuelta y bueh las chivas sacaron el empate
2648695 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment
2648696 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2648697 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2648698 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2648699 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2648700 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty
2648701 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2648702 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2648703 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2648707 it is my opinion that the express language of 18 2 308 k limits the use of concealed carry permit information to law enforcement personnel for investigative purposes
2648708 prior to the 2008 legislative session gun rights activists and press associations agreed to a compromise which became senate bill 529
2648709 its hard to get a consensus between the access and the privacy pieces its always the balance that i think we have some difficulty trying to achieve
2648710 you want to put up where the rapists in a community are fine but the decent law abiding people you dont need to put that
2648711 it closes a backdoor but it leaves a front door wide open
2648712 but everyone is a criminal who just hasnt yet committed any crimes hmmm
2648713 its not that i dont like having sex with tyler
2648714 according to multiple sources edwards was apoplectic that abc news broke the story on its website and began promoting it early on friday
2648715 had hoped to control the news cycle by making his admission late on a friday night when the country was watching the olympics and the long weekend yawned ahead

2648717 the challenge was to build the worlds lowest van in just three days
2648718 we did it in front of an audience at the bug jam vw festival in northamptonshire
2648719 we were up at 6am and worked for three full days it was the hardest thing ive ever done
2648720 the biggest problem was the roof because when we cut a big chunk out there was a 14ins difference because of the tapering
2648721 then we had to move the steering into a central position and put in a new steering system
2648722 we lowered the seat moved the handbrake and the gear stick and replaced the fuel tank
2648723 it is roadworthy does about 80mph and you could throw mattress in the back and sleep in it
2648724 weve applied to the guinness book of records and theyve indicated this is the worlds lowest van
2648725 you know ive just laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2648726 sei que dif cil assumir numa situa o como essa mas vou dar o melhor de mim para conquistar o maior n mero de pontos poss veis estou preparado para dirigir o time contra o n utico espero ter uma melhor sorte

2648730 yeah the mets farm system is decimated they have nothing
2648731 todas as equipes pensam em chegar em primeiro mas a gente tem que manter esta regularidade
2648732 acho que tem sido a grande diferen a do meio do primeiro turno em diante os jogadores n o est o fazendo tanta falta quanto esper vamos
2648733 todos os jogadores que est o no cruzeiro hoje pensam num objetivo s quem est do lado de fora incentiva o pessoal do lado de dentro se for deste jeito at o final pode ter certeza de que o cruzeiro vai dar uma alegria torcida ainda
2648734 a portuguesa vem fazendo muito pouco para quem quer fazer uma boa campanha na s rie a n s n o estamos conseguindo nos acertar e temos muitas defici ncias mas ao menos sabemos quais s o temos agora que nos esfor ar no segundo turno e reagir
2648735 o time deles cresceu bastante e est numa posi o muito boa na tabela vamos ter muitas dificuldades eles estar o empolgados
2648736 o palmeiras tem crescido em um momento muito bom da competi o mas domingo vamos encarar um advers rio que tamb m tem chances de brigar pelo t tulo o botafogo sempre muito dif cil de ser batido no rio de janeiro
2648737 temos que ter o mesmo esp rito se corrermos e lutarmos como fizemos contra o vit ria vamos conseguir ganhar
2648738 claro que o jogo mais importante sempre o pr ximo principalmente porque estamos embalados e vamos jogar em casa diante de nossa torcida e contra um concorrente direto ao nosso objetivo esse campeonato brasileiro mostrou que n o tem dono e queremos muito estar na parte de cima nas rodadas finais mas temos que construir isso agora como estamos fazendo

2648744 these black ethics must be taught and exemplified in homes churches nurseries and schools wherever blacks are gathered
2648745 a location with good facilities adequate transportation and a reputation for producing skilled workers will attract industry we are in competition with other cities states and nations for jobs high productivity must be a goal of the black workforce

2648748 piye was the first of the so called black pharaohs a series of nubian kings who ruled over all of egypt for three quarters of a century as that countrys 25th dynasty
2648749 nubians are clearly noted as the ones who ruled egypt during the pramid years
2648750 i noted that they ruled during the pyramid building years
2648751 like which famous pyramids i havent seen any evidence of intensified pyramid building during those 75 years out of the thousands of years of egypts history
2648752 i have clearly stated that i am against minors or tax breaks for such videos
2648753 five years after the bush administration began a crackdown on voter fraud the justice department has turned up virtually no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections according to court records and interviews
2648754 there is widespread but not unanimous agreement that there is little polling place fraud or at least much less than is claimed including voter impersonation dead voters noncitizen voting and felon voters
2648755 but people who dont have bicycling knowledge and technique or the proper equipment they are much more at risk
2648756 i would rather ride my bicycle than get on the expressway or loop 410
2648757 amid dazzling fireworks lets not lose sight of the truth
2648758 i told him im glad you didnt give them all presents or youd be in the poor house
2648759 some of them actually come in on the first day of school
2648760 they need those shots especially for the new students the little ones in elementary school
2648761 were trying to encourage those who can to go ahead and get them this year
2648762 we really are encouraging people to go to whatever clinic is most convenient and closest to them
2648763 any knowledgeable educator would say that it is much harder today to get even an acceptable rating than it was five or 10 years ago because the state tests are tougher the dropout definition more rigorous and the basic ratings criteria higher
2648764 we need to be honest we need to have consequences the consequences are few and far between
2648765 when you look at the overall performance of these schools they are performing in the exemplary range
2648766 a lowered rating would really give parents a false impression of the schools performance
2648767 when we think about how businesses rate themselves when theyve met 95 percent of their goals at an exemplary level and if one goal is at 88 percent wouldnt we judge that business as having an exemplary performance
2648768 if they caught those people then that obviously gives me peace of mind
2648769 it was very frustrating because thieves targeted more of our stores
2648770 just in the past few weeks 30 tvs have been stolen from various businesses
2648771 computer magazine tells of pcs genesis right here in s a
2648772 decisions were made and we were also looking to provide a setting for our children closer to home
2648773 because the program is so small for the first year the cost is more expensive
2648774 as our population grows the per pupil amount sent to the programs becomes less
2648775 we have not really been able to raise that amount
2648776 it might sound like a lot for children but its not in my own program what i get in federal and state funding only covers budget and salaries right now everything else is on top of that
2648777 as a general rule school districts have deaf children and they provide a teacher to work with them
2648778 in a regional program you bring many children together there are other kids their age and they dont feel alone
2648779 a lot of those critters that you dont like having around your house these guys will take care of them
2648780 even rattlesnakes we believe are beneficial and deserve a second chance
2648781 its a process that will take many trips its about having an attitude of service and gratefulness its about seeing how good we have it
2648782 we just felt the lord directing us to do that
2648783 one day my husband who was an ordained minister and worked at bell helicopter came home and said betty we are going to help orphans in mexico i said ok
2648784 a pastor from piedras negras drove out to our place with two boys tony 6 and manuel 8
2648785 he asked are you guys open and i said we are now the timing seemed like a sign
2648786 for those of you who understand spanish i am glad to meet you all and thank you for coming groups like yours have given us much of what we have for those of you who do not speak spanish you should learn because they speak spanish in heaven
2648787 we arent going to kick them out when they turn 18
2648788 when her fiance asked for her hand in marriage he asked me
2648789 i think we are so lucky to have the things we do so many people dont have even things like what im holding right here
2648790 ive been praying that this wont just be another little fun trip ive been praying that this will be a life changing trip
2648791 it makes you tired but the feeling afterwards is great knowing youre helping somebody
2648792 you come over here and see that people dont have all the same stuff
2648793 chano looks like a hood ornament on that steer weve got about 20 cowboys out there trying to sort it out i sure hope hes ok
2648794 thats what normally happens to him if theres a wreck hell be in it
2648795 a two day race meet and rodeo with a dance each night was held in august area ranchmen donated goats and cattle for a free barbecue that was attended by over 4 000 people
2648796 our deal is a community celebration and reunion all the class reunions are held on the second saturday in august
2648797 you dont have a first memory of it its just something you grow up on my children were running around out there in diapers just like i was and like my parents were before me
2648798 its one of the few things where you can keep in touch with tradition because most of the old ranch families here have in some form or fashion dissipated
2648799 for over 50 years we ran horses both thoroughbreds and quarter horses
2648800 in the old days there was a lot of pot betting the old ladies would come out and wed tear up the numbers of all the horses in the race and then youd draw them out of the pot there might be 8 or 10 dollars in there
2648801 theyd go through the stand with a handful of money saying ill give two to one on the four horse or the one horse against the field
2648802 thats where the real money changed hands and sometimes things would get pretty western
2648803 its the end of an era people just dont need billies if they dont have goats
2648804 during my time wed sell about 125 billies and about 50 75 does at the sale last year they offered 75 for sale but sold only 40 this year they were not going to have over 15 goats for sale
2648805 its more wild its more open its more authentic and the contestants are actually working cowboys from around south texas the san antonio competition exceeded our expectations dramatically
2648806 big businessmen play golf we dont play golf this is the way we blow off steam
2648807 theres money to win but bragging rights are what everyone wants
2648808 growing ranch rodeo circuit is now a part of junctions fair
2648809 this was a statement about what we would like to have happen but not what we thought we would achieve
2648810 you cant turn around something like growth patterns absent some dramatic event
2648811 its like trying to turn an aircraft carrier its a long wide turn
2648812 the people on the edge of town are going to be the first ones to get really stuck with the transportation costs
2648813 we can kind of ooze in 360 degrees because of the geography
2648814 that is contrary to what every planner and master plan wants to do with the city of san antonio which is to strengthen the inner city
2648815 people who live near and in downtown are more involved citizens they are more engaged often theyre critics but thats ok too
2648816 people didnt seem to mind too much going farther and farther out
2648817 the idea was that you keep on driving until you can afford the house
2648818 three things drive the housing market in san antonio perception of security perception of school quality and proximity to work
2648819 intuitively i thought that gas prices would impact the subdivisions in our outlying areas but up through six months ago it hadnt
2648820 you can keep the wealth in your own neighborhood and continue to perpetuate substandard schools elsewhere
2648821 but what sells houses at the end of the day in texas is schools because we dont have viable schools in the inner city people are moving to the suburbs thats what drives the northside and north east housing market thats why alamo heights is in such demand
2648822 the notion that you have a house with a two car garage possibly three and you buy on a periphery in a good school district is very strong thats how weve built our homes since world war ii
2648823 people think sprawl isnt bad because we have the resource
2648824 and culturally a lot of success has been defined as moving farther out whether its to a rural environment or to a new house
2648825 the traffic has at least tripled since we moved out here
2648826 it might be a tough couple of years getting to work
2648827 its like obscenity you cant define it but you know when you see it
2648828 as a developer why would i want to change the formula to something ive not done before in a market thats not proven
2648829 the master plan city south and the udc update have tried to encourage more sustainable development the best the city can do is provide incentives for things that do achieve those goals
2648830 even the city south developers are not from san antonio
2648831 it underscores how we have a lot of work to do locally
2648832 people always say how do you get affordable housing in there you cant
2648833 the growth is going to occur where its going to occur
2648834 we try to incentivize those areas where it needs help
2648835 the periphery keeps moving and expanding you jump county lines
2648836 you dont get the benefit of outdoor living that you think you would get by moving out it is not a country experience
2648837 the people who were once in the country now find themselves looking at a convenience store or warehouse or 50 other homes the sprawl overtakes them
2648838 you couldnt get something like that past the legislature in our lifetime
2648839 we want people who come here to have the proper services and to have the ability to turn the faucet on and have water come out
2648840 we go up there to testify before the committees and all the counties from all over the state will say its a good idea
2648841 here comes the texas realtors association and the texas builders saying its a terrible idea and then here come the professional engineers
2648842 you have people coming into our cities in texas from the northeast florida or california and theyre very used to sprawl and having to commute long distances and having to pay high prices for housing
2648843 theres no way i could go from living out here to living there id feel claustrophobic
2648844 281 is a concern and the gas prices are a concern a lot of people dont want to move out this far because of that and actually some people are moving back in
2648845 when i go home to visit family i try to be in town by 2 p m but im still stuck in rush hour traffic
2648846 the gas prices will severely limit the ability for people to go to bandera and commute in everyone buying homes that cost 150 000 to 300 000 is affected by this they dont want to take their kids all over creation for school and sports
2648847 its the pure bedroom communities where you have to commute that will start to hurt
2648848 if you live away from town youre continually driving back and forth
2648849 changes in real estate and development patterns are a very long term process
2648850 we need to look at the financial and time resources spent on sprawl and create something better its what the master plan idealized
2648851 there may be ways of getting at some of these issues and guiding people toward a different life but that presumes thats the life they want i have all sorts of ideas about how other people should live that doesnt mean its the life they want
2648852 common market economists agree that the chief reason for the auto boom is the buoyant psychological climate which the vision of a single market of 170 million customers has created in western europe

2648855 cada d a surgen en el mundo nuevos medios o espacios de comunicaci n relacionados con la cultura ya sea en formato papel blog programa radiof nico o incluso televisi n por internet los periodistas culturales especialmente los que colaboran con medios diversos al tiempo han de abrirse a estos formatos emergentes abordando el producto cultural de forma novedosa por ejemplo la aparici n de las llamadas revistas de tendencias y estilos de vida que responde a la estrecha relaci n que hoy en d a se establece entre cultura y consumo es un fen meno significativo que el periodista cultural no ha de pasar por alto viajes objetos curiosos y maneras de plantear el ocio son hoy temas tan culturales como la publicaci n de una novela o el estreno de una sinfon a
2648856 si quiere seguir en su profesi n el periodista ha de tomar algo de la mentalidad y actitudes de los curadores de arte de los creativos de publicidad y marketing de los productores de cine y tv y de los gestores culturales y de turismo ese mix es el nico que en mi opini n lograr que sobrevivan
2648857 en el que queden dos o tres publicaciones culturales de l nea dura que probablemente acepten haber perdido la batalla de acercarse al gran p blico y por lo tanto no se sientan presionados en invertir excesivamente en temas de dise o y adem s todo un mercado de revistas para lectores cada vez m s espec ficos que les hablen de su cultura cultura gay cultura urbana de hecho m s de un suplemento cultural ya lleva el nombre de culturas as en plural creo que esto tiene que ver tanto con la correcci n pol tica no se desea que haya una sola cultura imperante como con esta segmentaci n extrema de los mercados

2648878 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2648879 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2648880 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2648881 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2648882 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2648883 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2648884 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2648885 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2648886 the arguments in favour of appreciation pre date recent concerns over inflation simply put china cannot rebalance its economy with a severely undervalued currency we expect rapid appreciation to continue

2648892 mr bachman and his wife barbara were visiting the drum tower in beijing china when they were attacked shortly after noon by an assailant wielding a knife
2648893 their daughter elisabeth was with them at the time of the attack
2648894 mr bachman died as a result of injuries sustained in the attack mrs bachman suffered serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital for emergency treatment her injuries are serious and life threatening
2648895 most of the players called their parents i told them to be strong
2648896 the president has been informed and his heart goes out to the families of the victims
2648897 the white house and us embassy have offered whatever assistance the family needs us officials have also been in touch with chinese authorities on the matter
2648898 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2648899 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2648900 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2648901 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2648902 the companys significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern
2648903 i telephoned him president sidi ould cheikh abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2648904 i explained to him how it could have serious consequences how it could lead to military engagements death and destruction and that it would be best to reconsider his decision but he was stubborn
2648905 it was our duty to remind him of his humanitarian responsibilities to try to dissuade him but he chose to ignore us just as in the same manner he tried to destroy the country and block its institutions
2648906 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2648907 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2648908 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2648909 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2648910 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2648911 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2648912 there were no planes there their task was to damage the runway
2648913 according to some reports several russian ships are patrolling near the port of poti and are blocking ships from entering the port with grain and fuel supplies necessary for georgia
2648914 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2648915 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2648916 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2648917 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2648918 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2648919 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2648920 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2648921 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2648922 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2648923 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2648924 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2648925 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2648926 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2648927 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market
2648928 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2648929 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2648930 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2648931 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2648932 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2648933 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2648934 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2648935 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2648936 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2648937 he was senior even to the defence minister he knew everything
2648938 crossing a red line supplying arms to hezbollah in lebanon
2648939 on the plan ride over i was kind of thumbing through it looking through it just trying to remember it
2648940 one thing we have to get straight is this chad thing
2648941 were going to have to call him rook or call me c p or something
2648942 i dont know he looks a little thin he needs to eat some chicken wings or something
2648943 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom
2648944 this has got to be the year they go to the super bowl right
2648945 i think theyre going to the superbowl this is their best chance ever
2648946 every team has injuries but the chargers have depth they played well against the titans and colts when these injuries were fresh now they are much better
2648947 we learned from the championship game that we can play with anybody whether theyre undefeated or not
2648948 what we have to understand against those guys is that they capitalize on every mistake you make there are some things you can rebound from in games where maybe youre a little bit of a better team than your opponent but you cant do it against them
2648949 you kick four field goals youre going to lose its those little things where you think oh we got points so were ok were going to get a lot more opportunities well you might not against them
2648950 but i think it would do great things for our confidence if we beat them
2648951 i have no concerns about hardwicks health and i have no concerns about him helping us to win
2648952 its an overused clich all ive ever said is that i want us to be a playoff caliber team each and every year so that we can have a chance to chase a world championship each and every year and hopefully one of those special years will happen for us
2648953 would i be surprised if we didnt reach the super bowl
2648954 no but id say we would be disappointed we were disappointed last year
2648955 now its like whats left over the last four years we got into the playoffs and we left early we went 14 2 and we didnt make it weve done everything from top to bottom
2648956 with the economy being what it is the fact that were hiring when a lot of places arent putting food on the table you can put politics aside
2648957 were just extremely pleased with the fact that theyre out there and the fact that theyre growing so much
2648958 hes been in my heart ever since i saw him
2648959 obama was the biggest name out there and we did put on the full court press
2648960 obama supporters across america are proudly displaying tigereyes great work everyday
2648961 buttons is the business we sell them for a buck and everyone gives them out
2648962 thats how my dad started out a camera and a button machine on the front porch
2648963 we used to have one ups pick up per day
2648964 then we had two and now they leave us a trailer to fill up and they still come twice a day
2648965 it just got to the point where we didnt feel comfortable working both sides anymore
2648966 we do not stand behind larry craig and never have
2648967 donors need to be thinking about who they would call on in the event of an emergency thats who they need to name when theyre donating
2648968 we want to make sure that the blood banks are supplied we work so well with the american red cross they need it as badly as we need it
2648969 theyre particularly special because very often its our first responders who are the ones needing blood and blood products at the scene of an accident
2648970 theyre also the ones that can see and fully understand that if the product wasnt available they might be the ones to see someone maybe not pull through
2648971 i think we can bring it home again and with a wider margin
2648972 tell every police fire and rescue station that lowry says this
2648973 the guys were supposed to give me a date to take the asbestos out i dont have that yet
2648974 then we need a permit to tear it down it would probably happen that week within days
2648975 were waiting to see what if any sanctions the court will impose
2648976 they cochran will have to put on evidence as to what theyve done to comply with the courts order
2648977 on aug 13 the court could try and pierce the corporate veil and find the corporations officers liable for not tearing the building down
2648978 it is my opinion that the building should be demolished or repaired as soon as possible
2648979 the building to be so old dilapidated so in need of repair as to be dangerous unsafe and otherwise unfit for human habitation or occupancy and that it presents a danger to the surrounding community
2648980 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2648981 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2648982 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2648983 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2648984 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2648985 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2648986 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2648987 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2648988 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2648989 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2648990 we had a deal i told bob that i wanted this to be my last 400 im he said i have to end on a record
2648991 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2648992 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2648993 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2648994 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2648995 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2648996 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2648997 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2648998 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2648999 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2649000 ive been to the olympics once that made my decision easier
2649001 i feel the us open is my best chance to win a grand slam beijing and starting a major five days later its working out well for me
2649002 mardys a good player but i didnt let him do anything today
2649003 im so happy to be in my first hardcourt final id love to win another title i actually prefer hardcourt more than clay my coach has taught me that he has changed my mind my game everything
2649004 from postwar to where we are things are better and in most cases from prewar to where we currently are now is better for people to say we havent done very much i think thats because we just havent somehow gotten the attention
2649005 im an operations research analyst in the strategic effects economics division of multinational forces i actually work for an australian air force group captain the equivalent of a full colonel all of us work for a two star u s army general were trying to help the iraqis grow their economy so they can develop their country and enjoy the benefits they have been denied so long
2649006 i saw afghans being treated side by side with americans at bagram air field hospital a 9 year old boy named sadiq uhllah had stepped on one of the 10 million land mines left behind by the departing soviets as their legacy to the afghan people broken and burned over 65 percent of his body he had zero chance of survival his parents brought him to the americans who saved his life and performed more than 30 operations over the next six months to allow him to return home to his family
2649007 my primary mission is force protection of the base i brief the commanders on the threats theres not too much i can go into im an all source intelligence analyst i pull from newspapers other open sources and from classified sources im almost like a classified news reporter i brief higher ups im in the southern region of iraq its a relatively calm area as an intelligence analyst im never going to leave the base they dont let people with a top secret clearance go too far
2649008 al gore who aspires to be mr reddy kilowatt himself and david cameron the grassy green leader of britains conservatives are calling in reinforcements but only each other
2649009 its a good rule of thumb in american scandals that no matter how big an idiot someone is the outrage over him will always be more idiotic
2649010 dems will fight tooth and nail over the small things as well as the big things if bush wanted to appoint a conservative as toothpick inspector general the dems target him or her are you happy pc inspector for immediate destruction republicans on the other hand will yawn when the dems offer up a wacko aclu extremist for the supreme court the dems strategy seems to have worked well since well look at bolton the republicans dont have a whole lot to show for being in control of virtually everything does something need to change
2649011 by tom delay whether you like delay or not he has a point dems file frivolous lawsuits in an effort to crush their opponents while republicans can barely be bothered to give a slap on the wrist to a guy who steals documents i would submit that republicans should be going after lawbreakers instead of letting them slide but should resist whatever infinitesimal impulse there is to copy dems by filing frivolous lawsuits against them 5 things republicans can learn from the democrats
2649012 at what point does it dawn on you guys that its time to go after the democrats as hard as theyre going after you
2649013 yeah thats right i killed your dog and there isnt a damn thing you can do about it we have the authority and power to do this and if you dont stfu and do exactly as i say then youre next
2649014 we cut the scrimmage a little short today just because we had some guys suffer some bumps and bruises earlier this week we didnt want to jeopardize anyone today
2649015 but im pretty happy with where we are right now for the most part our players reported in good shape weve only been in full pads for about two days so we just ran a lot of our basic plays on offense and basic formations on defense our players have done a good job of picking up on things to this point
2649016 why would anyone want to take off on a boat and sail half way around the world

2649025 students need to be told about basic sexual acts like sexual intercourse and masturbation
2649026 it has been seen that children get exposed to sex and sexuality through internet and other sources from the age of 12 13 onwards the exposure is more in public schools but the government school children too are equally exposed to this so it is necessary that they are provided with basic and right information on this
2649027 all translations till this have been on very serious writing there was no fun writing we are hoping to come out with a sequel and translating classics as well
2649028 actually there are excellent books in tamil much more than in english and tamil writers are much better than english writers only because of the language barrier they are not popular

2649032 the king abdullah is saying christians and muslims need to get along better then look at whats happening at home this just shows and exposes the heart of saudi beliefs they can spend money and spin things and they can do pr but what matters is what happens at home

2649042 katy perry should quit writing music and be a waitress
2649043 but this is what i realised islam is a religion this religion can cater for more than one political ideology god did not reveal one political or economic system he only laid out guidelines so much of it is open to interpretation
2649044 i studied in prison as an islamist i believed that sovereignty is for god alone but then i realised that sovereignty is a modern concept and that anyone who says sovereignty is for god is saying he is god because he is saying that he has sole right to say what god thinks
2649045 oh no single piece of our mental world is to be hermetically sealed off from the rest and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which christ who is sovereign over all does not cry mine
2649046 we have mobilised all forces including the military and police to overcome the effects of the floods
2649047 we are trying to get to the flood victims bury the dead and provide medical treatment to the injured
2649048 telecommunications cables have been cut in some areas it takes half a day to walk from the local commune headquarters to the places were victims are stranded

2649052 i think this could be a good direction for me
2649053 what you are watching is really a confrontation between russia and the west
2649054 indeed since when exactly has russia been known for its generosity humanitarian work and peacekeeping efforts as usual the commies are full of crap this is russia gobbling up surrounding countries and brining them under the control of moscow
2649055 now come one come all to this tragic affair wipe off that makeup whats in is despaaahhhhhhh

2649059 are you going to answer or continue on with your perversions
2649060 fine fine if we must know about my entire loveless life then i gues we must
2649061 sam found out i was cheating on him with trey although truthfully i met then both on the same night then just switch it up a little for a few weeks i couldnt decide between sams boy next door charm or treys sexy rocker look
2649062 oooohhh and they both were amazing fucks i just couldnt choose it was so hard
2649063 so i was on a date with trey and things had just started to get heavy very sexy and very steamy when as trey is about to get to business down south i see sam standing about 10 feet in front of us looking completely shocked
2649064 but thats beside the point so sam comes over and starts yelling at me can you imagine that yelling like i was doing something wrong
2649065 well in the end trey walked away because things got too intense and he has more options available than some little slut that isnt very good anyways sam left after that feeling that treys diss was enough blow to my ego for one day that is why i am currently on your bed about to cry because the boys on your ceiling are so fucking hot and i really want to get laid tonight

2649085 i feel sad seeing the situation in the country the present situation is quite contrary to what we had imagined for the country while walking on the path shown by mahatma gandhi today we can see corruption everywhere
2649086 our country is great people follow different religions and there are all kinds of people so there is bound be some difference of opinion but on the whole our country is on the path of progress i am satisfied
2649087 i have already created a record of playing the mridangam non stop for 101 hours i have the confidence of still bettering this record
2649088 nobody in the music field has ever attempted this type of record of paying mridangam non stop for 101 hours and above whats more interesting is that he ramakrishnan himself is now attempting to break his earlier record which in itself is a unique attempt
2649089 caterpillars have engulfed the crop our standing crop has been destroyed there is nothing remaining
2649090 crops in besawar jatoi nogaon and garhwali region have been destroyed the crops of sesame seed bamboo and pearl millet have been destroyed completely by caterpillars
2649091 though it took the authorities bit long to get electricity to khattapani it is not the fault of administration only we tried our best to get electricity here but it took us sometime
2649092 for nearly a hundred years we led a life of isolation from the rest of society getting power today after mutely watching a lit up mussoorie means nothing this cant be termed as something of an overnight development life has gone in the past and will also go on now

2649107 ill bet that phrase is a reference to josh billings
2649108 josh the best guess is that the americanism josh for to kid or fool around is a merging of joke and bosh the pseudonym of an american writer may have something to do with the word though henry wheeler shaw 1818 85 wrote his deliberately misspelled crackerbox philosophy under the pen name josh billings employing dialect ridiculous spellings deformed grammar monstrous logic puns malapropisms and anticlimax he became one of the most popular literary comedians of his time the expression to josh was used about 18 years before josh billings began writing in 1863 but his salty aphorisms probably strengthened its meaning and gave the term wider currency
2649109 outsiders should avoid pressuring china too much or it will return to radicalism
2649110 china will improve and enjoy more democratic rights but it needs time
2649111 the pen name of humorist born henry wheeler shaw 20 april 1818 14 october 1885 he was perhaps the second most famous humor writer and lecturer in the united states in the second half of the 19th century after mark twain although his reputation has not fared so well with later generations

2649122 we have seen steady and material deceleration in googs organic revenue growth
2649123 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
2649124 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
2649125 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
2649126 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
2649127 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
2649128 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
2649129 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
2649130 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
2649131 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
2649132 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season

2649172 sometimes you think things are going to be easy from the get go and theyre not
2649173 were playing against very good teams that have been together for a long time
2649174 he did a great job you just tip your cap to him he did what he was supposed to do and their offense did a lot of damage
2649175 that got them going their offense has been struggling lately and that play really opened things up for them
2649176 shelbys home run retherford and thon hitting the ball off the wall in the ninth those were all positives
2649177 i think our effort was still there and we didnt give up persichina did some heads up base running on a ground ball in the ninth and thon did the same thing no one was going to give up even with the score what it was
2649178 i just feel like a weight is off my shoulders just a huge relief
2649179 weve come close we havent been able to close the deal ive had to be patient
2649180 he was leading last week in the rain by nine seconds
2649181 i was pretty impressed with our pass rush early on with our firsts
2649182 all in all not a bad first start and i think we made it out healthy
2649183 i think its well documented i think pep was disappointed in his season a year ago
2649184 he worked very hard this offseason physically when you look at him he looks outstanding i think hes gotten stronger and i think we saw the results of that
2649185 i would like to have seen jake get a few more throws but it didnt work out that way
2649186 i didnt want to put him in harms way this early in the preseason weve got three games left to get that done
2649187 the event starts to hurt halfway through it so for him to do what he does after that last turn and go that fast its pretty much inhuman
2649188 yes i did but i was not going to give him that sense of satisfaction
2649189 i think it pretty much goes in line with michaels way of operating whatever comes up he can turn into motivation
2649190 its the hardest ive ever seen him get hit that never happens it really doesnt
2649191 my job is pitching my job is to go to the mound and throw six seven eight innings but today i didnt do my job
2649192 i lost the count how many four well good for them
2649193 there is nothing you can do about it just move on and think of my next start
2649194 i really had no idea its one of those things
2649195 for me as long as im having good at bats and going up there not making bad outs im ok obviously at 0 for 29 it didnt turn around for a while i was able to get a couple in there and take advantage of a couple balls he left up
2649196 its going to take a lot of hard work from everyone on the team
2649197 that win at sonoma wasnt easy at all once the green flag falls youve just got to stick to your strategy and hope everything works out in your favor
2649198 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got
2649199 whether we win or whether we run out of gas just doesnt matter at this point weve got to win
2649200 its important especially for the first two or three races of the chase when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at
2649201 it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2649202 weve got to get at least two weeks in a row to get good finishes to solidify our place its not like were getting caught up in wrecks its just dumb stuff that we get caught up in were inconsistent right now we run top 10 and then run in the 40s
2649203 right now i feel like theres five races left we can have no more than two bad races
2649204 if we finish 25th or worse were going to have to have some help
2649205 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family

2649207 you know there are a lot of things we cannot control the thing we can control is ourselves try to deal with it try to be strong
2649208 of course its a very very difficult time and its the first time in my life to deal with that situation before a game i have to be patient and let players get over it and cheer for them and help them
2649209 well see how he feels as the afternoon progresses im not saying that well be able to use him im not saying were not

2649246 i was thinking that might play into my favor on the first start i was like hey we might have something here we both spun our tires on the second start but i didnt as bad as he did and i was able to get in front
2649247 i cant be mad at tim for something i would have done but every start weve had on the front row together this year weve waited until we got to the line but this time he went early and he did it both times the second time looked like a closer start but thats because when he went early i had to go too
2649248 i just couldnt get a start but tims car does stuff that my car wont do i dont know what hes got or what hes doing but his car does stuff mine wont do that said i started on the pole so i should have won the race ill take the blame for that

2649287 there was all this excitement about them being born but then they didnt come home
2649288 but she loved scrubbing in and going to see them in the nicu
2649289 im looking forward to going back to school with 150 eighth graders
2649290 think about when they all want to do something different and they have their own agenda
2649291 one hundred years after col drake completed the nations first successful oil well in titusville pennsylvania the new orleans oil centennial committee deposited historical documents here to commemorate the occasion
2649292 era some estimate that global oil supplies will begin to decline in mid century and that by 2050 the decline in production rates from having used up this limited resource will be precipitous
2649293 on the average were about 10 percent down in rounds from january through june
2649294 our slight price increases have allowed us to be very close to last years numbers as far as revenues go were basically flat in revenue
2649295 its economically a very challenging time and looking back at the spring golf season now i think were satisfied we didnt lose a big market share
2649296 some of the golfers trips were shortened a bit but looking at the airfare concerns and the economy were satisfied with the spring and looking forward to the fall and next spring
2649297 if were only down 3 percent as a market then were ahead of the economy and ahead of other golf destinations
2649298 theyre not spending as much in the pro shop but theyre playing golf theyre going to sacrifice a few other things they may not go out to dinner as much or eat at a less expensive restaurant or not buy as many souvenirs but theyre going to play golf
2649299 its always a surprise to people who come to myrtle beach for the first time they dont know what myrtle beach is
2649300 we need to do a better job of informing the public of whats here and a better job of promoting it
2649301 if people cant get here in a timely and affordable manner we can have the best golf courses in the world and they wont play them
2649302 we cant shun golfers simply because we cant get them here
2649303 tale of a gallant ghoul that is fast filling the void left by
2649304 so then why the hell are you in here instead of out there
2649305 toch zijn er geen enkele wetenschappelijke gegevens die erop wijzen dat zich een grotere beving dan diegene die bekend zijn kan voordoen in de regio court saint etienne ottignies
2649306 going into the ready room i started getting these kind of like chills up my body
2649307 right then and there i knew i was starting to get more and more excited i was pretty emotional after that race
2649308 im pretty excited to have the first one under my belt
2649309 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2649310 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
2649311 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2649312 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2649313 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2649314 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics
2649315 if the election is close it could come down to small demographic changes in some areas
2649316 its going to hem in the fed its going to be harder for the fed to weaken what theyve proposed
2649317 it sends a message that you did the right thing
2649318 the fed is going to act and is going to establish a new baseline for consumer protection that everyone will follow
2649319 we hope they will consider the impact this will have on pricing in the marketplace and the big question of whether or not low risk consumers are going to have to subsidize people who pose a higher risk
2649320 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2649321 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2649322 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2649323 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2649324 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2649325 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it
2649326 youll have to get him to put it together when he gets home tonight
2649327 all i was trying to do was the right thing
2649328 the agent said we are going to be watching him we cant be watching you
2649329 they are humans no matter what they do all i was trying to do was the right thing i was just trying to do my job
2649330 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2649331 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2649332 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2649333 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2649334 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2649335 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2649336 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2649337 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him
2649338 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics

2649340 werbung in social networks l uft zurzeit noch nicht gut doch
2649341 f r uns war die teilnahme am wettbewerb eine art marktforschung

2649343 f r uns war die teilnahme am wettbewerb eine art marktforschung
2649344 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2649345 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2649346 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2649347 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2649348 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2649349 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2649350 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2649351 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era

2649355 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2649356 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2649357 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2649358 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2649359 with chroma acrylics spraying your actual painting from time to time is one way to keep the paint flowing and blendable they say it takes a bit of getting used to i found this to be true but its not rocket science either if the paint has tacked up enough it wont run unless you overspray a single squirt is about enough i found that the more thickly you apply the paint the longer it stays workable

2649361 firefights erupted and people abandoned their homes there are lots of evacuees now in those three areas there are lots of milf members
2649362 suzannes strong understanding of our brand coupled with her passion for design and her experience as a journalist interior designer and television host are a great combination
2649363 as a kid i turned shoeboxes into houses decorating the insides my mom had me meet with her interior designer and she took advice from me over her designer
2649364 i had an appointment to go to martha stewart her people head hunted me and i was this close to going but martha was going through some problems

2649369 ricciardi has been at his job longer than 21 other general managers and for exactly the same length of time as dave dombrowski of the tigers and mark shapiro of the indians of nine gms that have been in place as long or longer than j p six have taken their club to a world series berth while two others have been to the post season only ricciardis clubs have never earned a playoff spot
2649370 since opening day 2002 only baltimore cincinnati kansas city milwaukee pittsburgh seattle tampa bay texas montreal washington and the blue jays have failed to reach the playoffs of those 10 teams only the jays still have the same gm
2649371 a womans heart should be so hidden in god that the man that wants her has to search for god to get to her
2649372 the russian message was clear this is our sphere of influence others stay out
2649373 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2649374 bush administration officials acknowledged that the outside world and the united states in particular had little leverage over russian actions
2649375 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
2649376 america and europes actions on kosovo left russia feeling threatened encircled and more convinced that it had to take aggressive measures to restore its power dignity and influence in a region it considers its strategic back yard
2649377 you guys have got to see this this guys trying to fight a deer
2649378 yea this dude hey wait theres a couple more guys now yea its like 4 dudes fighting a goddamn deer
2649379 pens que alguna vez podr a juntar los n mero 10 en una foto porque ser a algo curioso y porque adem s sus experiencias ser an muy parecidas
2649380 dios padre celestial parece decir a toda la creaci n es bueno que t existas
2649381 como una gran acci n de gracias a dios padre en primer lugar y a nuestros propios padres en segundo t rmino porque si no se hubieran animado a tener una familia grande todos esos d cimos no hubieran estado all presentes
2649382 se aprende casi necesariamente a compartir a esperar a tolerar la frustraci n y postergar la gratificaci n actitudes tan necesarias hoy en d a y tan mencionadas por los psic logos a valorar cada vida humana como un precioso regalo de dios padre a aprender que con poco uno se puede conformar porque lo importante y necesario no es lo que el mundo te ofrece como imprescindible sino la presencia del que tienes al lado
2649383 hoy es cada vez mayor el miedo a no poder dar lo imprescindible desde lo material el mundo rechaza a las familias numerosas y a veces son muy atacadas como si fueran una gran locura pero los que se deciden a armar una familia grande necesariamente tienen puesta su mirada en lo alto creyendo que es m s valiosa la existencia de un nuevo miembro y el hecho de poder darle un hermano a los otros hijos que lo material que no pudieran llegar a tener
2649384 en el mundo hay mucho miedo al hijo por motivos diversos pero te idos quiz s de cierto ego smo pues en la cultura posmoderna en que vivimos el placer es priorizado sobre el valor de la vida y obviamente tener un hijo implica responsabilidades que necesariamente deben postergar nuestros propios intereses moment neos
2649385 no hay gratificaci n laborar ni personal que compense la alegr a de ser colaborador de la obra creadora de dios
2649386 encontrar el tiempo para atender a cada uno personalmente sin masificar diferenciar a cada uno sin generalizar no hay recetas y suponemos que cada familia sigue su propio estilo pero se debe priorizar el tiempo de la familia y para estar en familia
2649387 el secreto se alaron radica en vivir cada d a como si fuera el nico obviamente cada etapa de la vida tiene sus caracter sticas y a veces no se puede decir en algunos momentos soy feliz pero a la larga uno eval a que son mayores los beneficios en todo sentido que las carencias que se pueden haber sufrido
2649388 c mo hacen para educar bien en la fe a tantos hijos
2649389 reconociendo que como padres y personas individuales todav a hay mucho por mejorar y aprender se dice que uno educa con el ejemplo pero a veces somos tan mal ejemplo de todos modos debemos hacer hincapi en la oraci n en familia y en la participaci n de la eucarist a la madre teresa dec a que una familia que reza unida permanece unida hay que sacarle el tiempo a otras cosas pero no debe faltar la oraci n en familia
2649390 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2649391 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2649392 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2649393 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2649394 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2649395 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2649396 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2649397 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2649398 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2649399 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2649400 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2649401 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2649402 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2649403 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2649404 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2649405 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2649406 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2649407 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2649408 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2649409 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2649410 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2649411 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2649412 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2649413 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2649414 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2649415 there will be more celebrities in denver than there were when the democratic convention was in los angeles eight years ago america understands celebrity and these people will be there to see obama it will help generate the kind of excitement we want to see
2649416 there will be photocalls with some of the bigger names and there are plans being worked out for ben affleck and matt damon to do some sort of gig on the stage
2649417 obama cant avoid hollywood even if he wanted to they have raised so much money for him
2649418 he was getting blasted last week for behaving like a blonde bimbo and what does he do he sends out gwyneth paltrow to do a get out the vote video it was like saying my blonde bimbo is better than yours
2649419 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2649420 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2649421 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2649422 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2649423 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2649424 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2649425 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2649426 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2649427 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2649428 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2649429 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2649430 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2649431 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2649432 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2649433 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2649434 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2649435 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2649436 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2649437 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2649438 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2649439 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2649440 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2649441 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2649442 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2649443 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2649444 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2649445 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2649446 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2649447 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2649448 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2649449 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2649450 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2649451 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2649452 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2649453 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2649454 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2649455 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2649456 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2649457 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2649458 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2649459 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2649460 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2649461 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2649462 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2649463 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2649464 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2649465 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2649466 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2649467 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2649468 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2649469 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2649470 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2649471 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2649472 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2649473 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2649474 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2649475 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2649476 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2649477 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2649478 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2649479 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2649480 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2649481 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2649482 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2649483 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2649484 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2649485 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2649486 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2649487 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2649488 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2649489 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2649490 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2649491 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2649492 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2649493 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2649494 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2649495 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2649496 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2649497 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2649498 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2649499 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2649500 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2649501 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2649502 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2649503 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2649504 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2649505 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2649506 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2649507 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2649508 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2649509 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2649510 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2649511 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2649512 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2649513 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2649514 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2649515 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2649516 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2649517 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2649518 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2649519 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2649520 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2649521 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2649522 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2649523 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2649524 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2649525 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2649526 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2649527 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2649528 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2649529 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2649530 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2649531 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2649532 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2649533 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2649534 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2649535 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2649536 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2649537 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2649538 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2649539 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2649540 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2649541 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2649542 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2649543 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2649544 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2649545 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2649546 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2649547 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2649548 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2649549 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2649550 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2649551 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2649552 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2649553 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2649554 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2649555 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2649556 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2649557 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2649558 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2649559 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2649560 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2649561 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2649562 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2649563 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2649564 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2649565 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2649566 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2649567 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2649568 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2649569 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2649570 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2649571 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2649572 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2649573 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2649574 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2649575 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2649576 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2649577 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2649578 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2649579 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2649580 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2649581 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2649582 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2649583 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2649584 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2649585 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2649586 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2649587 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2649588 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2649589 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2649590 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2649591 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2649592 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2649593 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2649594 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2649595 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2649596 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2649597 just so you all know we did set a record
2649598 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2649599 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2649600 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2649601 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2649602 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2649603 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2649604 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2649605 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2649606 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2649607 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2649608 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2649609 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2649610 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2649611 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2649612 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2649613 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2649614 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2649615 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2649616 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2649617 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2649618 overall i think its been a good week of practice
2649619 were relatively healthy thats the best thing about it and i think we have great energy going in to week two
2649620 ibu ibu mari kita dengarkan wejangan dari ibu wakil bupati
2649621 ibu ibu jika bapak sugawe memimpin bakal terkucur kredit murah bagi para pedagang pasar beliau peduli wong cilik biaya sekolah juga gratis
2649622 beliau tokoh antikorupsi apa buktinya ibu ibu buktinya hari ini saya gak bakal bagi bagi amplop buat ibu ibu sekalian itu sama halnya

2649624 kelima calon aku coblos semua soalnya aku gak tahu siapa yang paling baik
2649625 pengadilan negeri jakarta selatan mengukuhkan dirinya menjadi kuburan bagi kebebasan pers
2649626 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2649627 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2649628 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2649629 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2649630 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2649631 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2649632 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2649633 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2649634 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2649635 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2649636 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2649637 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2649638 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2649639 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2649640 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2649641 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2649642 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2649643 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2649644 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2649645 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2649646 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2649647 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2649648 sometimes i have so much sex to try to calm myself down i get bored of it and men i sleep with dont seem to make as much effort because i climax so easily
2649649 within a few weeks i just began to get more and more aroused more and more of the time and i just kept having endless orgasms it started off in bed where sex sessions would last for hours and my boyfriend would be stunned at how many times i would orgasm then it would happen after sex id be thinking about what wed done in bed and id start feeling a bit flushed then id become aroused and climax in six months i was having 150 orgasms a day and it has been as many as 200
2649650 often ill want to wear myself out by having as many orgasms as i can so they stop and i can get some peace
2649651 the brain literally is squeezed into the spinal column what happens is you get compression squeezing strangulating of the brain stem which has all the vital functions that control sleep speech our cranial nerves our circulatory system even our breathing system
2649652 if the acid levels are severe enough they are going to do keyhole surgery and grab part of my stomach and wrap it around the valve to tighten it
2649653 people find it very odd when it happens and it isnt always easy to cope with strangers reactions
2649654 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2649655 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2649656 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2649657 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2649658 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2649659 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2649660 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2649661 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2649662 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2649663 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2649664 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2649665 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2649666 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2649667 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2649668 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2649669 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2649670 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2649671 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2649672 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2649673 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2649674 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2649675 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2649676 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2649677 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work

2649681 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2649682 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2649683 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2649684 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2649685 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2649686 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2649687 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2649688 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2649689 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2649690 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2649691 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2649692 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2649693 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2649694 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2649695 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2649696 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2649697 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2649698 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2649699 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2649700 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2649701 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2649702 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2649703 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2649704 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2649705 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2649706 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2649707 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2649708 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2649709 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2649710 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2649711 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2649712 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2649713 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2649714 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2649715 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2649716 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2649717 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2649718 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2649719 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2649720 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2649721 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2649722 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2649723 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2649724 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2649725 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2649726 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2649727 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2649728 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2649729 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2649730 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2649731 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2649732 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2649733 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2649734 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2649735 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported
2649736 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2649737 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2649738 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2649739 we felt that we did have it under control we felt we did everything that had to be done
2649740 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2649741 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2649742 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2649743 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2649744 ive always wanted to ask a lot of people in the town what do you think about them
2649745 it could happen we have to be aware of the implications there are bad implications and there are good implications
2649746 if it does happen well do our best to make sure that landowners are taken into consideration
2649747 the closer you are you should be compensated wed want to make sure that affected landowners are taken care of reasonably if there are wind towers near them
2649748 if we were approached by a company my feeling is the public votes
2649749 as a board were trying to be arms length with this
2649750 we established the fastball early and pounded the strike zone
2649751 then they got aggressive so we went to the breaking ball and got a lot of popups
2649752 its tough to come up with stuff to say every night
2649753 it didnt look good he carried us the last month and a half its a big hole to fill but were capable of filling it im just now starting to suck it up
2649754 i thought wed get some whacks at him the second time around
2649755 he kept us off balance youve got to tip your cap to him this is the second time hes thrown well against us
2649756 when you make them hit the ball and you dont walk anybody you can be very effective
2649757 one run isnt going to get you a win unless you get a shutout and we havent seen too many of those lately
2649758 hes a real scrappy guy you look at him hes a smaller guy but he goes out and plays with a big heart
2649759 it doesnt surprise you when he comes out there and starts to do that

2649855 the secretary general is alarmed by the escalation of hostilities in georgia which have resulted in large numbers of casualties and massive destruction in south ossetia and other regions of georgia
2649856 profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone including the bombing of the upper kodori valley
2649857 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2649858 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2649859 the georgians have made an offer of a cease fire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2649860 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces

2649865 some theme parks held up in the last recession but this is a different downturn so you cant necessarily say they will hold up during this one
2649866 we arent where we want to be but i think we are heading in the right direction
2649867 its just whether we have enough money so i need to make recognizable progress this year
2649868 stockholders would have been better off hiding their money under a mattress
2649869 our lack of pricing power was really a big surprise to me
2649870 that fits no one complains about that and we signed up ben amp jerrys to sell ice cream that fits disney does some of this but they are too subtle
2649871 we see it as an interest free loan and given this credit environment youve got to take advantage of that
2649872 there are too many yellow flags like weather or the broader economy to guarantee it
2649873 but if current trends continue then we can get there

2649916 just as 40 years ago when our generation was sent off to war with a lie today were watching our children kill and die in iraq based on similar falsehoods the vietnam war produced 60 000 dead and 300 000 disabled americans how many of this younger generation will have to die for the bush administrations lies

2649922 fewer than 5 000 poorly armed hizbullah terrorists stood off the mighty idf israeli defense forces for over a month an islamic terrorist gang with no tanks no artillery no fighter jets no attack helicopters and just a few rpgs and rifles held to a standstill nearly 30 000 crack idf troops with the finest tanks the best artillery the fastest and most advanced fighter jets and attack helicopters in the world and they can still empty our northern communities with their rockets whenever they want if that is not a victory then the word has no meaning
2649923 disfigured by its special relationship with the u s arms industry of which the u s congress is an integral component the idf has been morally corrupted by years of risk free brutalization of unarmed palestinians many of them children
2649924 its one thing to level an apartment building with a missile from a plane or crush a protester with a bulldozer or lob shells at a palestinian family having a picnic on a beach or kidnap middle aged and democratically elected palestinian politicians
2649925 its another to confront a foe with modest but effectively deployed weaponry prepared to fight back
2649926 years of racism have taken their toll too think of arabs as subhuman terrorists and you end up making a lot of misjudgments tactical and strategic
2649927 in lebanon more than 1 000 civilians some 30 percent of them children under 12 have been killed by israeli attacks and nearly a million have fled their homes sparking what relief agencies described as a humanitarian crisis
2649928 ive never seen so much destruction in such a very short time
2649929 nothing in three decades of war and recovery prepared him for the ferocity of israels month long bombing campaign
2649930 the damage is such that the last 15 years of work on reconstruction and rehabilitation following the previous problems that lebanon experienced are now annihilated
2649931 about 35 000 homes and businesses were destroyed in the conflict while a quarter of the countrys road bridges or overpasses were shattered according to the undps initial estimate u n agencies said it would take weeks to assess the full extent of the damage in south lebanon and southern beirut
2649932 these places now look like french villages did after german bombardment during the first world war i am sending my dispatch to
2649933 there are few marks on the road where the missiles hit the innocents of marjayoun
2649934 there are those who break down when they recall the massacre at joub jannine and there are the israelis who gave permission to the refugees to leave marjayoun who specified what roads they should use and who then attacked them with pilotless missile firing drone aircraf t
2649935 who flew the drones an israeli soldier of the invasion force a nameless officer in the israel defence ministry in tel aviv the israelis knew a civilian convoy was on the road yet they sent their pilotless machines to attack it why
2649936 greenpeace lebanon revealed on tuesday that exclusive underwater footage show ed large amounts of oil polluting the seabed off the coast of jiyye
2649937 the spill has already reached turkey and cyprus and according to environmentalists will have a huge impact on the biodiversity of the eastern mediterranean
2649938 for five weeks the israeli air force flew around 9000 missions many of lebanons largest factories were hit resulting in large fires
2649939 the fuel depots at beirut airport which were hit at the beginning of the conflict and the bombing of the power station ignited fires that burned for three weeks sending plumes of smoke that could be seen from 60 kilometres away
2649940 amnesty international accuses israel of war crimes saying it broke international law by deliberately destroying lebanons civilian infrastructure
2649941 the human rights group said initial evidence including the pattern and scope of the israeli attacks high number of civilian casualties widespread damage and statements by israeli officials indicate that such destruction was deliberate and part of a military strategy rather than collateral damage
2649942 the amnesty report cited the widespread destruction of apartments houses electricity and water services roads bridges factories and ports which taken with statements by israeli officials suggests a policy of punishing both the lebanese government and the civilian population in an effort to get them to turn against hizbullah
2649943 israel dropped cluster bombs on at least 170 villages and other places in south lebanon during its 34 day war with hizbullah guerrillas a senior united nations de mining official said yesterday
2649944 the devices are known to have killed eight people and wounded at least 25 including several children since a truce took hold on aug 14 said tekimiti gilbert operations chief of the un mine action coordination centre in lebanon
2649945 these cluster bombs were dropped in the middle of villages
2649946 some are small black and cylindrical easy to overlook and to detonate others are round and can look like dusty rocks
2649947 british mine clearance experts have accused israel of carpeting lebanese border villages with deadly cluster bombs claiming that more appeared to have been used than in the american led invasion of much larger iraq
2649948 there have been growing calls in recent years to outlaw the use of cluster bombs which scatter hundreds of small bomblets no bigger than an aa battery over a target area
2649949 among the victims was ali turkiye 13 who was harvesting grapes in the village of zawte when he accidentally dislodged a bomblet that had been caught in a vine
2649950 yusuf khalil died while helping the lebanese army to clear the munitions he was close to one of the bomblets and a frog jumped from next to the device and set it off leaving him with fatal head injuries said mr ali
2649951 the israelis dropped these in the last few hours of the war when the fighting was nearly over said hussein khatib a family friend
2649952 the united nations interim force in lebanon estimates that israel dropped approximately 150 000 bombs
2649953 mark garlasco is the senior military analyst for human rights watch
2649954 in nabatiya an 11 year old boy was killed after stepping on an unexploded bomb in front of his house
2649955 and we have counted over 30 villages so far where people are coming back to their homes to find unexploded ordinances in their living room in their patios on their rooftops and in their cars
2649956 during much of the 1980s the united states maintained a moratorium on selling cluster munitions to israel following disclosures that civilians in lebanon had been killed with the weapons during a previous 1982 israeli invasion
2649957 the m 26 is a particularly deadly weapon bonnie docherty a researcher with human rights watch who helped write a study of the united states use of the weapons in the 2003 iraq invasion
2649958 no strategic gain would justify in moral terms the death and destruction that israel has visited on its defenseless neighbor killing children is wrong period a war on terror cannot be won by a democratically elected government acting like a terrorist organization
2649959 my own personal opinion is that the iraqi people are not better off as a result of the invasion and people in america and great britain are not safer
2649960 you see watching tv every day i get so angry i just give up
2649961 make no mistake every arab now every muslim has a little bit of bin laden in himself were not religious fanatics but we just feel we have nowhere to go

2649981 the next step is to test filter technologies in a real world environment with a number of isps and internet users
2649982 it is very encouraging to see that the industry has made significant progress with isp filtering products and we are heartened that many of the products tested are commercially available with many of them already deployed overseas
2649983 filtering specifically against a black list of illegal content as well as the ability to filter additional material will be one part of the upcoming pilot trial

2649991 providing program information software code or command that would assist another in any material way to circumvent or otherwise attack the the security
