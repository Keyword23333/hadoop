2020108 i think before fly was born i was afraid to become a mother in part because i felt society didnt respect mothers but now i wonder if it was really myself who didnt respect mothering my perception now is that mothers are everywhere and they basically make the world go round
2020109 i just enjoy knowing that my husband and i are building a life for our son and that we are a family its great just spending time with my son its hard being a stay at home mom sometimes because your only label is mom unless you do something else i enjoy making music and volunteering my web and e mail marketing skills outside of being a mother
2020110 yes for both being a mom and a woman blogging about fly is a way to savor these days i have with him and as blogger oh amanda once put it blogging makes me feel i have accomplished more than just running errands or cleaning house that kind of thing
2020111 you know i have been to dooces blog only a couple of times one time she was really funny but another time it was just a regular post im not a reader i think its great she has such a following but i think that kind of fame would overwhelm me
2020112 i dont know if i can call this a pet peeve but something ive been curious about lately is the bloggers who used to comment and all of a sudden dropped off there are some really great women i miss hearing from it makes me wonder if i said something offensive if i got boring if they never really liked me in the first place or if they just got too big to comment on my little blog sheesh i sound so junior high i guess what im trying to say is i wonder what makes me lose readers commenters
2020113 we made tremendous progress in the business during the quarter beyond what is reflected in this quarters financial results in fact we enter the second half of the year with strong business momentum led by the closure of several service contracts and the expected closure of several others one of which could evolve into the largest non microsoft contract in the companys history although this quarters revenue fell below our expectations we currently expect that third quarter revenue will increase approximately 30 year over year and roughly 15 sequentially
2020114 software sales both proprietary and third party fell below our expectations this quarter
2020115 sdio royalties from key customers were weaker than expected due to lower device shipments which negatively affected proprietary software revenue we have won several new sdio design wins over the last few quarters and we expect royalties to increase as customer shipment volumes increase sales of our ti omap development kits also fell below expectations as the market is taking longer to ramp than we expected however there is strong interest in omap technology from customers and we are bullish that omap software and related service revenue will increase in coming quarters we will continue our efforts to build new proprietary software revenue streams through new product investments and new royalty bearing service contracts softness in third party software this quarter was driven by delays in orders from several large customers we expect that these customers will resume their normal ordering patterns in q3
2020116 while service revenue came in lower than anticipated this quarter due to softness in asia we enter q3 with a record backlog and our pipeline has never been stronger
2020117 several recent and expected wins in both north america and asia are expected to increase our service revenue for the rest of the year and into 2009 more than offsetting the minor softness we experienced in q2 im happy to say that the summer slowdown that has affected north america service revenue the last two years is not expected to reoccur this year
2020118 we had expected this quarters service margin to improve more than it did year over year while that did not occur due to the revenue recognition delays and other factors which affected this quarter we still expect our service margin to improve into the mid thirty percent range for fiscal 2008 as compared to 29 in fiscal 2007 depending on the effect of new potentially significant contracts over the next two quarters
2020119 the companys australian employment will be impacted by more than 20 or 350 positions primarily associated with assets expected to be sold

2020152 its good for a driver good for the team and good for the people back in the shop you could lose 50 straight races and win one and its like you forget about all that stuff
2020153 its a relief and it feels so good because of how hard it is to win these races for a driver and the whole team and company i think winning races and running up front is as much of a confidence builder that you can have in racing

2020161 as a nation we are eating more but doing less exercise and so the average weight is increasing but within the population some people seem to put on more weight than others
2020162 our findings suggest a possible answer to someone who might ask i eat the same and do as much exercise as my friend next door so why am i fatter there is clearly a component to obesity that is genetic
2020163 even though we have yet to fully understand the role played by the fto gene in obesity our findings are a source of great excitement
2020164 by identifying this genetic link it should be possible to improve our understanding of why some people are more obese with all the associated implications such as increased risk of diabetes and heart disease new scientific insights will hopefully pave the way for us to explore novel ways of treating this condition
2020165 this is an exciting piece of work that illustrates why it was so important to sequence the human genome
2020166 obesity is one of the most challenging problems for public health in the uk the discovery of a gene that influences the development of obesity in the general population provides a new tool for understanding how some people appear to gain weight more easily than others this discovery along with further results expected from the wellcome trust case control consortium later this year will open up a wealth of new avenues to understand and treat common diseases
2020167 we welcome this result which holds promise for tackling rising levels of obesity and the associated risk of developing type 2 diabetes
2020168 the discovery has been possible not only because of exemplary team work of scientists from a large number of institutions but also because of the cooperation of the 5 000 diabetes patients and 37 000 people without diabetes who gave blood samples for the study
2020169 major genetic study identifies clearest link yet to obesity risk

2020199 its wrong of the islamic council to wait for the
2020200 im 100 percent certain that the fatwa council will not come out in favour something which conflicts with european law
2020201 its very important to have the european fatwa council with us in difficult matters like this i am not in favour of the death penalty but there are islamic texts that various people understand differently this is why we need to know the attitude of the authority before we make a decision
2020202 to avoid turning the slowdown into a slump as soon as conditions allow the banks next rate move should be down
2020203 the longer inflation fears force the mpc to leave interest rates on hold at 5 the more severe the looming recession will be interest rates will eventually have to fall very far to lift the uk economy out of its current malaise
2020204 once interest rates start to fall i think that they will be cut rapidly perhaps all the way to 3 5 by next summer and perhaps even lower subsequently however this will come too late to prevent an outright recession later this year and a long period of very weak economic activity thereafter
2020205 pressure on householders income together with a very significant reduction in mortgage finance due to the global financial crisis is constraining potential house buyers ability to enter the market this is resulting in both lower prices and activity levels

2020225 now that you have had a chance to think the questions over give me your answers
2020226 well the first one which two days in the week begins with the letter
2020227 forrest that is not what i was thinking but you do have a point and i guess i did not specify so i will give you credit for that answer how about the next one
2020228 how many seconds in a year now that one is harder
2020229 twelve forrest how in heavens name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year
2020230 shucks theres got to be twelve january 2nd february 2nd march 2nd
2020231 i see where you are going with this and i see your point though that was not quite what i had in mind but i will have to give you credit for that one too let us go on with the third and final question can you tell me gods first name
2020232 ok i can understand how you came up with your answers to my first two questions but just how in the world did you come up with the name andy as the first name of god
2020233 andy walks with me andy talks with me andy tells me i am his own
2020234 well last time i was there claire told me she thought id lost weight
2020235 there is a pool of talent in seattle and a track record of therapeutic discovery here
2020236 i think the idea is that seattle has got some infrastructure it is a nucleus for research in this area
2020237 the hope is that we build very dynamic research in this area by combining forces with both groups
2020238 novo nordisk is in this for the long run a piece of what we will be doing in seattle will be target discovery programs as much as possible we are going to try to tailor those and differentiate them from the kind of approaches that other people are doing

2020242 i dont mind paying more but it is completely arbitrary it is not the money it is the price hike it is outrageous
2020243 when brian realised how much he was paying he disputed it we know the governor
2020244 he did say we have prices for regulars and prices for people who dont come here very often he dropped himself in it
2020245 it is not true at all that we fail to have tariffs on display and charge different prices
2020246 the price list is up on the bar now what has happened is some of the prices have changed
2020247 and it is not correct to say that regulars get drinks at better prices than tourists
2020248 i was fascinated by the psychic i wanted to know what it felt like when youre channelling or doing whatever it takes to get to that state of mind so he changed my perspective on it

2020312 on august 2nd falcon 1 executed a picture perfect first stage flight ultimately reaching an altitude of 217 km but encountered a problem just after stage separation that prevented the second stage from reaching orbit
2020313 at this point we are certain as to the origin of the problem four methods of analysis vehicle inertial measurement chamber pressure onboard video and a simple physics free body calculation all give the same answer
2020314 the problem arose due to the longer thrust decay transient of our new merlin 1c regeneratively cooled engine as compared to the prior flight that used our old merlin 1a ablatively cooled engine
2020315 unlike the ablative engine the regen engine had unburned fuel in the cooling channels and manifold that combined with a small amount of residual oxygen to produce a small thrust that was just enough to overcome the stage separation pusher impulse
2020316 did not expect it to last that long as it turned out a very small increase in the time between commanding main engine shutdown and stage separation would have been enough to save the mission
2020317 the question then is why didnt we catch this issue
2020318 unfortunately the engine chamber pressure is so low for this transient thrust only about 10 psi that it barely registered on our ground test stand in texas where ambient pressure is 14 5 psi however in vacuum that 10 psi chamber pressure produced enough thrust to cause the first stage to recontact the second stage
2020319 neither the near miss potential failures of flight two nor any new ones were present
2020320 we discovered this transient problem on falcon 1 rather than falcon 9
2020321 it looks like we may have flight four on the launch pad as soon as next month
2020322 the long gap between flight two and three was mainly due to the merlin 1c regen engine development but there are no technology upgrades between flight three and four

2020351 these are two of the best right hand hitters in the game
2020352 i liked what i saw last night and thats why hes in there
2020353 when the game sped up he stayed right there hes come a long way for me in the last month or three weeks
2020354 when i get the chance ill be happy with it and when i dont ill be happy anyway
2020355 this is a chance for me to also learn by watching a guy like manny play and watch his approach in the game and in the environment were in of a playoff run im not saying id rather sit id rather play but if this is it ill take a positive out of it
2020356 his approach as a hitter and it starts from in the dugout to when he gets on deck and in the box
2020357 i see the way he gets locked in before he even gets to the plate theres not a lot of jabbering from him when hes about to hit theres a certain preparation needed to get to that level and i might not have picked all of this up if i had been playing every game sometimes you get caught up in your preparation and outcome and results i could sit in the dugout and say why me ive decided to get something out of it and it can make me better in the long run
2020358 i told russell after the game you go up with the knowledge that the pitcher has to pitch to you but you still have to do a little work
2020359 you have to show the pitcher he still has to throw you strikes

2020361 he laid off tough pitches last night on that ninth inning walk hes got great baseball instincts
2020362 a big part of ramirezs protection in boston came from the guys ahead of him if he hits without runners on base theres no guarantee what his average will be or his patience guys at the top of the order its important for them to get on base to get him the pitch to hit

2020417 would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel
2020418 has been as great it is beautifully written and constructed with delightful prose it is the standard bearer the lesbian the grapes of wrath
2020419 love that smoulders in the shadows of the twilight world
2020420 these women are writing some of the best contemporary fiction
2020421 and the fact that they are not ghettoised speaks to a general loosening up of british society
2020422 what gives it a common identity is the extra political and emotional charge it has for its core audience who still struggle to see honest and fair representations of their lives in mainstream culture as long as this charge continues to exist the lesbian label will remain important
2020423 it is vitally important that the professional game plays its part towards ensuring the success of this initiative
2020424 this message was relayed recently to all football league club managers at their pre season meetings
2020425 rarely before has there been such determination and solidarity across the game on these important issues it is therefore vital that we take this opportunity to make a lasting difference
2020426 im delighted that the whole game is working together on this issue there is a general agreement that something has to be done to improve levels of respect for the games long term health
2020427 changing a culture is about long term commitment to change negative attitudes and abusive behaviour it needs the whole game working together to make a real difference and that is what collectively we have done
2020428 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2020429 twenty years ago when mining was still very much in force in the valleys we would have jumped at the chance but weve learnt to live without coal mining our air is clean our grass is greener weve learnt to live without it we dont want it we just feel at this time its mining coal at all costs regardless of the impact on our lives here
2020430 were already on our way to major climate change because of the emissions weve already got in the atmosphere so to be putting more out while just talking about maybe addressing the problem some time in the next 20 years is ridiculous we need to do something right now
2020431 when youre looking at who to vote for this year be it president or members of congress you really need to think about science when drafting public policy
2020432 well my child would be cured if we only had more stem cell research
2020433 i dont want to anger the religious right so ill just go along with this because i think my constituents think this anyway
2020434 what in gods name are these people doing why does the religious right try to limit scientific advances when they relate to human reproduction ive come to believe that the most extreme and frequently the most influential right wing advocates seek a country that comports with their view of the bible if it was up to them they would not only outlaw abortion altogether but all forms of birth control except the rhythm method and abstinence
2020435 i am going to elect politicians who care about science in public policy and who vote that way
2020436 congress passed a bill that allowed states to give health insurance coverage to fetuses but not the pregnant mother
2020437 the bush administration appointed not just one but two people to direct the office of family planning who are opposed to birth control they would be horrified
2020438 people can come and utilize the facility to learn more about the job and become part of the pool to become forensic analysts or scientists
2020439 by the end of the third quarter the preferred stock in fannie and freddie will be issued the treasury will have bought it
2020440 well be on our way toward a joint treasury agency combination
2020441 mortgages issued in the first half of 2007 are going bad at a pace that far outstrips the 2006 vintage suggesting that the blow to the financial system from u s housing woes will be deeper than many people earlier estimated
2020442 come on down to chop suey for a show you wont want to miss sydni deveraux and hottie mcnaughty present divine and depraved like good things like bad things we got you covered come angelic and leave salacious and satisfied
2020443 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
2020444 weve got to do everything we can think of including reducing the size of the task by real conservation
2020445 to push and pull improved technologies and greener alternative fuels into the market place in high volume
2020446 require auto manufacturers to make smaller more fuel efficient cars encourage consumers to chose those vehicles and discourage everyone from driving so much
2020447 100 things about your blogger you dont want to or care to know but youre going to know anyways
2020448 will definitely address all the environmental issues theodore oben unep chief of sports and the environment told ips in a telephone interview from beijing
2020449 i have been monitoring the press reports on chinese governments effort on making the beijing olympics games environmentally friendly
2020450 some efforts and investments are very positive but some other efforts are purely administrative and cosmetic measures such as closing many heavy polluters factories around beijing just for olympics
2020451 refugee youth have often suffered terribly and witnessed war first hand
2020452 some refugees are born in camps others grow up in camps which can mean a lifetime with little or no access to sport or recreation the gift of sportswear from olympic athletes around the globe inspires refugees and connects them to the world of sports beyond happiness it brings them hope
2020453 i am thrilled by this success and the strong support of the olympic family so far
2020454 of course we want to go much higher now the bigger impact we can make with this campaign the better i am convinced that with our common efforts we can collect many more items
2020455 i am confident that many of my colleagues will recognise the value of this project and be eager to contribute
2020456 it really is so easy to participate sport has given a lot to all of us and it is great to be able to give back a bit by bringing joy to refugees
2020457 its an expensive sport no doubt but the premiership is where everyone wants to be it costs money because all the teams are so good so do you have to spend yes and players are expensive are we prepared to spend absolutely when you get to the premiership the level gets raised and you have to do it justice and we will do it justice
2020458 how sad would that be if that was the height of our ambition
2020459 lets get promoted then not get relegated then let us be super competitive lets not say champions league football because that is not realistic for now we would be spitting in the wind things will take time and money and that will come
2020460 a lot of fans ask why we dont spend like mr abramovich
2020461 we dont need to buy big players to create headlines if we get promoted then will we have to buy household names we probably will need to we are spending money a dozen players in january and another half dozen already this summer but they are players who can play championship football
2020462 this a club with a great history weve not bought a championship club it just happens to be in the championship at the moment
2020463 but i feel like i own the club as does bernie and flavio when decisions are made its not like i have half their say i wish i owned more of course i do
2020464 it becomes an issue when we get promoted and we have 30 000 people wanting to watch us when that time comes well increase capacity
2020465 we wanted a coach who had got promoted at this level before
2020466 when we sit down together as shareholders we say that decisions have to be made as fans first we never got involved in football as a money making idea we dont want to be wasteful but we do want to be successful
2020467 but there is also pressure because i know there are expectations for us but i like that
2020468 in the end we bit the bullet and paid it
2020469 we didnt want to stop going just when there is so much excitement about our future
2020470 the ticket prices were a big shock to us especially as its the same old stadium
2020471 they have gone out and got big sponsors in which will help the club in the future they have done the ground up so making a much more commercial enterprise
2020472 it is not similar to kids in a sweet shop theyre doing it for a long term objective as well which is very important
2020473 qpr can now go forward and they can spend the money on the ground which looks much more ship shape now
2020474 i went to watch the italian under 21s put together a list went to see flavio and subsequently we got emmanuel jorge ledesma and samuel di carmine
2020475 briatore has used his contacts in italy and spain to get three very very talented players and thats a fantastic bonus
2020476 he has been down to the training ground three or four times and no more in the pre season so he leaves me to get on with the coaching side absolutely
2020477 he is not controlling or anything like that at all
2020478 its a pressure but you have got to embrace that pressure and it is far better to come to a club with expectations rather than without them
2020479 we are a little way away from achieving our aim of being in the premier league but we are going to try as hard as we can
2020480 youve got charlton wolves qpr and ipswich throwing money left right and centre
2020481 theres so much pressure so in a way although we are in there i dont see the pressure of that i think we can just be ourselves even probably bring one or two other youngsters into the squad
2020482 two planes from jakarta to pontianak airport were delayed this morning due to the thick haze

2020487 a lot of people are imagining that building as a parking lot
2020488 because the building has such an uncertain future theyll take whatever reasonable offer they have
2020489 we found the rare combination of highest precision and easiest to use in the tektronix instruments and software deployed at ndtv the patented diamond display feature on the wfm6120 waveform monitors simplifies complex monitoring issues in the video testing process and the acclaimed stay genlock feature in the spg600 help to ensure the highest quality of service for our customers
2020490 we have chosen tektronix video test and monitoring tools to attain assured quality in our video transmission and production we have file based workflow and need to keep video signals within legal pal color limits both immediately before acquisition and after final playout we are extensively using the diamond display in our production control chain to effectively keep video signals best suited to the dvb chain the end result is impressive
2020491 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant coal can provide usable energy at a cost of between 1 and 2 0 52 to 1 04 per million british thermal units mmbtu compared to 6 to 12 per mmbtu for oil and natural gas
2020492 i mean you cant count anybody out when that deal comes i certainly wouldnt count out any of the 12 i promise you that make it
2020493 weve been running right there we ran in the top five at pocono and that pit strategy you know didnt work out for us and we ended up 13th i think everybody at that top 12 category is running good enough certainly to be a factor

2020502 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
2020503 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
2020504 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
2020505 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
2020506 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
2020507 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
2020508 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
2020509 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
2020510 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
2020511 i cant assure you that this train wreck isn t going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2020512 i cant assure you that this train wreck isn t going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it

2020521 pages modal this is the tale of 3 friends who get stranded on an ilsand
2020522 i dont know if you know this john mccain is looking for someone for vice president who has more economic expertise than he does so congratulations to all of you youre on the short list
2020523 so who do you believe ron suskind who says that everything in the book is on the record many sources or the bush white house which is assailing suskind for
2020524 suskind who won a pulitzer while writing for the wall street journal has been watchdogging this white house ever since he worked with ex treasury department secretary paul oneill on the latters tell all book and the administration has never been able to wreck his reputation
2020525 a disdain for contemplation or deliberation an embrace of decisiveness a retreat from empiricism a sometimes bullying impatience with doubters and even friendly questioners
2020526 on the other end of the believability scale we of course have a white house long practiced in the art of deception
2020527 tony fratto a bush deputy press secretary uttered the standard denial about suskind yesterday
2020528 even if one is inclined to doubt the notion that the bush war team would actually fake a document in the service of better propaganda suskinds broader theme has long rung true that bush has spent much of the last seven years seeking only the kind of evidence that would square with his certitudes
2020529 when this came up on msnbc moderator chuck todd asked politicos mike allen whether this would lead the anti war crowd in congress to call for impeachment allen replied that it would give the lefty blogosphere something to grab onto
2020530 and so in less time than it takes to say dick cheney the subject is changed from what would be one of the most outrageous violations of the constitution in the history of the republic to a left right issue
2020531 if the white house asked the cia to cook up this disinformation aimed at the american people why shouldnt the righty blogosphere too be up in arms why doesnt every american regardless of political party have a stake in the truth and the rule of law
2020532 i know i know thats not chuck todds or mike allens jobs unfortunately the closest that the msm usually comes to weighing the evidence is saying ron suskind charges x and the white house denies it this is what is now called reporting
2020533 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq
2020534 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
2020535 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda
2020536 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
2020537 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq
2020538 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
2020539 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
2020540 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
2020541 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq
2020542 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million
2020543 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
2020544 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
2020545 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
2020546 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
2020547 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
2020548 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british
2020549 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd
2020550 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
2020551 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
2020552 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear
2020553 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
2020554 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
2020555 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
2020556 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
2020557 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there
2020558 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
2020559 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush
2020560 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
2020561 was sent to new york on a project for the book
2020562 detained by federal agents in manhattan he was interrogated and his notes were confiscated violations of his first and fourth amendment rights
2020563 all history was a palimpsest scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary in no case would it have been possible once the deed was done to prove that any falsification had taken place even the written instructions which winston received and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed always the reference was to slips errors misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy
2020564 what does this say for the average person on the street if we want them to co operate
2020565 how can we say to the ordinary citizen that you should report crimes tell the government what you know when the people who ran the department of justice thumb their noses at the system
2020566 schlozman was reshaping the civil rights division schlozman didnt know anything about voting law all he knew is he wanted to be sure that the republicans were going to win
2020567 unsubstantiated or false claims by the loser of a close race mischief and administrative or voter error
2020568 there is virtually no evidence that voter fraud ever occurs except by individuals and in rare instances
2020569 broke with established department policy by getting involved with contentious and partisan litigation on the eve of the election mr von spakovsky drafted legal briefs between the republican and democratic parties in three battleground states ohio michigan and florida just before the election all in favor of the republican partys position
2020570 these briefs ran counter to the well established practice of the civil rights division not to inject itself into litigation or election monitoring on the eve of an election where it would be viewed as expressing a political preference or could have an impact on a political dispute
2020571 they cooked up that there is a general exception to the policy because they wanted to prevent more fraud but indicting people before the election was not going to change anything registration had already closed there just wasnt a justification for bending the law
2020572 federal prosecutors and investigators should be extremely careful not to conduct overt investigations during the pre election period or while the elections are underway
2020573 a criminal investigation by armed badged federal agents runs the obvious risk of chilling legitimate voting and campaign activities
2020574 so keep fightin for freedom and justice beloveds but dont you forget to have fun doin it lord let your laughter ring forth be outrageous ridicule the fraidy cats rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce and when you get through kickin ass and celebratin the sheer joy of a good fight be sure to tell those who come after how much fun it was

2020632 folks are starting to figure out that traditional long only investing means that you have to be invested for a long time i have no problem with that philosophy provided your time horizon is 100 years and you dont mind 15 to 17 year periods where you dont make any money like the one were in now frankly i have yet to meet an investor with a 100 year time horizon and the patience to sit through a secular bear market in stocks and the volatility that goes with it
2020633 i believe the correct posture is one of caution not to be confused with being bearish i believe that every bet one makes must be measured and have considerable thought behind it its truly okay to miss opportunities but the big cyclical moves even within secular bear markets must be had the same is true for cyclical bear moves within secular bull markets which i believe could be a result of a combination of both time and price i do believe one thing for sure the sun will definitely come out tomorrow i just have to be around with my capital and my investors capital to take advantage of the sunshine
2020634 i believe time in the market with proper asset allocation is preferable to
2020635 unless you are a professional market timer which if you think about it is an oxymoron you should be using stocks for their most logical purpose long term investing and your investment portfolio should be allocated in such a way that allows you to respond similarly when someone comments on the market news of the day

2020646 having excess il 6 is bad but its local translation is required for muscle growth
2020647 treatments could be designed to compensate for or block the pathways leading to muscle loss

2020662 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2020663 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2020664 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
2020665 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
2020666 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2020667 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2020668 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2020669 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him
2020670 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2020671 i dont know how you hu mons can drink so slowly
2020672 hey do you mind if we put on some star trek episodes or are you watching this
2020673 the turbolift to the grand corridor was quite large but hey what do you expect

2020678 for the first time the idea began to take hold that john mccain can win this thing you saw the usa today gallup poll this week with mr mccain gaining six points since late june among those gallup dubbed likely voters mr mccain took the lead 49 to 45 among registered voters its still barack obama 47 to 44 a poll came out saying people are tired of hearing about mr obama mr mccain took the lead in youtube hits small stuff and there will be a lot of twists and turns before this is over but theres movement down there beneath the crust of the earth
2020679 incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee its time to turn the page on a politics driven by negativity and division so that we can come together to lift up our communities and our country
2020680 but if this is the low point for obama and mccain is still behind that isnt necessarily good news for the gop
2020681 in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
2020682 in fact he obama needs to rejuvenate and while thinking of these people ask himself again just why the hell he is running for presdient when he will have to represent all of those numbskulls out there and on this blog who have no clue
2020683 just as it happened in the primary race obama is losing steam
2020684 and with as close as it was this year that is why it was so disappointing for dem leaders to try to push her out before the primaries were even over when just years before they kept every door open for teddy
2020685 alpha lipoic acid completely prevented the increase in plasma total cholesterol atherosclerotic lesions and the general deterioration of health caused by diabetes

2020687 our results suggest that dietary alpha lipoic acid is a promising agent for reducing cardiovascular complications of diabetes
2020688 i know for a fact as vernons strategist that there was a meeting in sen harry reids office with david axelrod from obamas campaign and there was an agreement obamas campaign would help jim martin with the direct mail linking vernon and george bush
2020689 we were not involved in any way in that campaign neither the senator nor the campaign was involved
2020690 the benefits of whole grains are many and we hope this sends a positive message to kids heading back to school people flying in to denver for the

2020701 having dishonestly agreed with others to make or implement arrangements which directly or indirectly fixed the price for the supply in the united kingdom of passenger air transport services by british airways and virgin atlantic airways
2020702 at the time of these events iain burns was the head of pr at british airways with no responsibility for pricing decisions given his very high level of cooperation to the oft iain is naturally disappointed with their decision however he hopes that it will allow this case to be fully analysed before a court and finally provide him with the opportunity to clear his name
2020703 a top five healthcare communications practice with a 50 year history
2020704 played a principal role in fdas generally successful assertion of preemption in selected product liability cases
2020705 career is an illustration of how the bush administrations revolving door has allowed industry lawyers to radically reshape regulatory agencies to benefit the big businesses they once represented and then profit from those changes when they return to the private sector
2020706 rigorous and compelling research on the most critical issues affecting current drug policy
2020707 media is the lifeblood of ms amp l and our healthcare practice
2020708 our experts immerse themselves in the needs and changes occurring within the media
2020709 developing communications strategies to support or thwart issues including outreach to key agenda setters coalition building e fluencer campaigns and media outreach
2020710 ms amp l helps clients understand and influence government thinking on key health policy issues
2020711 monitoring emerging health issues to protect clients particularly legislative and regulatory activities
2020712 too many people are now not taking important medicines for pain depression and other illnesses because the nejm jama the lancet and the british medical journal have allowed their political love fest with the leftists in the media and their hatred of drug companies to pollute their ability to remain objective
2020713 a world renowned harvard child psychiatrist whose work has helped fuel an explosion in the use of powerful antipsychotic medicines in children
2020714 is that anyone who supports the use of psychiatric pharmaceuticals for any reason needs to be humiliated and destroyed
2020715 there is no credible scientific evidence linking antidepressants to suicide or violence
2020716 also unmentioned were the unrestricted grants that the infinite mind has received from drug makers including eli lilly the manufacturer of the antidepressant prozac
2020717 a former fda associate commissioner who was involved in the fdas 2004
2020718 what we didnt know because he didnt disclose it to us
2020719 was that pitts is currently working for a public relations firm whose clients include major pharmaceutical companies
2020720 i think its important to note that per full disclosure i was never asked i would like to assume that when i am called for interviews that the producers have done their due diligence
2020721 i also want to be clear that on the other programs mentioned
2020722 i was asked by the producers about my various affiliations i answered fully and honestly and the decision was made not to mention it on the air
2020723 peter pitts have you no shame does anyone have the dsmiv diagnosis for habitual lieing sic ed
2020724 here is the bmj retraction and apology as it pertains to lenzers unethical and sleazy behavior
2020725 during the treatment with the preparation prozac 16 suicide attempts were made 2 of these with success
2020726 a robust debate on the ssri issue is very important
2020727 trying to stifle debate by personal attacks just shows a lack of intellectual rigor and cowardice
2020728 where will healy david graham and the rest go to wash the blood off their hands and will the fda do the right thing and stop handing black boxes out to protect themselves from senator grassley and the press
2020729 mr pitts looking at all those posts on drugwonks com i couldnt tell who was making the personal attacks the kooks and the document stealers or the sites authors who label them that way
2020730 shannon brownlee and jeanne lenzer did a smear job on peter and dr fred goodwin in slate
2020731 we will do what ever it takes including legal action when facts are deliberately omitted misrepresented and distorted and then willfully repeated to set the records straight
2020732 we are aware that our critics dont have the intellectual bandwidth or the maturity to actually engage on the issues or respectfully disagree or debate
2020733 still we expect accuracy and for others to provide some context even as they take their shots as they are entitled to in a free society
2020734 woah mr pitts what a shame you sold your intellectual bandwidth and your integrity out to the pharmaceutical industry
2020735 our willingness to challenge those who have been responsible for scaring people from using antidepressants have diverted attention away from the consequences of a decrease in use with blind fury
2020736 moving from antidepressants to antipsychotics without regard to the original argument or point harping instead on funding sources with an obsession that reveals a lack of intellectual bandwidth and genuine hatred that borders on the personal
2020737 the blogs that have allowed these posting unfiltered know better and bear a responsibility for allowing the attacks and vitriol to become so unhinged and personal
2020738 the problem is they often reflect and influence the thinking of people like brownlee and lenzer who are considered mainstream
2020739 we at cmpi are simply trying to insure that people get the right medicine at the right time
2020740 wow gsk takes on the one person who has been the poster boy for all thats bad with pharma and the fda way to help your public relations
2020741 but there is also the holy grail of overturing fda pre emption
2020742 i want to see photos of almost nude people now
2020743 lift the stay in the case and proceed with targeted discovery in order to help protect the integrity of the 2008 election
2020744 be providing copies of document hold notices to the u s chamber institute for legal reform and the u s justice department for karl rove emails from the white house
2020745 a fraud investigation in a bank but it doesnt when it comes to our vote
2020746 this entire system is being programmed in secret by programmers who have no oversight by anybody
2020747 w e anticipate mr rove will be identified as having engaged in a corrupt ongoing pattern of corrupt activities specifically affecting the situation here in ohio
2020748 works for credit card companies chasing data thieves identity thieves around the globe and also consults with government agencies including the secret service the pentagon and the federal bureau of investigation in criminal matters
2020749 whether the rights privileges and immunities guaranteed to plaintiffs by the civil rights act and the first thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the u s constitution have been violated by the past and ongoing conduct of secretary of state j kenneth blackwell in connection with past elections in ohio
2020750 this was interrupted when the secretary wanted to bring all the ballots that had been ordered preserved by judge marbley bring them in to one location when the ballots came in there was significant omissions and reports of the destruction of some of the ballots
2020751 bobs fitrakis and harvey wassermans book on what happened in ohio documentation of the exit poll discrepancy and john conyers report to the congress which was the factual basis for the challenge to the electoral votes of the ohio vote in january of 2005
2020752 concept of looking at this from a criminal standpoint was not to convene a grand jury and cast the net broadly and use the grand jury process to investigate and narrow the focus into the question of who may have tampered with those votes but rather they wanted us to come to them with a more focused case
2020753 could proceed with the civil case in order to collect discovery to do that
2020754 we think rove is an individual who has been at the center of both the use of corporate money to attack state attorneys general and their elections and candidates for the supreme court and their elections in the states and also in the manipulation of the election process
2020755 we expressed concern about the reports that mr rove destroyed his emails and suggested that we want the duplicates that should exist be put under the control of the secret service and be sure that those are retained as well as those on the receiving end in the justice department and elsewhere that those documents are retained for purposes of this litigation in which we anticipate mr rove will be identified as having engaged in a corrupt ongoing pattern of corrupt activities specifically affecting the situation here in ohio
2020756 to go after the issues of election integrity in a very targeted way as opposed to a casting of a fishing net
2020757 d esigns websites and he manages the information technology interestingly hes done this for the bush campaign of 2000 and the bush campaign of 2004 simultaneously he was doing it work for the state of florida in 2000 and for the office of the ohio secretary of state in 2004
2020758 were not saying that he connell did anything wrong in the sense of his conduct but were saying that these conflicting roles raise some issues
2020759 mr connell also worked with the various front groups for the us chamber tobacco industry front groups and starting in 2000 after the new hampshire primary there was an unleashing of a variety of these washington based lobbying groups that created these phony grass roots groups that attack candidates supposedly independently we believe there is clear evidence of a coordinated campaign in which mr rove is involved in which mr connell is an instrument and this emphasizes his value of a witness in bringing some of this together
2020760 he by virtue of his involvement in a variety of these roles that were concerned with as a witness he can provide a perspective hes the one person who can bring a great deal of information together to better inform folks of what happened and what some of the vulnerabilities are and where some of the data security breaches may have occurred
2020761 you cannot secure electronic voting you set up a bunch of grandmothers to put together a bunch of computers once every two years basically those machines are architected in such a manner to maximize their capacity for fraud
2020762 if you adjust for the connelly anomaly or that situation its enough votes to have changed the outcome of the election so the focus of our efforts in cooperation with the secretary of state would be to find out who is responsible for that
2020763 we need to know that so that the rapp family will be closely monitored if not put in jail before the 2008 election
2020764 i am extremely confident in our analysis of the 2004 election anomalies because of the way the tabulators were programmed and all were programmed by the rapp family ontriad systems so in my opinion there should be an investigation launched into exactly what happened
2020765 certainly if that happened at one of our banks you could be arrested
2020766 when in the green party recount all of the sudden people are driving around the state pulling and swapping hard drives they should have been in handcuffs that day
2020767 has never been interrogated under oath in either a civil or a criminal context to the best of our knowledge
2020768 spoonamore said that he knows the key fbi cyber investigation people
2020769 focus on corrective actions that are necessary for the protection of the 2008 election
2020770 what happens at the end of the day all those votes are thrown into a magic box with one troll inside the troll jumps out and says here are your results ta da thats it theres no validation of the code theres no authentication
2020771 none of us the american people really want to confront the fact that there appears to be an extremely coordinated effort by a very small group of people to rig elections and take control of the executive branch
2020772 you can spend all day every day looking at this stuff and saying well that would certainly launch a fraud investigation in a bank but it doesnt when it comes to our vote why
2020773 no its not its not a bi partisan system this entire system is being programmed in secret by programmers who have no oversight by anybody in my opinion both sides democrats and republicans have no friggin clue what theyre talking about
2020774 the person who programs the code inside the machine will decide the results
2020775 yes ive been a life long member of the republican party sadly
2020776 karl rove was involved in the bush campaign for president in 2000
2020777 at the time the tobacco industry was fighting the clinton administration 260 billion class action rico case
2020778 they turned these groups loose in south carolina they won south carolina with a lot of independent expenditures and dirty tricks
2020779 rove was the architect of a strategy to in effect undo the rule of law turn business loose free of government regulation
2020780 we certainly want to take his roves deposition his deposition has never been taken mr conyers is currently seeking his deposition in regard to what he did in terms of going after governor siegelman in alabama and mr rove is currently evading the congressional subpoena for his testimony
2020781 economic conservatives cringe at mike huckabee conservative evangelicals like huckabee but wince at mitt romney gay rights activists are trying to rule out sam nunn the womens movement is wary of several prominent democrats who support abortion restrictions
2020782 thats the minefield barack obama and john mccain are tiptoeing across as they choose their vice presidential nominees the goal of each to find a running mate who adds appeal to the ticket while steering around the candidates who would leave key groups angry and ready to abandon the party
2020783 now if i could only get her to have sex with me
2020784 some minnesotans cringed others including his wife mary a former judge who met her future husband in law school said he was just being himself joker and all outside his home state mr pawlenty is among the least known of the prospects senator john mccain is said to be considering as a vice presidential partner but those who have followed his political rise here say mr pawlentys personal story his direct everyman appeal to ordinary people is among his most powerful attributes
2020785 romney who was en route to beijing yesterday for todays start of the games personally intervened in cheeks case writing a letter to top chinese government officials and the chinese olympic committee president
2020786 waiting for crist on the helipad at the kings residence was harry sargeant of palm beach county a fraternity brother of crists at florida state university in the 1970s and a supporter of his gubernatorial campaign last year sargeant loaned a corporate jet to crists campaign and sargeants family and companies gave 248 000 to the state republican party in 2006
2020787 but for 263 votes rep eric i cantor r 7th wouldnt be potentially a heartbeat from the presidency
2020788 romney said in a telephone interview from washington between flights
2020789 im a huge sports fan a big baseball fan and so to be able to do anything like this is always really cool

2020792 david wright actually reached out to me towards the end of the
2020793 parker was born at a hospital in north carolina just this morning at 8 08 am wow 8 08 08 08 08
2020794 but if you do kill him i dont want to hear how you do it dont tell me anything about it i dont wanna know
2020795 i turned the faucet on so i could fill up the bucket and drown him but i dont know hes kind of cute
2020796 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
2020797 the last three years youve picked us what second or third and where have we finished second or third if were underachievers yall are picking us as underachievers yall are underachiever pickers weve ended up right where youve picked us the last three years its yalls job to put a label on it underachievers or whatever
2020798 many of the techniques used would be intolerable in a democratic society even if all of the targets had been involved in violent activity but cointelpro went far beyond that
2020799 the bureau conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the exercise of first amendment rights of speech and association on the theory that preventing the growth of dangerous groups and the propagation of dangerous ideas would protect the national security and deter violence
2020800 nearly every week brings news of another act of forced high mindedness
2020801 our security agencies will co operate with the worst of the worst if we or the americans have suspicions about you your canadian citizenship means nothing and your government will let you languish in a hellhole if need be
2020802 the canadian government has a racist mind it is because i am black and muslim
2020803 the quest for genuine human security must be rooted in international human rights standards basic and hard won standards for the just treatment of all people everywhere all the time and under all circumstances no exceptions this is especially true in times of danger and public anxiety when governments use so called necessity to justify the abuse of some people often those who are already the targets of discrimination
2020804 the air conditioner guys are getting their jobs back they sweat so we stay cool
2020805 essentially a protest against the 27 increase in the price of electricity

2020814 well likely continue to use rain tires in nationwide series road course races but not in sprint cup
2020815 we have the flexibility to reschedule postponed cup races to monday or even tuesday something we cant do with our other national series
2020816 we have a number of cars prepared at the shop and our guys were just itching to get back to the race track as we all are
2020817 the assumption in the garage is that im back at red bull but they have the option and havent picked it up yet
2020818 ms grants alleged prior actions are totally irrelevant to this suit
2020819 nascar must obey the law and should focus its full attention on improving the discriminatory and hostile work environment to which employees are subject
2020820 clearly these revelations show that there are always at least two sides to every story
2020821 we are confident that over the course of this process even more facts will come to light and justice will be served
2020822 i cant answer definitively whether or not we would go forward with the transaction
2020823 its one of the potential options that we would have
2020824 its fast and its a track that suits our cars very very well
2020825 i still like the road racing a lot its something that i look at we have probably a 1 in 5 or 1 in 10 shot of winning the race we put a lot of effort into our road racing not that we dont put a lot of effort into our oval racing this is something ive done for 15 years now and i have a lot of experience road racing
2020826 i think its probably difficult each direction the biggest thing on the oval is to back off early get it into the corner then get back on the gas its similar to how i run the road races as well i try to roll the middle as fast as i can and i think thats helped me on the road courses
2020827 but the short ovals i normally run pretty good at so it seems like that works there too
2020828 well i think scott riggs is a very good racecar driver well start there committed to running a second car you know wed love to run a second car i think our team and our facility and our systems and procedures and policies all that stuff is in place now to run a second car
2020829 you know we still havent won with one car but this weekends race hasnt happened yet either its important to make one car run good first and weve been able to stay inside of the top 35 but at the same time wed like to position ourselves to win races
2020830 the competitions so close especially with the new car the way it is today
2020831 i think any race right now is tough to win and i think the competitions close
2020832 i think hell do a good job at it the only words of wisdom that i gave him was and i only mean it in fun and games be careful what you wish for you might get it
2020833 you know its a chore to be the driver and the owner but at the same time provided you hire the right people and they do their job and follow through with it and take ownership in it its not that big of a deal its when you have to get involved in certain situations
2020834 sit in a chair turn the wheel and push pedals
2020835 no i dont think they would have been able to keep up with me
2020836 im very excited to be working with jade on this special class
2020837 he has an incredible amount of experience and he brings a wealth of knowledge from all facets of the motorsports industry
2020838 well likely continue to use rain tires in nationwide series road course races but not in sprint cup
2020839 we have the flexibility to reschedule postponed cup races to monday or even tuesday something we cant do with our other national series
2020840 my first race at watkins glen was last year in the nationwide series
2020841 it was actually my first time seeing the track this being a fairly new track for me it just takes a while getting use to it and learning the course this year i have a little more experience with road courses so i think we have a better chance of improving from last years results
2020842 i have not done all that well on any of the road courses
2020843 we have had some crazy stuff happen to us these past couple of weeks
2020844 we just have to keep our heads up and not focus on the points
2020845 we dont do that much road course racing and we rarely like to test road courses
2020846 we continued to do it through winston cup nextel cup racing
2020847 its like anybody the guy who works at the bank gets close to retirement so he plays more golf im getting close to the end so im starting to race short track more
2020848 strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life
2020849 only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty
2020850 every effort should be made to exclude the use of fire arms especially against children
2020851 with the ever changing dynamics of the travel industry ota will become even more important to both the vendor and supplier communities because implementing the standard has proven cost and efficiency benefits this is a very exciting time for ota and i am honored to help guide the direction of opentravel
2020852 ibs has always had the best industry talent to fulfil our committment to deliver new generation technology solutions that help the travel industry redefine its business we are justifiably proud that alan has been elected to chair the board of directors at ota in which post he is sure to make significant contributions
2020853 this fetish you call moe is a pedophiliac fetish and is nothing more than perversion
2020854 in other countries theyd call what youre fantasizing over child pornography and youd all be arrested
2020855 the whole anthrax case would make for a good journalism class
2020856 80 pages of additional material not previously available in english
2020857 ill pay it back when i graduate and get a job this is an investment in my future darn it
2020858 im one of two republicans in the country polling ahead of a sitting democrat
2020859 my point to you is the process has to change
2020860 one stop shop online do everything photographic site a veritable swiss army knife of a site ephotozine has everything a photographer could wish for
2020861 the s60 embodies a perfect marriage between technology and style nikon has introduced a host of features to make this camera easy to use and packed it with superb innovations derived from our professional d slr line for optimal imaging we are confident that the range of colour options will appeal to those looking for a combination of quality and good looks in a single package
2020862 we will dump the price to wherever it needs to be in order to get to 80
2020863 if passengers are booking ahead of the 80 seat target we will close off the cheap seats if we are booking behind it we will open up more cheap fares
2020864 ultimately it is oil and the operating losses that will force some of these guys to the wall
2020865 airlines are dealing with high oil prices weakening demand and the need to maximise revenues in different ways
2020866 ba is increasing average fares but letting the number of seats sold per flight slip that does not work with ryanairs network or its product plus ryanair is trying to grow at 14 per year while ba is shrinking different growth profiles means different reactions on fares
2020867 if airlines get a break in the oil price some of them will get financing from some idiot the more expensive oil is the faster we roll up the loss making companies that are not going to survive anyway
2020868 it looked a bit like an irregular galaxy but i wasnt sure what it was
2020869 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
2020870 there was a time when i spoke pejoratively of armchair astronomers and ive gotten up at a star party and publicly apologized for that
2020871 we were overwhelmed by the response it completely melted the server
2020872 people tell us its addictive some of the volunteers are professional astronomers but most of them are not theyre just regular people who got excited about the project
2020873 my astronomy background doesnt really go further than looking at the stars when walking outside in the evening
2020874 its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
2020875 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
2020876 its amazing to think that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
2020877 what excites me the most is that all of this leads to more interest in science
2020878 heavy armed vehicles artillery and tanks have stepped in and there are victims the killed wounded including amid russias peacekeepers
2020879 its very sad and very alarming and will certainly entail the response putin is in beijing where the olympic games open today rf security council members today
2020880 we were pleased during the second quarter to see a 14 price increase for all of our natural gas production in poland which became effective may 1st we continue to see a strong gas market in poland going forward these higher prices and resulting higher cash flows together with our cash on hand and unused credit capacity will provide the means for us to continue to execute our 2008 capital budget
2020881 jeg er rigtig tilfreds med vores start p s sonen vi har spillet ti kampe p 34 dage og har kun tabt to jeg er overbevist om at vi har holdet der kan n helt til tops i ligaen og i uefa cuppens gruppespil jeg f ler at vi har noget at have vores ambitioner i
2020882 vi har lige solgt en angriber og s er det n rliggende at kigge p en erstatning s det g r vi selvf lgelig men samtidig holder vi fast i at vi kun k ber hvis vi f ler at det er en spiller som virkelig bidrager til at styrke truppen
2020883 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
2020884 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
2020885 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
2020886 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
2020887 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago
2020888 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
2020889 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
2020890 theyve agreed in principle to a set code of conduct
2020891 this is the three internet groups we named directly google yahoo and microsoft in addition to a large number of other stakeholders human rights groups ngos other technology firms theyve all agreed in principle to this code we dont anticipate the final agreement and the final language of this code to be finished for another few weeks perhaps i would estimate it sometime in september
2020892 over the next few months the initiative will be finalizing organizational steps we anticipate a more detailed public announcement to launch the initiative sometime this fall
2020893 some companies continue to be very resistant to the idea of independent monitoring
2020894 therell be a separate organization that will independently audit and manage the agreement they will be in charge of assurance
2020895 microsoft will block access to windows live spaces content only where we receive a legally binding notice from a government indicating that the material violates local laws or if the content violates our terms of use
2020896 there are some limits to what the companies can practically do and what they say are willing to agree to do in the face of a government demand
2020897 our hope is that a code of conduct like this will embolden any company to think first when faced with a government demand that contradicts international human rights agreements
2020898 remain tied through common threads that emerge formally though the use of geometric shapes and the manipulation of planes in space
2020899 just the movement downward in oil over the last couple of weeks i view as helpful in the whole equation
2020900 we are planning to spend a great deal of time looking at that over the next couple of months
2020901 we are operating in a very difficult environment and our results generated one of the smallest reductions in second quarter margins among north american carriers
2020902 the second quarter result demonstrated the difficulty of increasing revenues at the same rapid pace as the increase in the price of jet fuel however our customers will eventually have to absorb the higher cost
2020903 we have long cautioned that domestic supply growth could outpace demand growth in 2008 and hence air canadas decision to trim capacity growth is clearly a positive for the industry as a whole
2020904 i have a friend who i bet a dollar that the mets will win more games than the yankees this year i still think its money in the bank
2020905 we want to be the it department for small and medium businesses
2020906 judging by the rapid growth of our user population that vision resonates with the smb customers like prestige home automation who are adopting our online business applications and collaborative productivity applications
2020907 if i have to spend a lot of time implementing software that takes time away from selling and implementing products which is my business i dont earn anything when im implementing software for internal use
2020908 strange red haired bearded one eyed man with a limp
2020909 but i do think bryan has overestimated the case in favor of abolition or at least should take a more nuanced stance
2020910 in the changing face of beijing a look at the new china
2020911 this community will engage a diverse group of people who truly care about education and want to exchange ideas that inspire the next generation of innovators
2020912 the future of our increasingly connected world depends on our ability to innovate and deliver the next breakthrough in medicine business renewable energy mobility and entertainment clearly education is very important to us
2020913 strange red haired bearded one eyed man with a limp
2020914 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
2020915 well we find that we can usually correct under or over exposure pretty easily with the exposure compensation function
2020916 i was instructed by my chief that all releases in so far as government house is to be made by mr shawn gumataotao
2020917 scout 2 was called was activated or responded to government house for a reported stove fire what had happened after that they arrived at government house kitchen the security escorted them to the kitchen where the fire occurred where it was extinguished by the hood and duct system extinguishment system
2020918 they had also come upon and individual that was uninvited and there was indication that there was some inappropriate activity possibly related to controlled substance and so that is being looked into
2020919 i still decided to go ahead and meet with them and find out if they were ok and what process they used to take care of that and they indicated that the fire department was called and the fire personnel handled that

2020928 this decision was taken in haste they are playing with fire
2020929 bom sou um jovem anarquista muito interessado em ajudar a construir uma organiza o libert ria que ande ombro a ombro com o movimento social com unidade ideol gica unidade pratica responsabilidade e autodisciplina
2020930 amigos de s o paulo com muita alegria vejo o ideal libert rio e anarquista se estabelecer em uma frente que fortalecer nossas for as dentro de outras organiza es e correntes minando aos poucos as influencias bolcheviques que h tanto tempo atrapalham a luta pela emancipa o humana atrav s de seus autoritarismo que leva burocratiza o em que tantos sindicatos se encontram hoje pela horizontalidade participa o direta e pela constru o do federalismo em nossa sociedade viva a fasp
2020931 temos que travar uma luta inexor vel pela reforma do latif ndio da terra fundi rio do latif ndio do saber acad mico euroc ntrico e do latif ndio do espectro magn tico midi tico
2020932 engra ado que quando comecei a tentar compreender a id ia anarquista eu mesmo achava algo imposs vel j tinha um pr conceito antes de conhecer mas tendo algumas experi ncias com alguns militantes de partidos que dizem lutar pela liberdade e igualdade aqui na minha cidade que ambas as vis es t m um objetivo de estar no poder seja qualquer pre o ent o me perguntava como estes que falavam que estavam do lado dos oprimidos agiam de forma preconceituosa e j err nea j que eles v m os cidad os de cima para baixo eu percebi que por mais que fosse utopia para uns a id ia libertaria que n o verdade realmente ela busca uma forma de mudan a legitima ap s isso me interessei ainda mais a id ia anarquista mas h muito a ver e apreender
2020933 no momento n o participo de nenhum movimento social e nem conhe o muito sobre a pr fasp penso que essa seria uma tima oportunidade para conhecer j que ser o primeiro encontro comecei a me interessar pelo ideal anarquista e obter informa es dentro dos ccs tenho muito interesse nesse tipo de assunto mas como j citei n o participo de nenhum movimento social ou organiza o e n o tenho experi ncia com organiza es assim penso ser essa uma tima oportunidade de conhecer e me empenhar neste ideal
2020934 vejo que a direita e os capitalistas s o muito unidos a maior prova disso que nosso governo de direita n s anarquistas e grupos sociais de esquerda precisamos nos unir todas as c lulas precisam formar um organismo vivo e ativo
2020935 a todos que aqui participarem mantenham sempre a sinceridade em rela o ao ideal anarquista
2020936 fico feliz com a iniciativa de organiza o deste encontro e espero que a partir dele possamos ampliar nossa rede estudos organiza o e pr tica
2020937 a organiza o anarquista deve surgir assim como o anarquismo atrav s da necessidade e da afinidade dos indiv duos funcionando como um catalisador da revolta gerada pela explora o e manipula o do povo e de suas organiza es populares
2020938 h uma necessidade de nos organizarmos pois o mundo se encontra submerso em um mar de aliena o sustentada por este sistema cruel racista e sanguin rio cujo o nico sentido est em lucrar sobre o sangue de inocentes vamos nos organizar e lutar
2020939 a total falta de discuss o dentro das diferentes propostas de organiza o devem ser superadas pela necessidade imediata de inser o nos movimentos de massa
2020940 que haja mais dialogo e respeito entre os grupos e ou indiv duos respeito a diversidade e op es que cada um faz sobre como cada um prefere lutar n o h um s caminho para o anarquismo mas sim m ltiplos e cada um se completa
2020941 um movimento que tem tudo para crescer pois h realmente pessoas capacitadas talvez ainda seja pequeno mas com um n cleo forte com id ias grandes capaz de se desenvolver atrav s de troca de informa es
2020942 passamos por muitos problemas principalmente problemas de ego e isto atrapalha muito perdemos mais tempo brigando entre n s do que contra aqueles que devem ser combatidos precisamos criar f runs de discuss es com mais freq ncia
2020943 o movimento anarquista em s o paulo est praticamente na m o de movimentos
2020944 bem vejo muita fofoca e pouca solidariedade no movimento muitas vezes o meu coletivo cave e muitos companheiros de luta como por exemplo o mo sio foram atacados por pessoas do movimento que nunca nos perguntaram como se dava a luta aqui na baixada esperamos que com este encontro e outros do tipo isto se resolva pelo menos entre aqueles de boa vontade
2020945 infelizmente h muita descontinuidade nos trabalhos e organiza es anarquistas em s o paulo desde final dos anos 1980 e muita divis o entre as correntes e grupos
2020946 assim como em diferentes lugares a proposta anarquista tem sido depreciada enquanto viabilidade pol tica de enfrentamento ao estado e ao capital aparentemente s o paulo demonstra ser um local de muitas tend ncias que divergem quanto as estrat gias e t ticas para se alcan ar isso as que tem pelo menos isso comum em todos os cantos entretanto o que n o se pode impedir associar e enfatizar a falta de comprometimento daqueles que reivindicaram um anarquismo social organizado e comprometido com uma concep o social de transforma o
2020947 o movimento composto por v rios grupos e indiv duos que desenvolvem trabalhos valorosos dentro de suas especificidade por m acredito que existe muita falta de respeito e generaliza es principalmente com n s que somos anarco punks

2020951 its closely observed portrayal of what goes on in the corridors of power has given me hours of pure joy
2020952 now an international body will have the opportunity to demand that the united states hold accountable those responsible for mr amezianes torture and abuse
2020953 guards then cuffed and chained him and took him to an interrogation room where he was left for several hours writhing in pain his clothes soaked while air conditioning blasted in the room and his body burning from the pepper spray
2020954 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo
2020955 because we the congolese we want peace we are tired of this foreign sponsored war and instability
2020956 when you wake up you will have a insatiable desire to buy me some tuna fish
2020957 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
2020958 a typical indian gamer is a city bred youth who has no idea about traditional indian games
2020959 we feel that the indian gaming market with its current growth has reached a level where a new concept like this can be tried and we expect it to do very well we are delighted to be partnering with gameshastra in this endeavor and have every belief that it will be a huge success
2020960 clients perceptions of how reorientation therapy and self help can promote changes in sexual orientation
2020961 evidence from the uk shows that one out of five homosexual marriages wont see their 21st anniversary
2020962 as the hed but i realized immediately after i wrote it that there was a problem namely it was a little too cute with regard to mr pitts current family status what with his being stepdad to a bunch of orphans and everything it sounded a lot like i was making fun of him and or those kids
2020963 its 90 degree weather but im getting a head start on my fall wardrobe staples
2020964 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
2020965 there was a time when i spoke pejoratively of armchair astronomers and ive gotten up at a star party and publicly apologized for that
2020966 we were overwhelmed by the response it completely melted the server
2020967 people tell us its addictive some of the volunteers are professional astronomers but most of them are not theyre just regular people who got excited about the project
2020968 my astronomy background doesnt really go further than looking at the stars when walking outside in the evening
2020969 its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
2020970 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
2020971 its amazing to think that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
2020972 what excites me the most is that all of this leads to more interest in science
2020973 you need to call the police we dont handle these types of problems i am not dr phil
2020974 for just about any groundpounding type soldier you train to fight
2020975 the difficulty isnt that weve gone from kinetic major combat to non kinetic the difficulty is that weve gone from kinetic to non kinetic so fast
2020976 there has been a significant change over the last year or two in the mentality as well as the skill set and the operating principles that the army is using to prepare forces and that army forces now have
2020977 its partly a function of people having been on several tours to iraq but its in a large part a function of the way the institution itself has begun to accept iraq and afghanistan
2020978 last time in 2006 it was almost three or four times a week that we had to call in a platoon and re look at the statements and ask them about the evidence
2020979 it needs to change some of this non kinetic work needs to start getting drummed in back at garrison instead of these three week field problems where we go out and conduct nothing but kinetic operations
2020980 for me a lot of the impulse came out of being labeled an international anarchist when in fact im a christian democrat
2020981 we are praying that the former military base be transformed into a new childrens hospital for all the little ones of palestine we are praying that the peaceful people of beit sahour do not lose their homes to new israeli settlements we are praying that israel stands by its promise to the people of beit sahour that the army will allow the people of beit sahour to build this hospital
2020982 let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night and when you move fall like a thunderbolt
2020983 if they are so concerned why dont they test the guys too
2020984 the press sisters are always mentioned as an example of successful deterrent they stopped competing before the testing started at the grenoble winter games but nobody mentions the fact that the press sisters along with many other communist athletes were suspected of being kept on a steroids regime by their governments
2020985 its only the department of defense that is big enough and has the federal mandate for the necessary scope of development
2020986 while it is not wrong that tepco has completed demonstration tests for devices that charge batteries we do not at this time have plans to take the initiative in setting up charging locations within the city
2020987 create a harder problem for us we are seeing that more and more
2020988 to have a device that can look into the ground and detect at a very low false positive rate a pressure plate thats under there
2020989 who it would be nice to have a beer with
2020990 we completed fiscal 2008 with a 44 improvement in new product introductions as measured by engineering content this marks two consecutive years of improvement and should serve as the catalyst for future growth the increase in our engineering productivity the effectiveness of our recent focus on margins and the successful realignment of our business units give maxim management confidence that we will grow revenue and earnings when the macro economic environment improves additionally further reduction in capital expenditures during fiscal 2009 should increase our free cash flow in light of this i am pleased to announce that maxims board of directors has approved a 6 7 increase in our quarterly dividend from 0 1875 per share to 0 20 per share
2020991 what the fucks he talking about lower taxes smaller govt

2020998 the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
2020999 i am not a racist i never made a racist comment
2021000 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win
2021001 in his first presidential race governor clinton ran for office supporting the death penalty at a time when the country was split almost down the middle on the issue then for good measure he rushed back to arkansas to oversee the execution of convicted killer ricky ray rector a brain damaged black man for years after his first election i kept a picture of clinton and georgia senator sam nunn posing in front of a phalanx of black inmates in white prison suits taken at stone mountain georgia historians generally give pulaski tennessee the dubious honor as the birthplace of the ku klux klan but stone mountain is hailed as the klans second home the picture appeared in newspapers all across the south the day of the southern primaries in 1992 that picture is what clinton has always represented to me
2021002 fucking cunt with a nappy headed ho hairstyle get the fuck out you fugly bitch
2021003 we came here looking for the best and the brightest but instead we get you
2021004 as the disk is one of the greatest archaeological finds of crete and an important attraction not only for scholars but especially for tourists
2021005 the journalistic peer review process was a great deal easier to sneak through
2021006 we have decided not to return fire for a certain period of time this move is yet another attempt by us to convince the separatists that a military confrontation is pointless
2021007 military confrontation may lead to many casualties so we are ready to hold talks and defuse tensions
2021008 we are unilaterally ceasing fire but we are doing it not because we are afraid of anyone but because we want peace we hope that this message will be properly received by them the south ossetian side and that they will stop shelling our civilian population
2021009 and kokoity the south ossetian secessionist leader is not in tskhinvali
2021010 they all joined together constantly in prayer along with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brothers
2021011 during maos cultural revolution in china another christian community faced a hostile empire red guards mostly university and high school students flooded into cities towns and villages and systematically persecuted anyone they believed in violation of mao thought as many as 100 million people were victimized through torture and imprisonment in forced labor camps one million were executed to be caught in possession of a bible meant torture and imprisonment at the very least in 1949 when mao came to power there were about 4 million christians in china today there may be as many as 100 million henan province once considered an atheistic zone was said by the authorities to have caught christianity fever i asked a china expert why christianity took its genuine great leap forward during the darkest days of the cultural revolution he said light shines in darkness christians find that the bibles authority its textual integrity its historical accuracy and its transformative power attest to its unique status as gods word
2021012 the faith given once for all what christians believe why they believe it and why it matters
2021013 all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work
2021014 the don an innovative strategy meta game that allows players to oversee the entire world as they grow the family business using the don
2021015 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the don
2021016 the videogame takes the story and gameplay to the next level with an innovative open world action strategy that is both compelling and intriguing for gamers
2021017 greater love has no man than this that he gives up his life for his friends
2021018 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
2021019 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
2021020 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
2021021 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
2021022 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago
2021023 if as some kind of gesture we said no to new coal fired power stations we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this technology ourselves it requires some new coal powered fire stations for the technology to develop
2021024 world demand for coal is projected to rise by 70 by 2030 an average annual rate of 2 2 and the bulk of the rise will come from india and china china is a nation built on coal so the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft

2021239 its not fake i dont think so its all over the international scene
2021240 wait a minute what does that even mean does it mean what ive always thought it means if not in the presence of how many people have i incorrectly used it in my past and just how embarrassed should i feel

2021279 we discovered that levels of several key pathway members are reduced in drosophila neural tissue as a normal part of aging
2021280 which suggests there is an age dependent suppression of autophagy that may be a contributing factor for human neurodegenerative disorders like alzheimers disease
2021281 the activation of autophagy facilitates the removal of damaged molecules that accumulate during cellular aging
2021282 this may be particularly important in the nervous system since neurons produce damaged molecules at a much higher rate than most cell types
2021283 they rely on autophagy together with other clearance and detoxification pathways to keep themselves healthy and functioning for decades
2021284 the abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates had striking similarities to those seen in the most common human neurodegenerative diseases
2021285 our experiments show for the first time genetically that autophagy can sequester and eliminate misfolded and damaged proteins which accumulate in neurons as normal part of the aging process
2021286 but most importantly they demonstrate that enhancing the clearance of damaged proteins and protein aggregates increases longevity
2021287 by maintaining the expression of a rate limiting autophagy gene in the aging nervous system there is a dramatic extension of lifespan and resistance to age associated oxidative stress

2021302 we were tired of seeing the candidates tip toe around the issues and merely pay lip service so we created this questionnaire posing specific policy questions for the candidates to answer
2021303 the first phone call i placed was answered cordially i was told that someone would get back to me i never heard back from anyone
2021304 the second time i called the person i was speaking with hung up and the third time i called the line was disconnected
2021305 it is clear to me that the mccain campaign is not interested in speaking to the issues
2021306 we believe that they owe it not only to us to respond to the questionnaire but to their base
2021307 if they dont respond at that point we can only surmise that they do not take the latino community seriously and are truly delivering nothing more than political pandering to get the latino vote

2021380 naturally you dont want to have a quarterback hand it off 12 plays in a row if we are trying to evaluate the quarterbacks
2021381 so there will be a little bit more of the passing i would imagine just so we can get a better look but after that the game takes priority
2021382 its important starting the preseason i want to go out there and play well obviously from the quarterback position but also from an offensive standpoint we want to move the ball be successful score touchdowns you know do all the things were supposed to do
2021383 its not something i think about as being a major or minor step its just this is my role right now im just going to go out there and do my job execute the offense as well as i can and play each play and go from there
2021384 my role as far as how im preparing for and planning to execute the offense doesnt change at all im going out there to try to play as well as i can play and those are the things i can control
2021385 i did i started the third game in preseason last year
2021386 i mean its just great reps its something you cant diminish how important those reps are for a quarterback whether it be in the preseason or regular season reps with the first team against the first defense is something that you cant duplicate on the practice field so you have to take advantage of every situation you get an opportunity in
2021387 theres some gossip about it but i try not to get involved in it ill leave it up to the coaches

2021407 we had our best finish of the season so far at sonoma and we were able to turn that very same car around in order to use it at watkins glen this weekend
2021408 david showed that hes extremely good at it with our performance at sonoma back in june when he finished second
2021409 our plan is to do the same thing we did at sonoma work on our track position from a strong qualifying effort and then just to keep the car on the race track during the race
2021410 were bringing the same car we ran at sonoma with a couple tweaks to make it compatible with watkins glen hopefully david will be as happy with the car this weekend as he was at sonoma so that we can get the same results or even one better than we did there

2021412 mccains campaign is returning about 50 000 raised by a florida oil executive because some of the funds were collected by a foreign national and came from donors who may not support the candidate aides said yesterday
2021413 the decision to return the money follows a report in the washington post that found that harry sargeant iii submitted a bundle of checks for 2 300 and 4 600 on a single day in march all of them from donors in southern california who had never given before this years campaign and did not appear to be likely candidates to contribute as much as 18 400 per household
2021414 the warning letter is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives

2021422 plus those tampa bay pitchers are all entering uncharted territory in innings pitched
2021423 hughes boasts a good fastball that works comfortably in the mid 90s
2021424 i for one am surprised to learn 92 93 is the
2021425 its that half rule like when you get to 5 you round up to 10 but when you get to 92 5 you can round up to 95
2021426 andy sonnanstine last year 130 2 this year already 133 2
2021427 matt garza 2006 50 ip 2007 83 ip this year already 129 0
2021428 shields 2006 124 2 2007 215 0 this year 151 1
2021429 kazmir ok i admit hes a horse but has already been hurt this year right
2021430 jackson 2003 2006 22 0 36 1 ip last year 161 this year already 130 0
2021431 all i know is the phil hughes i saw pitch last year vs texas was a pitcher that was better than joba chamberlain
2021432 they should name a flower after phil since he is so precious and delicate
2021433 then you were watching a different game than everyone else
2021434 what he needs is to be tougher perhaps this adversity will give him the toughness necessary to take it to the next level
2021435 what he needs is to be tougher perhaps this adversity will give him the toughness necessary to take it to the next level
2021436 at that time he was one of the best pitching prospects in the game
2021437 its not a matter of toughness if youre injured youre injured that has nothing to do with toughness trying to be tough generally just makes the injury worse and puts you out of action for longer
2021438 so just bring up a guy from the minors to close that will work out great
2021439 its always my go to pitch because a well located fastball is the best pitch in the game im generally sitting between 92 and 94 mph with it and ill touch 95 96 im mostly going with 4 seamers although ill throw a few 2 seamers that are closer to 91 92
2021440 did anybody catch rick sutcliff say he thought that when joba came back he would spend next year in the pen i am glad his health is good but is there any analyst more ignorant does he pay any attention
2021441 if hughes is a failure theres a whole lot of top prospects around baseball should be called
2021442 papelbon was told because of his shoulder he would be better off as a closer physically i gotta wonder if joba might have been told the same thing
2021443 papelbon was told because of his shoulder he would be better off as a closer physically
2021444 papelbon has a shoulder defect which is why he was limited in how much he could pitch it is monitored constantly but longevity for his career is questionable the closer role was thought to be tougher on him because of the lack of scheduled pitching but the starter role has a lot more pitches neither is idea for his shoulder problems
2021445 anyone who still thinks joba should be a reliever after watching him start should probably just give up baseball
2021446 would you call the guy an idiot to his face
2021447 its a very real question as to whether or not he can handle throwing 200 innings as a starter that will be a very interesting off season question for the yankees
2021448 where has anyone suggested he should be a reliver reading comprehension classes might be a good idea
2021449 we expected too much from him me my self i still like him better in the pen
2021450 last year you guys was saying joba is the truth in the pen now all of a sudden you guys saying joba is the best starter yanks have
2021451 i never said he is a horrible starter i just prefer him in the pen i think he should have been transition to be the yankees new closer mo is getting old
2021452 either way if he doesnt pitch anymore this year hes only going to be able to give them 120 130 innings next year we end up going back to figuring out what is the best way to maximize those innings for 2009
2021453 either way if he doesnt pitch anymore this year hes only going to be able to give them 120 130 innings next year
2021454 the look of a farm girl i find that a girl who can pick her teeth regardless of how many see has or doesnt have with straw is very sexy
2021455 i vant da see just like tec i want eberyone to know i am dee cacherrr
2021456 guess it is old news but the rockies pick up livan hernandez i thought for sure with joba going down for a while that the yankees would pick up livan
2021457 they very well may have but they never had the chance the rockies put in a waiver claim and i think they had priority over the yankees
2021458 he receives a full no trade clause in 2006 and a limited no trade clause in 2007 and 2008 that allows him to veto trades to eight teams bos bal det was mil tam fla and pit
2021459 nope al team has priority over nl team in this situation
2021460 giles is a 10 and 5 guy cant be traded without his approval waivers or no waivers
2021461 the scranton game will be televised can i watch this in nyc
2021462 what a joke i guess to get all the praise around here you need to get injured two years in a row and do not much of anything but melky well he should just be dfad asap because he isnt bernie in his prime
2021463 boston lost a decent pitcher and good prospect in the gagne deal too bad they won despite his contributions
2021464 we here at blog headquarters still believe in phil hughes
2021465 good news yankees plan to have andrew brackman pitching against live batters in a couple of weeks and in hawaii this winter hopefully hell have the same post hawaii experience in 2009 that joba had in 2007
2021466 not saying melky will do the same and he frustrates the hell out of me but he is young
2021467 who the hell is dr beaverman and where did he say stuff about joba
2021468 are you seriously considering melky to phil hughes i like melky but phil hughes gets praised for his ability not for what hes accomplished in the majors yet he has shown last year what hes capable of and thats what he gets praise for and that praise is really more like anticipation of what he can become more than anything melky is a good defensive centerfielder who has been terrible at the plate all year all year as someone who likes melky im not one to say he has no ability with the bat he has shown decent ability with the bat before but its august 7 and he has shown almost no hitting ability this year phil hughes projects to be a 1 or 2 starter most people think melky projects to be a 4th outfielder not exactly a good comparison
2021469 hughes will be fine if his velocity is back up to where it was last year before the injury
2021470 we had an area scout go see him and then rusty saw him and he was hitting 95 mph and 98 mph
2021471 btw anybody realize what total loserdom nom ss has become all they can do is rip on people theyre like a bunch of junior high schoolers with no original thoughts
2021472 does all of santanas scoring come off of solo hr
2021473 my point about where they project is simply that hughes has already shown ability to dominate major league hitting what he has to show now is that he can stay healthy the reality is neither player has lived up to their potential as of yet nor should we expect that from a 22 and 24 year old
2021474 my point about where they project is simply that hughes has already shown ability to dominate major league hitting
2021475 they should name a flower after phil since he is so precious and delicate
2021476 its awfully nice of everybody to give phil franchise the benefit of the doubt while he sits around while at the same time trashing melky for actually going out there and doing something but it makes no sense
2021477 there are two new strains of flowers named rockdabronx and bronx jeers they are part of the blooming idiot family of flowers
2021478 the one thing that affects a pitcher most is injuries to his arm and that never happened
2021479 yankees believe their post draft physical has found a rather significant shoulder problems obviously bittle says he is fine and wants a huge amount of the yankees are wise to walk away unless he lowers his demands
2021480 pete abuses his platform to express his likes and dislikes
2021481 you can break a rib with a sneeze that is why it is called a freak injury i know someone who messed up their shoulder catching a door moose injuried is foot last year taking a awkward step down the stairs
2021482 many people seem to forget that hughes just turned 22
2021483 100 absolutely true story i knew a girl who broke two ribs having sex
2021484 giles can veto a trade to boston and he might simply because his playing time could be reduced also i have learned that giles would still be able to veto a straight salary dump the padres cant use this situation to sneak around giles no trade clause
2021485 pete abuses his platform to express his likes and dislikes
2021486 i knew a girl who broke two ribs having sex
2021487 chris i understand that leg injuries can change a pitcher but shoulder and elbow injuries can prevent them from ever being the same or coming back again leg injuries just take a fix in mechanics but rarely take a career away
2021488 and by the way not everybody is a mariano rivera a mariano rivera is a once in a lifetime pitcher us yankee fans have been spoiled to say the least having a closer like him shut down our ballgames new york is in for a rude awakening when that man retires
2021489 which decent prospect did cashman give up for marte nady

2021494 a lot of it pointed to the son up until the point they found kelly
2021495 she really had a lot of zest for life and enthusiasm she was my girl she loved nature and all the animals in it
2021496 i wonder sometimes when i watch all these other cases go so quickly
2021497 there have been a lot of homicides here in maine and people have been charged so quickly but you know different circumstances i guess
2021498 its bad enough losing her but to think that someone would not pay the consequences for it would be totally not acceptable

2021505 how do you raise 5 billion when the market thinks your entire company is only worth 4 billion
2021506 investors need to believe good news is around the corner to give a company more money and freddie mac has said there is more bad news to come we dont think theyre going to be able to raise it
2021507 we believe we can manage to maintain our capital position for some time
2021508 were not going to rush to raise capital because we dont have to
2021509 we have disclosed the range of pain we can take and we think it demonstrates the company is positioning itself to withstand severe stress
2021510 freddie and fannie have been propping up the mortgage market by continuing to buy larger numbers of loans
2021511 if they start pulling back mortgage rates are going to start climbing to north of 6 5 percent people will start panicking at 7 percent
2021512 they are the only game in town right now and if freddie and fannie can make it out of this theyll be enormously profitable down the road
2021513 now the big question is what will they look like when they make it through this crisis and how bad will it get until its over
2021514 naturally if the political authorities of russia resolve to use as peacekeeping forces the divisions stationed in the chechen republic we will endeavor to make this mission successful

2021519 especially given the recent transformation of consoles from historically teen focused gaming devices to now becoming family entertainment hubs in many living rooms across the globe we are very focused on titles that satisfy this new broad demographic
2021520 we enjoyed working with gameshastra on tumblebugs 2 pc and are excited to collaborate again to bring our games to the emerging realm of console casual gaming the broad consumer appeal and high production values of wildfires titles make them a natural fit for the console space
2021521 after working closely with the wildfire team to create background art for tumblebugs 2 we realized the game was a fantastic wiiware candidate
2021522 the key to a successful wii port is the ability to expand the title to take advantage of the unique wiimote input system and we feel we have came up with a very innovative design that combines the regular shoot to match 3 experience with some very unique wii specific mechanics

2021524 this sort of attack is shocking and reprehensible but unfortunately it is not surprising
2021525 it is not surprising when supporters of animal rights use violence and intimidation because their cause is fundamentally anti human
2021526 animal activists claim that their goal is to stop gratuitous torture inflicted for no reason
2021527 all of this is based on the false notion that animals have rights
2021528 it is a mistake to regard these criminals as extremists who are hijacking an otherwise valid cause it is the cause of animal rights itself that is vicious and anti human

2021626 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
2021627 the discovery of such a large population of western lowland gorillas is absolutely fantastic news for the sub species and for conservationists but we should be careful not to be too complacent
2021628 the area where these gorillas have been found is in the path of the ebola virus which has wiped out large numbers of western lowland gorillas during the past 25 years
2021629 numbers are less important than trends and sadly the trend for all gorilla sub species apart from the mountain gorillas has been a downturn in population figures

2021708 in an interview last year attorney robert barron a shareholder at berger singerman said creation of vulture funds is a logical outcome of the credit crunch but the funds could bring unforeseen repercussions all around
2021709 one problem is that whatever the discounted units sell at will become the comparable sales price for the project he said and that will indirectly affect other buyers who have to get financing

2021734 a cheerful sign outside the glistening offices of bank united beckons consumers to tap into mortgage ade another promises a 59 minute mortgage but easy money it turns out has created enormous problems at bank united floridas biggest regional bank
2021735 by aggressively peddling a popular type of high interest loan to risky borrowers the bank tripled its profits in 2006 as real estate on floridas gold coast peaked only to lose nearly 100 million in late 2007 and early 2008 as the market cratered now its ceo alfred r camner is scrambling to raise 400 million in capital an amount nearly eight times the banks shriveled value on the stock market
2021736 in an interview mr camner who is also the banks controlling shareholder testily defended the banks strategy we did it for over 10 years he said referring to the banks use of a risky but highly attractive product known as an option adjustable rate mortgage
2021737 for a very long time it was an excellent performing package
2021738 the strategy proved lucrative bank uniteds assets more than doubled to 15 billion from 7 1 billion in 2003 while its total loans rose to 12 5 billion from 3 9 billion by last october the end of the banks fiscal year mr camner had allowed option adjustable rate mortgages to dwarf overall mortgages three to one
2021739 bank united found itself on a particularly slippery slope as its newfound base of risky regional borrowers eroded from mid 2006 to early 2008 the percentage of its assets designated as nonperforming soared more than fivefold to 4 75 percent

2021791 at least 518 existing single family houses were sold in fresno and clovis in july but about 51 were bank owned said don scordino president of the fresno association of realtors
2021792 andrew lepage an analyst for dataquick said increasing sales is a positive trend but that a strong recovery wont occur until the foreclosures begin to fade and the inventory of unsold homes shrinks
2021793 the sales bottom is the first bottom youll see and then there will be a price bottom we dont see that he said
2021794 a snapshot of bakersfields home sales in july shows a jump in volume fueled by bank owned properties and declining prices according to a report from local appraiser gary crabtree

2021798 newport beach based mka capital group advisors llc has been running a ponzi scheme on its investors according to a newport beach couple suing the company
2021799 according to the lawsuit filed in orange county superior court july 28 mka capital group a real estate investment management firm worth between 400 million and 500 million has been using new investors money to cover losses suffered by the groups opportunity fund investors the opportunity fund is a fund created to make loans to real estate developers in hopes of turning a profit

2021801 no one in their right mind would make such a guarantee said dan white general counsel for mka capital group
2021802 there is no shortage of gloom in the southern california housing market as one key indicator recently saw home values in los angeles fall 24 5 percent from a year ago but those spiraling fortunes are helping barrington malcolm build a dynasty
2021803 malcolm runs dynasty dynamics inc a multimillion dollar privately owned property company that keeps a low profile but has been a major player in the high stakes california real estate market for more than 20 years
2021804 malcolm is quickly becoming the california bankers best friend acquiring properties at significant discounts and remodeling them for sale at a profit
2021805 for instance in june malcolm bought a house in leimert park for 249 000 and within four weeks the remodeled property was listed for 439 000 right now his company is in negotiations to buy four properties at the cove condominiums in marina del rey the high rise luxury apartments which people were snapping up for a 1 million plus are now going for half that
2021806 the first season of million dollar listing a reality series on bravo that follows real estate agents in hollywood and malibu calif was broadcast two years ago and already feels like material from a time capsule
2021807 the show captured a giddy period in which a cash strapped seller could list a shabby 1960s contemporary in the hollywood hills for close to 1 3 million get an offer above asking price and still debate whether to make the deal
2021808 the current housing market of course is much gloomier especially in los angeles considering how emotionally fraught the subject of residential real estate has become most fans of million dollar listing probably figured the show which was off the air last year had gone the way of the subprime loan
2021809 but this week a second season made its debut and the channel has bravely stuck with the name and the format instead of steering the show in a more topical direction like million dollar foreclosure
2021810 still one wonders how a series that owed its popularity in large part to the go go real estate market and the national housing obsession that that market created will be affected by the mortgage crisis
2021811 obviously the market is different today said andy cohen the senior vp for programming and production at bravo
2021812 beverly hills or not market realities are evident in the first episode one seller an interior designer looking to unload his renovated condo wants to party like its 2005 and chad rogers must persuade him to be realistic about the asking price
2021813 the seller pouts then pulls the listing according to the lone holdover from season 1 madison hildebrand unrealistic sellers are common these days as are price reductions and slow turnarounds on high end homes even in malibu now the average time is eight months he said with a sigh the other day
2021814 he said a small two bedroom house on the 2300 block of oakwood drive was appraised at around 600 000 just 18 months ago in february woods said it went to auction for 189 000 and didnt sell
2021815 the median price of a home in june 2007 was 497 000 said cohn
2021816 right now were getting through the inventory of foreclosure and short sale properties and once we burn through that well see slow appreciation every year
2021817 a group of alma college students will arrive in the city next week and at once go to work picking cherries on the peninsula a number of the growers having made arrangements for their services with the assistance of the college boys the lack of help will not be felt so much as usual this year
2021818 for instance in june malcolm bought a house in leimert park for 249 000 and within four weeks the remodeled property was listed for 439 000
2021819 on the 1100 block of sage street a home that was appraised 18 months ago at about 635 000 went to auction a few months ago and also didnt sell the lender is now selling it on the market for 289 000 woods said

2021823 the median price of a home in june 2007 was 497 000 said cohn
2021824 what bugs me is people that couldnt see a bubble coming are going to tell me when the market will return to
2021825 after a precipitous decline spurred by the highest foreclosure rates in marin there are signs that the value of novatos real estate may be nearing stabilization whats happened is that there were a lot of short sales there are so many real estate owned properties its a buyers market said patti cohn of frank howard allen

2021830 to provide borrowers additional time to work with their servicers to explore alternatives to foreclosure
2021831 among the policy changes freddie mac announced last week to encourage servicers to avoid repossessing homes was one allowing servicers to take more time to process foreclosure actions in the district of columbia and 20 states
2021832 when newport beach couple john and cynthia gates invested 3 million into the opportunity fund in july 2007 they say they were promised a 12 annual profit on that investment and that there was virtually no risk of losing money their attorney gary steinberg said instead for whatever reason their money was used to cover losses earlier investors had suffered the lawsuit claims
2021833 we cant solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
2021834 home users at this point are more likely than not to be operating behind a protected environment in fact its probably more likely that theyre going to be unsafe at work than when they go home
2021835 she knows how to create the perfect party dress with a great gothic touch
2021836 just to update you we had three injuries stanley wilson with an achilles well wait until tomorrow to see how bad it is jason hanson strain on his left thigh and gilbert gardner had a concussion
2021837 not good enough were just going to keep working at it the one thing when you try to run the ball you dont wave a magical wand over it and all of a sudden youre running the ball you have to work at it and call it and punish it and work at it and thats what were going to do
2021838 i cant tell you i have to watch the film we didnt get enough yards
2021839 if we can just no way were backing off of it were going to run it and were going to keep doing it because as you can see it opens up it opens up you get some single coverage on those big guys theyre tough to cover now two positive things that i really like theres going to be a lot of positive after i watch the tape but what i did like no turnovers we went plus one thats winning football and when you do that i think youre in really good shape so if we can keep that part of it going then well be in good shape
2021840 very good and the other thing with that we gave up no sacks and we did a nice job moving the pocket the launch point which constantly changed during the game so its tough if youre on defense to get a beat on where hes at but now the key to everything were still doing is running the ball and digging it in there and fighting our way through that
2021841 without seeing the tape the penalties that jumps out at you which we cant have were not going to do it we had six penalties today and its not winning football we just have to eliminate that i think he cherilus did some good things on his blocking i felt it a couple times i think kevin smith really showed some stuff boy i mean hes boom you get that thing up and think quick so well see off the film a little bit more and jordon as we said from day one hes a great instinct guy we just have to make sure hes going the right way all the time
2021842 like i was saying the other day on some of that thats all we got theres not many our depth is some guys we didnt anticipate playing late in the game
2021843 he showed some of the stuff and hes got awareness and running the ball and boots and running around he threw some nice passes in there today so ill be able to do a better job after i watch the tape and see but off the top of my head i liked him moving the ball down the field and getting in position to win a game for us
2021844 its like pounding the rock you keep swinging if its not breaking and some guys cry about it oh its not going to break its not going to break well were going to break it and you just keep working at it its hard its hard work and we have to stay with it you dont just say hey were going to run the ball here no thats lip service were going to put pad service in
2021845 yeah i feel you can see it with the big receivers in there thats the thing and boy to be able to move the pocket and run the ball and get some play action and predict the coverages for those big guys people are going to have problems covering them
2021846 while there are many women with the variant who are not transsexual and many female to male transsexuals who lack it the finding raises the possibility that the variant makes women more likely to feel that their bodies are of the wrong sex and that this is a result of their brains having been exposed to higher than average levels of sex hormones during development
2021847 the present study found that a mutant gene that ultimately results in higher testosterone levels is overrepresented in female to male transsexualism
2021848 this is in line with what we previously know about masculinisation of the brain and is therefore less likely to be a chance finding
2021849 hence the study is important and adds to the notion that gender identity is influenced by sex hormones early in life and that certain gene combinations make individuals more vulnerable to aberrant effects
2021850 its entirely possible that the attorneys are not giving adequate advice
2021851 an attorney could advise a client that they have a strong defense to enforcement of a contract but that is not the same thing as forecasting what the likely outcome at trial would be
2021852 its peculiar if any field is not improving its performance over a 40 year period
2021853 already illumitoon has acquired some serious titles and is looking forward to launching dvd releases as early as january 2007

2021887 im the real deal and im ready for condit im ready for it so its just a matter of getting condit to agree but the wec definitely wants it to happen its up to condits camp to figure out what it wants id like to fight as often as possible but the way its looking this is the fight i want to wait for i dont want to risk anything like i did before fighting condit the first time i was supposed to fight him when i fought kevin knabjan two months before and i think i peaked too early for that its hard to peak twice in two months so if it comes out that way thats the way im going to have to take it
2021888 condit was able to secure a fight ending armbar midway through the opening round
2021889 the last time i defended my title i didnt approach it the right way

2021904 weve had our strongest spring ever so i expected july to be high but this goes over and above even my wildest readership dreams thanks to everyone who joined us for our tour coverage and we promise to keep on doin our stuff

2021909 interest in his work and his pronouncements fell off and though the russian people celebrated his return in 1994 the severity of his moral judgments about his homeland and about the west caused his influence to wane
2021910 rare public appearances could turn into without offering evidence decreed that solzhenitsyns reputation
2021911 has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society
2021912 if a full fledged america suffered a real defeat from a small communist half country how can the west hope to stand firm in the future
2021913 the communist regime in the east could stand and grow due to the enthusiastic support from an enormous number of western intellectuals who felt a kinship and refused to see communisms crimes
2021914 was a species of treason that the liberal intellectuals of the west were not quite so ready to forgive
2021915 the charge of anti semitism rests almost entirely on negative evidence that is while there is no clear sign of positive hostility toward jews in solzhenitsyns books neither is there much sympathy
2021916 the miraculous birth and consolidation of israel after two thousand years of dispersal is only the most striking of a multitude of examples

2021919 as more and more content is being uploaded to the internet people are putting themselves in the drivers seat instead of waiting for websites to serve up the content
2021920 so paul byrd cleared waivers someone said in the last thread pardon me in advance but ive never understood 100 perfectly how waivers work did the yankees already have an opportunity to pick him up and decided to pass or do they only now have an opportunity now that he has cleared waivers
2021921 did the yankees already have an opportunity to pick him up and decided to pass or do they only now have an opportunity now that he has cleared waivers
2021922 i would think the steinbrenners are going to be popping champagne the minute giambis contract expires i like him and all but his contract may be the worst position player contract in yankee history
2021923 means they could have put a claim on him but didnt since hes cleared waivers hes now tradeable without another team potentially impeding the process
2021924 i would think the steinbrenners are going to be popping champagne the minute giambis contract expires i like him and all but his contract may be the worst position player contract in yankee history
2021925 yeah theyll be thrilled to write that five million dollar check for him not to play for the yankees
2021926 we need to counter the sox lets pick up andru jones off waivers
2021927 wonder if sheets could be obtained on a 4 5 year deal though
2021928 why dont we work on a waiver deal with san diego to get peavy i think considering how bad that team is theyd be willing to listen for the right prospects
2021929 hes great as a catcher but downright average at best as a first base option
2021930 for those of you advocating jorges move to 1st how are we going to get some younger position players involved if we go into next year with jorge at 1st matsui at dh and pudge catching as i see it given the contracts we have the only two spots where we can get younger are at 1st and corner outfielder
2021931 as a yankee 1b giambi at best rates 6th behind these guys
2021932 yeah theyll be thrilled to write that five million dollar check for him not to play for the yankees
2021933 statistics and is amateur practitioners is taking the joy out of baseball
2021934 so what do you guys think jody gerut in cf instead of melky takes away an automatic out right now and adds a clutch hitter w plus defensive range in the of
2021935 people get wedded to statistics in determining what is and is not an acceptable offensive output from a position if a healthy year from your starting nine can produce 950 runs it doesnt matter who starts at what position my friend is an economics statistics genius but when he tells me it makes no sense to draft college relievers i look at guys like robertson melancon jb cox and wonder what the hell hes talking about
2021936 i think that if adam dunn can play 1b he would be a more realistic option especially if the reds dont offer him salary arbitration his perceived value isnt that great since he has low batting averages but his production is great and the yanks can probably get him on a cheaper contract in both years and money than he actually desevres based on his performance
2021937 jorge lives in tampa in the offseason and if he feels less time behind the plate and more time at 1st base is a help to the team and his career tino will tutor him for all the time he needs at early workouts
2021938 phillies just got scott eyre from the cubs for a minor league player
2021939 boston now has an exclusive 48 hour window to work out a deal for giles
2021940 but hes much more athletic than posada and a much better first baseman posada would be a below average defender and make giambi look like the 2nd coming of don mattingly with the glove
2021941 posada would be a below average defender and make giambi look like the 2nd coming of don mattingly with the glove
2021942 melky is ready to play every day hes not exactly where he wants to be or where we want him to be but that doesnt mean melkys not a good player
2021943 i love how pete likes to gloat about what the pats did to favre several years ago mr sensitive teeth is going to make 18 1 secondary look like pee wee leaguers they lost randall gay and asante samuel no one especially pats fans likes to address that also their linebacking crew should all be getting their aarp membership cards in the mail soon
2021944 you better sign manny or the angels will own la
2021945 if the yankees signed dunn next season when hes batting 220 with 150 strikeouts youd be destroying cashman or whoever the gm is for letting giambi walk away
2021946 mark feinsand is reporting that pettitte is going to miss his next start ill see everybody next year
2021947 you are 100 wrong maybe others would jump on cashman but i certainly wouldnt batting average is overrated dunn gets on base quite frequently and is a huge power threat he is an impact force with the bat essentially he is a better healthier younger more powerful version of the giambi from the last couple of years and that is very valuable
2021948 as much as the yanks value mo krod is the second best in the game and they cant be dumb enough to just watch him walk
2021949 get me the catagory of boras clients he wants a big contract and he believes boras will get it for him
2021950 new rotation 1 mussina 2 ponson 3 giese 4 kennedy 5 rasner solid
2021951 no way is that 100 wrong id rather get 15 20 home runs good defense and a good team player at 1b then a one dimensional lug like dunn
2021952 i was able to run and i didnt have any problems after that
2021953 we did something new today so it will be interesting how the knee responds
2021954 if i dont have any problems then i think thats going to be a big step forward
2021955 thats what being an all out machine for three months will do
2021956 andy pettitte likely to miss next start with arm stiffness
2021957 i have to ask who honestly thought that at this point of the season mike mussina would be the last man standing
2021958 closers go to the hof and saves are a big reason why guys arent giving that up to move to a setup role
2021959 the most creative thing people can come up with for austin jackson is
2021960 pettitte is done the team is done the rotation is awful
2021961 i am fine missing a start is news to me
2021962 i feel great no one has ever discussed missing a start with me i am pitching i have not discussed missing a start with anybody
2021963 the issue will likely keep the lefthander from taking the mound on sunday in anaheim
2021964 any chance we can see nady playing center next year with damon matsui platooning in left dh and abreu in right
2021965 when he wakes up he is under the influence of a spell from athena he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them imagining they are the achaean leaders including odysseus and agamemnon when he comes to his senses covered in blood and realizes what he did with diminished honor he decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than to live in shame
2021966 sounds ambiguous to me i bet there was truth in the original article and he is feeling tightness but he plans on pitching through it
2021967 everyone is a liar and everything that members of the yankees organization say arent really what they mean or totally the truth
2021968 if the yankees want to keep abreu next year they will have one outfielder too many if it were up to me id keep abreu in rf keep nady in lf use matsui as the full time dh and move damon to 1b if we dont get tex which is a possibility if we do get tex then id trade damon
2021969 moose was the guy most people connected with the yankees thought would pitch himself out of the mix once the season began there wasnt a lot of belief he had a lot left in the tank now hes not only the last guy standing he has been their best starting pitcher all season amazing
2021970 the brilliant cashman had better find some quality arms for next season to offer fans a reason to pay 1000 per seat a declining andy pettitte methuselah mike mussina deer in the headlights ian kennedy and oft injured phil hughes will not cut it even the aruban aristocrat cant justify those prices
2021971 it only took 100 games for them to sit melky
2021972 melky the plan is to play him tomorrow but girardi said the complexion of the team changed when nady was acquired and he has to put the best lineup he can out there girardi also said damon looks good in cf
2021973 espns chris mortenson is reporting that brett farve deanna farve and jets brass are headed out to ruby tuesdays in downtown cleveland after the press conference nfl live has planned a live remote from outside the restaurant sal paolantinio will give us the inside scoop stay tuned to espn for further developments from this story
2021974 hey how do you watch the video of the scranton game is it indeed free
2021975 im not trying to cause any race issues here but do the yankees scout in inner city neighborhoods maybe theyve started to now perhaps i did see that they drafted that black kid from calif in this years draft and all but isnt their record on drafting and developing african american ballplayers a little dispicable
2021976 well i heard rumors that his injury was fake is it true
2021977 i just figure since the yankees have more money than everyone else they should have more scouts in inner cities maybe they do i honestly do not know
2021978 hughes doesnt throw 95 he is at 92 tops dont buy the gun there
2021979 i really that one of tampa player is injured longgoria
2021980 matt nyy fan in boston august 7th 2008 at 8 10 pm if he threw harder when he was younger than wow hes still only 22 yrs old and hes on the velocity decline already
2021981 al from bk stop trolling youre obviously a red sox fan trying to stir some up go home you loser are you watching him on milb tv right now cuz i am and hes inducing groundball after groundball
2021982 just curious as to why you think it is a
2021983 leave the lectures to some other sites most of us care about the game and hughes and dont really care about why black kids dont play pro baseball
2021984 names we havent seen before telling good posters on here what to write troll seems to be a lot of them in here tonight its that deadly combination of school being out and the red sox being off tonight
2021985 ron wants to be one of max kellermans much maligned interns august 7th 2008 at 8 30 pm hughes pitches 90 95 when healthy sitting around 93 94 with good command and a little movement with his curveball thats plenty good im sure hes thrown 95 97 in the past but in short spurts in any case why bother arguing it
2021986 deric mckamey of baseball hq and he said that past reports on hughes velocity as is often the case with pitching prospects were greatly exaggerated
2021987 enough with the lack of african american players in baseball maybe this disparity is caused by the massive amounts of young black men wanting to play basketball or football instead i saw some statistics that said african americans represented over 80 of the nba and over 65 of the nfl i believe this change has occured because more and more boys growing up in the inner city prefer basketball and football because it is more accessible and more popular that is my honest opinion think of it what you may
2021988 when youre comments take up full pages everyone has to see them send them an email
2021989 it might have something to do with the fact that you can play hoops in a parking lot or football in a small empty plot but need a bit more space to play baseball at least thats how it was where i grew up
2021990 you guys bashing every fan that admits that hughes is not nolan ryan with a better curveball are just making the case that yankee fans are classless idiots i dont think thats the case much of the time but you arent helping hughes can be a no 1 pitcher i firmly believe that
2021991 philip hughes rhp low a charleston yankees technically hes not really a prospect any more but hes still a young unproven player based on what hughes showed on saturday though he could be a factor in the post season race once the top pitching prospect in the game hughes made his second rehab appearance since coming back from a rib injury absolutely dominating sally league hitters on saturday allowing one hit in 3 2 3 shutout innings while striking out five more important was how good hughes stuff was as his fastball sat in the low 90s and consistently touched 94 95 the kind of velocity he showed frequently in the minors but rarely with the yanks while neither he nor ian kennedy have played the expected roles at the big league level this year they both might come september
2021992 the people trolls calling hughes the second coming of brandon backe are the ones being bashed actually i see him as a cole hamels type actually
2021993 i never threw that hard even when i was going good at trenton double a i looked at the reports and it was 93 there were three times all year i touched 95
2021994 it all stems from the command of the fastball you have to make them put the ball in play use two or three pitches
2021995 its early if its august and i am having the same problems i probably wouldnt be here
2021996 i have to pitch well and everything else will take care of itself
2021997 so do we want him to replace big g hes making 4 8m this year
2021998 hank blalock is an average hitter hes been amazingly mediocre over his whole career especially outside of texas i dont want any part of him
2021999 i just checked his numbers basically 2 good years and the other 5 were below avg i guess i just remembered him homering against the yanks a few times
2022000 who cares if he hit it hard he hit it right at michael young young barely moved it was a textbook double play ball a double play is a double play there arent good ones and bad ones because he hit it hard
2022001 who cares if he hit it hard he hit it right at michael young young barely moved it was a textbook double play ball a double play is a double play there arent good ones and bad ones because he hit it hard

2022004 giese vs lackey on sat have you ever seen a matchup that one sided
2022005 chone figgins millar jose guillen aubrey huff jonny gomes alex rios guys i wish could be sent to mars never to return
2022006 a rod is great everyone no one should ever say anything negative about him or his lack of production in the most crucial time of the season who cares if he hits into double plays he is the best player ever and should never get any heat for coming up short in a big spot
2022007 last time it was rasner against lackey guess what we won that game
2022008 laura i though your started a blog i was gonna check it out but i like the go yankees fake url lol
2022009 graziano reports a scout had hughes 94 95 in the first few innings hughes is back baby
2022010 that cant possibly be true because j z didnt see it
2022011 i meant to include you go to the games watch the games on tv to see the players not the umpires
2022012 marlon byrd is 7 of 13 with six runs scored and four rbi in this series
2022013 lol they actually have two runs laura i know its not much better than one but lets not be shortchanging them when theyre so hard to come by at times
2022014 wow he made the toughest out in the majors chase crap
2022015 wow melancon just kd some guy real hard to end the game hes really good
2022016 has arod even hit the ball out of the infield in this series
2022017 im going to go back to sucking against the next team
2022018 whats the hitting coachs job again does it have something to do with the hitters approach to hitting
2022019 btw like i suspected hughes has gone to the 06 mechanics and its showing w topping out once at 96 mph tonight
2022020 feldmans looking cocky but tired jump on the first pitch
2022021 who else watches this on mlb tv the rangers fans are like a circus act painted bodies horse masks superheroes tacky
2022022 they should have every hitter practice bunting every day is there anyone on this team besides damon that can lay down a bunt
2022023 some swiss research lab built a particle collider and plans to show it later some time after a court dismissed a civil lawsuit saying that the device could destroy the world
2022024 texas has eight hits and a walk over six innings and hasnt scored
2022025 in a post george world i guess we need to learn not to expect anything in yankee land
2022026 i dont know laura matsui hits into alot of dps also i think it would be good to not put him in cleanup
2022027 august 7th 2008 at 10 27 pm walking giambi to face nady thanks ron washington
2022028 drive a line drive to the gap hit a home run
2022029 he is lucky these at bats arent at ys he would be booed off the field
2022030 no need to try to be a hero just play
2022031 again another false statement he has looked awful of late he wouldnt have 20 hrs if he looked awful since he returned
2022032 how many of arods home runs have come when the game was within two runs either way
2022033 i mean i know you are new to baseball but theres a reason david eckstein doesnt bat 4th
2022034 ok laura when was the last time we got a key hit from arod i really cant remember
2022035 craig it has nothing to do with his pay scale it has everything to do with our cleanup hitter hitting 220 or so with risp i wouldnt care if he made the league minimum the production he has given from the spot in the batting order is unacceptable
2022036 how many of arods home runs have come when the game was within two runs either way any way to find that out im guessing if he hit 20 home runs that 18 of them had no affect at all on the game
2022037 update 10 37 p m the addition of marte really changes the way girardi can use the bullpen marte seems best suited for situational work at least based on what we have seen so far
2022038 you morons sj44 is at least honest hes not a homer with blinders on youve got to be a fool to not see that this team has problems
2022039 that is the second time that betemit hit the ball to the pitcher you guys want to complain about a rod what about that loser hes wasting a roster spot
2022040 you morons sj44 is at least honest hes not a homer with blinders on youve got to be a fool to not see that this team has problems
2022041 update 10 52 p m another briliant play by jeter by making the final out of the inning after the rbi single he allows mo to get the save what leadership
2022042 every time he slides or does anything hard he gets up slow and looks like he is hurt
2022043 a win is a win at this part of the season they dont have to be pretty they just have to be wins
2022044 in other news i blame cm wang if jeter is really hurt he should have cautioned the captain about the perils of hurting ones foot while running the bases
2022045 a win is a win at this part of the season they dont have to be pretty they just have to be wins
2022046 ken singleton amp david cone are a great tv commentator combo insightful and neither are full of themselves
2022047 hughes no longer throws a slider having scrapped it in favor of a cutter hughes said the slider was a 78 80 mph pitch perhaps too close in velocity to his changeup and the cutter comes in around 88 mph he used it with some effectiveness as a strikeout pitch tonight
2022048 it is impossible to agree with you because you simply disregard the fact that everyone who posts here is 100 aware that sj44 labeled the yankees season as
2022049 cb do you think a cutter is a good idea for phil
2022050 tampa bay at the end of the day on 9 17 will be 81 69 with 8 of their last 12 games including their very last 8 games on the road
2022051 update 10 52 p m another briliant play by jeter by making the final out of the inning after the rbi single he allows mo to get the save what leadership
2022052 did anyone answer what kind of stuff does he have
2022053 sj44 time to get on your meds if a post is going to upset you so much dear
2022054 are the yankees transforming phil coke into a reliever long term
2022055 today marks the 10th anniversary of the al qaeda terrorist attacks on u
2022056 ten years after these devastating attacks america continues its global struggle against terrorists who attack us and our way of life the terrorists dedication to death and destruction will be thwarted by our steadfast commitment to counter the threat they pose with all the instruments at our disposal military intelligence law enforcement diplomacy financial and economic our prayers go out to the families of those who were killed or harmed in the embassy bombings as we reaffirm our commitment to fight the scourge of al qaeda until all of its violent extremists are killed or brought to justice
2022057 cycling is not only good for the environment but it also reduces road congestion and improves health many other councils offer such schemes to their employees as do several firms here in bath the council should be leading on the green travel agenda and cutting the carbon footprint of the area the cycle scheme is a great way of getting more people onto bikes and properly equipped for safe and comfortable commuting to work
2022058 in fact in bath we are lucky to have cyclescheme the countrys leading company in promoting this salary sacrifice idea right here in the city this is a great scheme which i fully support to get employees on their bikes not only will it show that the council values its staff but a fitter healthier workforce will give better value to the council
2022059 getting people out of their cars and onto public transport or cycling and walking should be a high priority when one of the leading companies offering this scheme is based here in bath it amazes me that our council is so far behind the times
2022060 with so many council offices based in bath city centre the council should be taking a lead in promoting sustainable methods of getting to work as well as cutting congestion in the city
2022061 we are currently working with nearly seventy employers based in bath alone and over 80 councils and boroughs within the uk
2022062 our friendly and efficient services are entirely free to the employer and fully compliant with government legislation in fact we run schemes for the department for transport and office of fair trading the two leading protagonists of the cycle to work initiative
2022063 i find it ironic that we provide our free service for every public body in the highlands for instance but bath and north east somerset council have so far managed to miss out on the best government initiative to date
2022064 i said look either you bring me some baseballs or were not doing this anymore for you guys
2022065 weve got a 1 300 budget and were spending it all on baseballs so he can hit for you
2022066 my emotions were bottled up and i didnt deal with things the right way
2022067 i was making immature decisions and running with the wrong crew at times getting into more trouble than i needed
2022068 something finally clicked in my mind and i needed to work on this to become a better person
2022069 i knew eventually it would affect my relationships and my career
2022070 when she was really sick i knew that if i never had a chance to speak with her or see her alive again i wasnt going to let my opportunity go to waste
2022071 you wish you could call up mom or send her that nice gift for me that day is about honoring her whether its hitting a home run or saying a prayer or just looking back on the good times
2022072 like an optical illusion when you see a golf ball almost dip before taking off
2022073 aluminum bat you know its hard to imagine a ball going 600 feet but thats what they said
2022074 wed have games that were getting out of hand and id literally walk over to the opposing coach and say dont let your kid throw an outside fastball like that
2022075 i would say throw it inside or anywhere else but my god please dont throw it outside on the corner and get your kid killed
2022076 hes well beyond his years maturity wise especially as a baseball player
2022077 if something is wrong hes going to figure it out pretty quick
2022078 the way things ended up with all the support it was unbelievable
2022079 to be in a home run derby to go out there and put on a show in front of your home crowd at an all star game it was definitely special
2022080 im still 20 and im going to make mistakes knowing where to draw the line is something ive done well and struggled with
2022081 i think you need to wake up in the morning and be honest with yourself and know what you need to work on accepting the fact i needed help was a big step for me
2022082 the ball was up a little bit today and they took advantage of it theres not a whole lot you can do about it i kinda felt helpless on the mound tonight it happens to everyone so you cant dwell on it you have to throw your hands up and just try to come back better the next start
2022083 i feel real good i was trying to get ahead early in the count and use my fastball a lot when they put me in i was trying to keep the game close because i know we have a good team good hitting so i knew we could come back i think this was one my best performances this year all my pitches were working tonight
2022084 it was my third at bat so id pretty much seen what he could throw he was throwing a lot of off speed stuff wasnt throwing hard i was just looking for something to put a good swing on not for any particular pitch but just a pitch to hit i dont hit a lot of homeruns so sometimes when i hit one i can tell its going this one i had a feeling it was going out
2022085 with our strategic alliance with z corporation we have expanded our solutions portfolio and we are determined to provide maximum value to our customers based on this association we intend to address other high potential segments like medical packaging metal casting consumer goods architecture education amp research
2022086 not many kids anywhere in one season have hit over 30 home runs especially in high school
2022087 he is a big strong athletic type kid this year there are not a lot of power hitting kids to see
2022088 im excited about it like vistas coach todd larson said ive got a win win situation
2022089 if i dont go where i want in the draft ill be at kansas if i get drafted and things fall my way then ill have the opportunity to play pro baseball
2022090 well let me refer to my 15 page wedding packet

2022096 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness one letter was quoted as saying
2022097 clearly the archbishop is in a conflicted situation while holding these personal convictions with the job of the archbishop of canterbury to uphold the teaching of the church
2022098 have led him to do nothing to bring any discipline in the church on this matter
2022099 one cannot help but wonder whether his personal views affect the ways in which he tries to resolve difficulties instead of leading the church out of this crisis we feel the archbishop of canterbury is prolonging it because of his personal unhappiness about disciplining a section of the church with which he personally agrees
2022100 i would walk 500 miles and i would walk 500 more
2022101 as a young adult i would like to be able to marry the person i choose one day but i need the same rights and protections as previous generations of arizonans in order to do that
2022102 walking 96 miles may seem like a crazy feat but the purpose is to be bold the length is meant to be challenging
2022103 it has been challenging for gay and lesbian arizonans to go 96 years without equal rights walking symbolizes a journey and a destination because its time to end these divisive and pointless ballot measures
2022104 24 7 first rate service which guaranteed ten cents per minute for calls within canada and twenty cents for calls to the us and thirty cents using the card away from home
2022105 also presented certain challenges for telus that were less than satisfactory
2022106 that can be attributed to the competitive voice pricing we are facing in the canadian market which is offsetting our strong 54 per cent growth in wireless data
2022107 despite the fact that since 2001 teluss ongoing investment in restructuring and workforce reduction totals 1 billion i am less than satisfied with the revision of our restructuring expense target from 50 million to 30 million
2022108 clearly we need to realize improved traction on our efficiency initiatives
2022109 this is key if we are to absorb the endemic challenges of the telecom industry including price commoditization new competition and dilution from new technologies
2022110 as a result of good operational execution year to date we have made upward revisions to full year 2008 revenue guidance as well as narrowing the ranges for ebitda and eps guidance while maintaining existing guidance for non spectrum capital expenditures

2022158 there is a need more pressing by the day to question the value of the economic political and personal liberty that has been won
2022159 its thanks to ideology that it fell to the 20th century to experience villainy on a scale of millions
2022160 i am inclined to think that the reason is that they give expression to a deep felt dissatisfaction with a world which does not and cannot live up to our moral ideals and to our dreams of perfection

2022167 inevitably one day some commissioner will suggest that their work would be more effectively done were they to concentrate on the root cause of the issue the total number of people on the planet
2022168 and with such a move the earth commission for thermostatic control will have transformed itself into an orwellian style world government with its own currency army and control over every person and every inch of our planet
2022169 as horrific as such an outcome is if we delay action to combat the climate crisis the carbon dictatorship may become essential for our survival

2022175 its no secret that i really dont like road courses
2022176 watkins glen is a little faster and flatter than infineon raceway but i grew up watching racing on ovals and not road courses ive had a good run or two at the glen and im running the nationwide race there to get some extra seat time but i just generally dont like road course racing we just want to run well get through it and get on with oval track racing at michigan
2022177 running the nationwide car is really the best way to get acclimated with the track and get back up to speed
2022178 when you just run the cup car all weekend like we do at sonoma you spend the first day just learning the track again at least i do
2022179 i would be able to go in there and get a couple hours on the race track before i got in my cup car i thought maybe i could help my cup guys by running better laps and getting better feedback to them for the car it should be fun i have a pretty good memory of winning there against ron fellows in 98 that really meant a lot to me to beat him there i really respect him as a road racer

2022192 government troops were forced to launch measures for the establishment of peace in the region after separatist forces responded to president saakashvilis peace initiatives by shelling georgian villages
2022193 government forces are now undertaking measures to secure the restoration and establishment of a guaranteed peaceful situation wherein there will be no longer a threat to the population of that region
2022194 these measures are ongoing now and will continue until we reach this goal
2022195 we are also undertaking measures to prevent further massive infiltration of those volunteers because they are one of the major sources of destabilization
2022196 for those of us who have been engaged with plos from its conception the launch of plos one is tremendously exciting this is the moment when we seize the full potential of the internet to make communication of research findings an interactive and fully accessible process that gives greater value to what we do as scientists

2022200 we showed that wound healing triggered an embryonic state in the skin which made it receptive to receiving instructions from wnt proteins
2022201 the wnts are a network of proteins implicated in hair follicle development
2022202 weve found that we can influence wound healing with wnts or other proteins that allow the skin to heal in a way that has less scarring and includes all the normal structures of the skin such as hair follicles and oil glands rather than just a scar
2022203 scientists succeed in hair follicle regeneration in an animal model
2022204 we know that animals can recognize quantities but there is less evidence for their ability to carry out explicit mathematical tasks such as addition
2022205 if the correct sum was 11 and the box with the incorrect number held 12 dots both monkeys and the college students took longer to answer and had more errors we call this the ratio effect
2022206 whats remarkable is that both species suffered from the ratio effect at virtually the same rate
2022207 much of adult humans mathematical capacity lies in their ability to represent numerical concepts using symbolic language a monkey cant tell the difference between 2000 and 2001 objects for instance however our work has shown that both humans and monkeys can mentally manipulate representations of number to generate approximate sums of individual objects
2022208 we believed that if we could understand how cells develop and become photoreceptors or any other specific neuron our transplantation efforts would meet with greater success this technique gives us new insights in repairing damage to the retina and possibly other parts of the central nervous system
2022209 is that there is a window of opportunity during which a cell has committed itself to becoming a rod but has not yet started to function as such
2022210 this provides a clear example of how basic fundamental research can contribute to treatment of blinding diseases
2022211 we now have proof of principle that our approach to repairing damaged retina by transplantation of appropriate cells can be successful
2022212 perhaps within the next five years we will begin to see the first steps toward retinal cell transplants for people with blinding eye disease
2022213 sickle cell disease can only be cured by transplanting healthy blood forming stem cells from another individual but this option is not available to most patients due to the difficulty in finding a compatible donor
2022214 by using gene transfer there is always a donor match because the patients own stem cells are used to treat the disease
2022215 an innovative and sophisticated approach was needed to genetically engineer hematopoietic stem cells using a practical and clinically applicable process the transferred gene must not disrupt the cells normal functions
2022216 this proved our hypothesis that you can simultaneously add one function and delete another in the same cell and obtain synergistic genetic modifications within a single cell
2022217 in this case we used the technique to correct sickle cell disease but it should be broadly applicable to use therapeutically in stem cells or malignant cells
2022218 sickle cell disease corrected in human models using stem cell based gene therapy
2022219 problem solving whether creative or methodical doesnt begin from scratch when a person starts to work on a problem his or her pre existing brain state biases a person to use a creative or a methodical strategy

2022226 leak proof way of potentially delivering cells and drugs to a wound or diseased organ
2022227 it has the ability to regenerate itself quite easily if almost 70 percent of it is lost to disease and removed that remaining 30 percent can grow back affording a functional liver we want to use the hydrogels to deliver hepatocytes to the liver
2022228 these could be used to beef up the livers function prior to surgery if for example someone had hepatitis or drank a lot factors that would normally limit the amount of cancerous liver that can be removed
2022229 the thing is he used to throw these things away
2022230 for the research i was working on when i was a graduate student a long time ago the last thing i wanted to make was hydrogels
2022231 so when thats what i ended up with id throw them out
2022232 a whole host of terrific students and other people on and off campus have helped this come to fruition
2022233 without these students and collaborators this work would be impossible
2022234 our technology is completely different from whats available now this could be the foundation for the future of endoscopy

2022238 if i know your sect i anticipate your argument i hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church do i not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word do i not know that with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution he will do no such thing do i not know that he is pledged to himself not to look at but one side the permitted side not as a man but as a parish minister he is a retained attorney and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation

2022245 with improvements in genome technology weve found that human cancer is noisy
2022246 there are lots of alterations only some of which causally contribute to the disease
2022247 genetically engineered mice by definition develop more defined cancers than humans
2022248 mice can therefore be used as a filter to help reduce that noise and as a tool to determine in areas of chromosomal alteration what changes are functionally relevant
2022249 there has to be a way to prioritize the effort
2022250 if you are seeing the same event in different species it becomes more likely that a common biological pressure is responsible more likely that it is an important event
2022251 any prognostic significance would require rigorous investigation and validation in appropriately designed prospective clinical trials
2022252 how specific lesions interact to produce its aggressive characteristics remains poorly understood
2022253 robust stringent and biologically relevant systems for filtering annotating and prioritizing the efforts of cancer geneticists and biologists will be essential to facilitate and accelerate the translation of our genomic knowledge into cancer drugs that will impact patient survival

2022263 we launched several jones brand building programs including campaign cola which generated more than 2 5m in media value and drove awareness of our new jones pure cane sugar cola product
2022264 while we are pleased with progress on many fronts we increased promotion allowances and slotting fees in order to support the new can presence and bolster the bottle business this had a negative impact on our net sales and profitability we believe these key expenditures will result in greater awareness of our beverages and a stronger market position for our company

2022289 lottery director john musgrave made sure to dot every i and cross every t as we got ready for table gambling which ensured a smooth process
2022290 the table gambling has done everything we expected it to do
2022291 i think table gambling has exceeded any expectations we could have had it has added another element for us that has allowed us to attract many new customers
2022292 our slots are down approximately 16 5 million from last year primarily due to the impact from the meadows
2022293 while our table games have contributed approximately 16 5 million with poker adding 3 4 million when you consider the extra labor costs associated with operating table games and our table games marketing expenses wheeling island is actually trending approximately 3 million behind last year
2022294 table games while positively contributing to the business have not offset the lost business from pennsylvania slot free play initiatives
2022295 because of the money we have received from table gambling the governor has been able to use some other money to pay down various debts in the state
2022296 financially and economically table gambling has been very good to the state
2022297 it is really good to see that so many people have been able to get jobs at the tracks
2022298 many states are looking to pay off debts without raising taxes
2022299 if these other states take some of our business we will just have to adapt
2022300 if pennsylvania picks up tables and ohio gets gambling we would be in trouble we knew we would take a hit once pennsylvania started with slots so it would be the same thing if they got tables
2022301 i just dont see gambling as a growing industry here anymore
2022302 we at the state are working to diversify our economy as much as possible with jobs focusing on energy and industry

2022309 the interest in climate change tax relief suggests tax directors are looking at the impact of australias proposed emissions trading system emission reduction targets and high energy costs on their business
2022310 if the government wants business to get involved in research and development or climate change then they need to gear the tax system to provide some incentive
2022311 if we maintain the corporate tax rate where it is we would like to see some accelerated depreciation brought back in
2022312 ingmar bergmans films have moved inspired and influenced a host of filmmakers and audiences across the world it is no wonder that he is often called the greatest cinematic artist ever it is only just that the nation that makes the largest quantity of films in the world each year should also get the best quality films from across the world on the first death anniversary of bergman this festival and box set is this nations tribute to the great master
2022313 bergman is easily one of the best known swedes in the world and it is very heartening for me to be a part of the process to make sure that his work is accessible to his fans and film enthusiasts in india
2022314 what makes this retrospective even more special for me is the fact that we are all gathered to pay tribute to mr bergman the man who has not just defined swedish cinema for the world but has contributed to shaping cinema as the world knows it too
2022315 im happy to have had the opportunity to share some time with him he might be gone now but his passion for the possibilities and challenges of filmmaking will be inspiring for ever in fact i once asked mr bergman dont you ever tire of watching all these films he laughed and said filmmaking is an expanding universe the more you look the more you find
2022316 bergman stormed into the world cinema scene with two masterpieces in the same year 1957 such was the genius of this prolific director without whose name no discussion of cinema would ever be complete it hurt us to know that masterpieces made by him and other great directors had never been available in this country to the masses with this festival i personally feel a sense of satisfaction about the number of people it is reaching out to across the country when quality cinema as embodied by bergman is widely seen and appreciated quality cinema would end up being made as well

2022326 how to be a communist company in a free market society
2022327 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2022328 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2022329 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2022330 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2022331 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2022332 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2022333 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2022334 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2022335 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states

2022347 as people of faith we believe that it is immoral to ignore our nations most vulnerable populations
2022348 we believe enduring poverty undermines our countrys economic strength and prosperity every day faith organizations serve individuals in need within our communities but our efforts to sustain our brothers and sisters living in poverty must be complemented with a serious plan from our political leaders to reduce the number of needy
2022349 over the past several years denominations such as abc which have long advocated for the poor as an essential expression of the christian faith have been joined by more and more christian bodies and agencies who have come to the same conclusion we rejoice in this growing consensus within the christian community and our common action to speak with other faith communities in this declaration that concern for the poor is a core value for us in matters of governance
2022350 by making a commitment to help the least of us

2022365 in the last historical battle it was to wage anarchism was to see all the ideological sauce that comprised its being fall back into its face state freedom individual and other musty ingredients with capital letters while the libertarian militias workers and peasants were saving its honor making the greatest practical contribution ever to the international proletarian movement burning churches fighting on all fronts against the bourgeoisie fascism and stalinism and beginning to create a truly communist society
2022366 for franco to be defeated first companys and caballero had to be defeated for fascism to be wiped out first the bourgeoisie and its stalinist and socialist allies had to be crushed the capitalist state had to be destroyed from top to bottom and workers power based on rank and file committees be installed antifascist unity has just been submission to the bourgeoisie

2022446 the failure of a small californian mortgage lender yesterday increased nervousness in the credit derivatives market about the large number of us
2022447 there is suffering in the world and god is supposed to be all powerful and god is supposed to be good so how can he exist
2022448 some girls seemed more upset when they werent pregnant than when they were
2022449 we found out one of the fathers is a 24 year old homeless guy
2022450 all that soil out there are plants that grew 6 000 years ago and didnt decompose completely
2022451 thats what peat is so were just making the same thing happen that happened here for millennia
2022452 we were capturing a lot of carbon dioxide at levels much greater than other systems marshes and forests grasslands
2022453 they can just sit back and watch the tules grow and they should be making money
2022454 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
2022455 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow
2022456 they will use sulfate iron or some other compound instead of producing carbon dioxide at the end of the pathway they end up producing methane
2022457 we cant drill our way out of this oil shortage
2022458 do as ah say not as ah do for verily ah am wiser than thee
2022459 whats special to me is to see the festival is still here to see the people all the wonderful volunteers

2022464 reconciliation of the equal importance of all things imaginary and real
2022465 reflecting on her release from captivity former french colombian hostage ingrid betancourt says that jesus kept his promise to her when she was released in june after she consecrated herself to the sacred heart
2022466 why because without him at my side i would never have managed to survive the pain
2022467 being a hostage places you in a situation of constant humiliation faced with this you can take one of two possible paths either you allow yourself to become ugly and bitter filled with hate and vindictiveness or you follow the other path that is shown by jesus
2022468 he jesus said bless your enemies each time i read the bible i felt those words were directed at me as though jesus were standing in front of me he knew what to say to me
2022469 of course i realised that when your enemy is awful it is hard to live out those words faithfully and therefore i felt like saying the exact opposite when i said these words however it was like magic i felt a kind of relief
2022470 the hatred simply vanished i feel that a transformation took place within me and i owe that change to being able to listen to what god wanted for me
2022471 at the start of my captivity i said to myself you are going to be here for months and months so you might as well read the bible which i had not done previously
2022472 opening it it fell open on the epistles of st paul on the passage which i can recite more or less from memory you may ask for what you will but the holy spirit will ask better as he knows what you truly need
2022473 when i read that i exclaimed my god i know what i want to be free
2022474 later i understood that i had to thank god for taking him because my father would never have been able to endure those six years of suffering
2022475 i was listening to radio maria the international catholic radio station and i discovered that june is the month dedicated to the sacred heart
2022476 i do not know exactly what it means to consecrate oneself to the sacred heart but if you tell me during the month of june i will be all yours
2022477 the goal of the peregrine release is to bring back native species to this area
2022478 we hope that rocky or perhaps garnet a male released two years ago at rock city will return to continue the peregrine breeding in this area
2022479 yo bro dat end table is sick you should totally get it

2022485 a fanatic is one who cant change his mind and wont change the subject
2022486 these things happen more frequently towards the border instead of this far north but we have seen more recently theres no doubt about it
2022487 the goal was to bleed the family of every penny they could get and then either set the victims free or kill them

2022489 a rome based body called the international federation for the protection of rights and freedom or federsex for short
2022490 fast and easy money but they are so on the edge of not maintaining their current demand its a disaster in the making
2022491 the united states of america and the kosovo liberation army stand for the same values and principles
2022492 why are no blogs being written about the new elton john album
2022493 the new mellencamp album man you need to hear it its awesome its tot
2022494 the national weather service issued a watch which means we all have to be very very careful about not lighting any fires right now
2022495 over the past year with injuries ive hit bit of a brick wall so i think this is an ideal place to get back on track and get where i want to be personally and as part of the team as well
2022496 the place is lovely but to be honest ive come for a football point of view
2022497 football comes first and i see this as a great move for my career
2022498 obviously the area is nice and it will hopefully be somewhere i can settle in but as i said the football came first
2022499 it was something i felt i had to do and im glad to be here now
2022500 i played here five times and i know that players dont really want to come here because its very difficult
2022501 its also been hostile to say the least at times which is a good thing if youre on the home team
2022502 its a fresh start for me and i want to make the best start possible
2022503 itll be a tough game but there are tough games in this league
2022504 i think that its even harder this year in terms of picking out two teams that are going to finish near the top
2022505 its very hard league to predict and anyone is in with a chance at both ends
2022506 as ive said before i think a football team is a jigsaw puzzle and i think that when certain pieces come up its important that you try and grab them
2022507 weve been looking in the market for this kind of midfield player and his age is of great benefit as well
2022508 hes got a range of passes hes good in the air and hes got all that a sitting midfielder needs
2022509 the laddy has been shunted from pillar to post and its important to bed him down to a 40 plus season and then well get fantastic service of him
2022510 he has all the pedigree to kick on and if he listens which im sure he will hes got the chance to be a fantastic player and have a fantastic career
2022511 hell be included on saturday and hes going to play unless he falls over
2022512 weve got thursday and friday to put a bit of shape to him tell him what were looking for and then the baptism of fire turns ups so hell hopefully swim rather than sink
2022513 if you remember what i said stevie adams bought to this football team i think weve got the same ilk
2022514 i was actually talking to stevie last night and i said that weve actually got a better player than him plymouth
2022515 im hoping i can play against barnsley even if i blast 75 or 80 minutes
2022516 its a long season and everyone will be getting used to the tempo for the first two or three games anyway i want to perform consistently as i did in the last season before i left
2022517 im happy to be back i didnt want to go to any other club but qpr and in my eyes im here now for the next three years
2022518 when i came back with charlton at the end of last season my dad and grandad were up in the stand and had tears in their eyes at the reception i got
2022519 it was emotional hearing 17 000 people chanting your name ive got a special relationship with the fans and i want to entertain them again this year
2022520 it was pretty much a write off season for me and it was always going to be difficult to go back and try and break into the team
2022521 he hodgson had got his own players in and i wasnt going to be given a chance i was getting vibes from the management that i wasnt in their plans
2022522 i was saying to my agent if things dont happen at fulham theres only one place i want to go i dont want to go to any team in this league other than qpr
2022523 cookie will add something different to our game and dans the same what ive seen already on the training ground excites me
2022524 youve got to believe it otherwise it wont happen even before i used to think it but now that dream is closer with the money the owners are pumping in and what theyve done to the ground
2022525 this team is made for the premier league they deserve another crack at the big time hopefully ill be a part of it because thatd be the ultimate dream kiburn times
2022526 if you disrespect the lower leagues you get punched in the nose
2022527 wed never underestimate any team and well treat swindon with the utmost respect
2022528 ive got a lot of faith in my squad ive made changes in cup games before but it wont be root and branch change my view is we want to go to swindon and win and well go there with a strong team
2022529 its unfortunate that were missing them but well have to cope with that
2022530 im a great lover of akos ive seen martins qualities and i like vineys spikiness he cant wait to get back
2022531 with the 90 minutes up ainsworth hooked cooks left wing cross back into the danger zone and baidoo was there to score from a yard
2022532 a key thing was converting our oil based boilers to gas fired boilers
2022533 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
2022534 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
2022535 leaves for another day the question of how and to whom the award should be distributed
2022536 perhaps it is not too much to hope that the announcement in this memorandum of a hard number will give rise to some off line conversation between the parties in the meantime
2022537 it seems like the resting phase isnt as necessary as was once thought
2022538 even though these stem cells are highly proliferative they still maintain their stem cell character
2022539 if we could use a local and more specific inhibitor of nfatc1 than cyclosporine a to stimulate these stem cells which are just sitting there during an extended resting phase we might be able to promote new hair growth
2022540 in a sense by blocking nfatc1 activity in our older mice their hair follicles were brought back to what appeared to be a more youthful state
2022541 this is the first case where we have been able to activate the hair cycle without accompanying signs of tumorigenesis
2022542 if we can control the activation process of follicle stem cells without promoting tumorigenesis then this would be a big move in the right direction
2022543 protein that controls hair growth also keeps stem cells slumbering
2022544 if you think theres a person under that movable type youre right
2022545 i happen to believe that aafd accredited contracts are an important tool to help us rebalance the franchising industry and i happen to believe that if we lose accredited contracts or back away it will be a terrific disservice to the franchise community
2022546 when this call is over i am hopeful that the cuppys franchisees that are on the call will seize their opportunity to contact us so we can help them organize into an effective organization thats able to achieve real solutions to the problems they are facing
2022547 i do want to make a statement to you about the aafds investigation of cuppys compliance and criteria to retain aafds accredited contract status this has been an investigation that was launched by public scrutiny and information that came to us through various internet blogs including blue maumau with who we have collaboration and communication the bloggers have been free in both their praise and criticism of the efforts of the aafd but this issue began with allegations that the second management group of cuppys coffee more of the morgan management group had made contractual commitments to owners basically in a contract with the lead manufacturing that there was a rider refund if a franchisee was ultimately turned down for financing the allegations on the internet were that many people had been denied those refund claims
2022548 we determined that all but four of them had been resolved in a period of six months of the remaining four the company had committed that those were in dispute and under morg morgans management that those matters would be mediated through the aafd they also committed that they would subsidize the efforts of the franchisees forming an independent owners association
2022549 when dale nabors took over the company there were statements that those commitments would still be honored but they have not followed through
2022550 when he brought mediation to nabors he and the company ignored the engagement of that mediation
2022551 we screwed up we meant well but in launching a new program that was not sufficiently thought out we got used we were unwitting accomplices and have taken serious steps to prevent this from ever happening again
2022552 spin the aafds actions in regards to cuppys as anything but way too little way too late
2022553 the big print giveth and the fine print taketh away
2022554 we are disappointed but we understand celgenes decision given their recent withdrawal of the marketing authorization application for satraplatin in europe we plan to decide in the near future the next steps regarding the development of satraplatin and we will continue to focus our other efforts on advancing our rgb 286638 kinase inhibitor into the clinic and exploring various merger and acquisition opportunities
2022555 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
2022556 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
2022557 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
2022558 desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
2022559 once i started to get a hang of racing on a road course i actually started to like it

2022571 the iq platform virtually works as a self funding system
2022572 interactive marketing is a fragmented discipline in which marketers work with many different vendors to develop and execute marketing programs but as the number of channels and programs grow this situation becomes untenable the primary building block of the online marketing suite is a shared data repository that resides in the central hub and is capable of creating a singular view of the customer and transparently managing responses across interactive channels visual iq then named connexion a is the one of first developers of the unified data model that enables that singular view

2022604 we continue to focus on our three principal objectives for 2008 namely concentrating our resources on our high priority oncology programs conserving cash by funding only essential program activities and focusing on partnering our promising aurora angiogenesis kinase inhibitor the advancement of enmd 2076 into clinical development represents a significant accomplishment as this program was in preclinical discovery when acquired in january 2006 all of entremeds programs are currently in clinical development such that we have multiple opportunities for both internal development and partnering consistent with our previous guidance we anticipate achieving the balance of our 2008 milestones and remaining on or below our expense budget for the second half of 2008

2022649 we have made tremendous progress throughout rcoh and were working hard to make our cma deadline
2022650 it has and will take a lot of work but we are committed to meeting our goals

2022652 with all of the jobs were responsible for the fact that we have kept everything so organized is really amazing
2022653 we have all these jobs in and out of our system in a very timely and efficient manner

2022666 our performance has been very positive in the face of a deteriorating market
2022667 while we were not surprised by the negative turn in the market the erosion was much more significant than anyone envisioned earlier in the year it is evident that the market turmoil is not restricted to housing or commercial construction but has spilled over into the larger economy in light of the weakening credit conditions and the lack of confidence in the financial sector in spite of these headwinds and the slower pace of acquisitions in the first half of the year our core operating strengths strong sales focus and cost containment practices continue to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders the best evidence of this is found in our strong gross margin performance
2022668 commercial construction and non aec accounts continue to provide a solid base of business in spite of the general economic softness and we continue to acquire market share through selective acquisitions and an aggressive sales stance
2022669 by managing our costs and working capital closely the company continues to generate strong cash flow from operations our year to date cash from operating activities is 61 5 million compared to 45 4 million for the same period in 2007
2022670 earlier this year when we provided our sales and earnings guidance our projection of revenue deterioration was primarily related to residential construction since then the financial markets have weakened significantly causing a slowdown in private investment a key driver of non residential construction this slowdown combined with uncertain economic conditions is triggering project delays and cancellations in spite of these adversities we still believe the companys sales and earnings will be within the original annual range we projected due to our position in the market place and our operating strength
2022671 thus we are reaffirming our guidance for 2008 and expect revenues to be in the range of 720 million to 760 million and that earnings per share will be in the range of 1 52 to 1 60 on a fully diluted basis
2022672 i was too redneck id get in too many fights
2022673 his parents and my parents spent three of those years trying to get us together
2022674 one day his dad called me and said what are you doing
2022675 ive got to go because im talking about a lot of things
2022676 so are we going to do this deal or what
2022677 i need to know whether to buy you a hard card
2022678 you wouldve never thought he wanted to be there we never dreamed he would get mad
2022679 after my dad passed everything that he said in the past it was just fogged in there the fog passed and it was like ah ok
2022680 id give anything to sit there and tell him remember the stuff you were telling me about and i was calling you an idiot over i wish i could tell him that but i think he knew
2022681 one day im not going to be there and its going to go off in your head
2022682 he said i want to spend time with you but i dont want you to see me that last part of my life
2022683 i said well youre screwed on that pal because ive got to be down there i cant picture myself missing a minute of those last minutes thats when you think of everything in the world to tell him
2022684 i was running 75 80 mph down the interstate and it seemed like i was running 55 mph
2022685 i got here and i missed it by seven or eight minutes
2022686 that was about the end of it five minutes later
2022687 its funny i tell people he still got me its amazing how they just know
2022688 before wed say bobby we need you to go over here and do this and hed give you that look
2022689 hed go do it now he doesnt give you that look hell just go
2022690 so he looks at it like does that mean at 40 its going to hit me
2022691 he looks at that sometimes and tries to live every day to the fullest even more so than what he used to
2022692 we must not be doing too bad we havent killed each other yet
2022693 though i am but a layman 55 the mussleman youthes hath smyte me so 56 whan on streets i saunter wyth my beau
2022694 i am as toolrant as anye oothere guy 59 but if mussleman law sayes no packynge fudge 60 really nowe who are we to judge
2022695 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2022696 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2022697 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2022698 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here
2022699 other signs that these women carried during the public march included one that read vagina 100 organic
2022700 the great thing with musikfest is it evolves with the music theres a lot of music we perform here that wasnt didnt exist in 1984 and 25 years from now there will be a lot of different music that isnt performed now
2022701 we are talking about how american music in particular has evolved even in the 25 years since musikfest has been in existence
2022702 when the steel stacks open up this festival will stay at its present location with the exception of our main stage riverplace which will move to the south side
2022703 jta jacksonville transit authority tells us when they removed jordan from the restroom the 22 year old became beligerent and they had to call in jso jacksonville sheriffs office
2022704 because of the commotion and the scene that he made they issued him a trespass warning warning him not to come back on that property because of the scene that he was making but as a result of that he was told never to come back to use either bathroom
2022705 a freak a weirdo and the ugliest woman in the world
2022706 we have consistently called for justice and security to be pursued within a framework of strict adherence to international law however the us government has systematically failed in this regard
2022707 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
2022708 the olympic truce captures the spirit of the olympics around the games the world should come together to work for peace and speak out against conflict
2022709 i still remained convinced of the great role the olympics can play as a force for promoting peace around the world including the still raging crisis in darfur yet despite the fact that ive always spoken positively of the olympic ideal and never called for a boycott or asked an athlete to break an ioc rule my visa was revoked less than 24 hours before my scheduled departure
2022710 in the coming days president bush will arrive in beijing i call on president bush to secure the entry of joey cheek and other u s citizens who have been barred from attending the olympics because of their beliefs advocacy for the people of darfur and human rights in china and tibet it is essential that president bush show leadership in promoting democracy freedom and human rights during his visit to china the olympic charter states that any form of discrimination with regard to a country of a person on the grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement the international olympic committee is tolerating clear violations of both the olympic ideals and the commitments the chinese government made in order to host the olympic games
2022711 we were disturbed to learn that the chinese had refused his visa we are taking the matter very seriously we have sent in our embassy in beijing to d marche the chinese that is where we go in and we say we are concerned about this and we want you to reconsider your actions so we would hope that they would change their mind and ill hopefully have more for you later but we had to also wait for washington to wake up to take any further action
2022712 theres no question that beijing has proven that they are capable of anything its astonishing
2022713 ive been to beijing six times and seen six different cities and its all been in three years you come down the street and the trees that theyve planted arent six feet high theyre 60 feet high just coming in from the airport this time we were asking is this the road we came in on last time last time was only four months ago
2022714 when youre trying to do this you always want to be judged on the big picture and not have it broken down into small pockets its real easy to look at something and say yeah this is good but what about that
2022715 theyve certainly demonstrated by any fair standard that human beings are capable of amazing things
2022716 so i hope that what happens out of this is that they are given the benefit of a fair test and that people really judge this for the execution of the event and the sport
2022717 and you want it to be good for them on the street you feel the sense that people are really hoping for a great proud couple of weeks and i hope they get it
2022718 theyve really thought it out every little detail and i really think that anyone who tried to replicate it theres no percentage in it this is the best that theres ever been
2022719 were in a city right now where the best men and women of all time have assembled these are the best athletes that have ever been born and they couldnt have built a more magnificent backdrop for them
2022720 i just sort of feel a spirit of wonder because youre never going to see something like this again there will be great olympics but it wont be like this i think it will be fantastic to be able to look back and say i was here
2022721 i have no idea what people are going to feel at the opening ceremony on friday night but i bet therell be people reaching for words to describe it
2022722 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
2022723 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
2022724 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
2022725 we need to ensure that our friends from the five continents can further enhance their mutual understanding and deepen their friendship during the games
2022726 since beijing won the bid for the games on july 13 2001 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community
2022727 that the olympic games will be held in china a country that accounts for one fifth of humanity shows the trust placed on china by the world and is itself a contribution by china to the world
2022728 the beijing olympic games belongs to the chinese people and more importantly also belongs to the people from around the world
2022729 we pay close attention to raising the level of our people in terms of civility we have launched a nationwide campaign among 400 million chinese children and teenagers concerning the olympic education
2022730 we work vigorously to encourage the chinese people to be gracious courteous warm friendly and hospitable hosts for the games
2022731 until then ill gnash my teeth every time i review a windows mobile device that freezes up crashes sputters out requires seven button presses to do what one could or otherwise forces me to stop what im doing in order to figure out how to get it to do what i want it to do todays mismatch of bloated os code and way too many dialog boxes running on brand new handsets with four year old cpus just doesnt cut it anymore
2022732 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
2022733 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
2022734 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
2022735 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
2022736 no doubt we were taking some sort of abuse at the time and decided right there that we needed a union of course it was all in fun we leveraged the whole carry the broom bag sweeping no respect thing
2022737 murphy and i still curl together although we are on the back end now
2022738 of course we managed to stay members of the union through a founders union contract loophole
2022739 it is unfortunate but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
2022740 hes ours and hes to be lauded for his efforts
2022741 lbj oh he is definitely 900 percent certain coming to the knicks or the nets in 2010 cleveland its nothing personal your city just cant hold a living god thats new yorks job hey we still love that rock hall that has a lot of good stuff like jim morrisons toothpicks or whatever and we think drew carey is awesome you guys from cleveland worship him or something right and hey that brady sizemore is one heck of a tight end so you still have something to root for see
2022742 estaremos fortes mesmo a partir do momento que estivermos unidos

2022744 how insane must it have it been to build this bitch brick by brick
2022745 the presence of too many foreigners gathered outside could create problems
2022746 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating
2022747 it is highly plausible that some low level cops have issued such instructions especially with the current state of high alert in beijing making officials and government agencies paranoid and very nervous about foreigners
2022748 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers
2022749 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

2022755 we can make another tower okay but this time well do it all in one color here watch me
2022756 some sides are white and some are blue i made my tower so its all blue
2022757 maybe this is a good time to ask you some questions

2022766 we are pleased to have richard join somaxon as we plan for the potential commercialization of our product candidate silenor for the treatment of insomnia and the continued development of our business
2022767 i am pleased to join somaxon at this important time in its development as a company
2022768 i look forward to leading the somaxon management team in seeking to enhance stockholder value through the potential launch of silenor and the growth of a sustainable commercial pharmaceutical business
2022769 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
2022770 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realize a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
2022771 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
2022772 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
2022773 no other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that i produced through that we begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of britain because it becomes impossible to defend
2022774 theres no choice here between adaptation and mitigation we have to do both
2022775 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
2022776 i think that is a dangerous mindset to be in thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost
2022777 there is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming it is actually pretty alarming
2022778 this would allow coal fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously thus demonstrating real leadership without this technology we have a real problem
2022779 this offsetting effect which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide will largely disappear if china and india follow the lead of the u s and europe in limiting sulphur emissions the cause of acid deposition

2022798 i heard about you and devin hanson the other night
2022799 dont you think if i was sleeping with him id look like i was sleeping with him
2022800 because i was saving your ass from the wicked witch of the sixth floor
2022801 all you need to know is that im not sleeping with you
2022802 as long as thats clear then i dont think well have a problem
2022803 maybe we could come up with a workable situation for both of us i doubt devin knows how to take care of your needs the way i do you deserve more than some pointless rebound relationship based on nothing but sex
2022804 would you give me everything i ever wanted in a lover
2022805 youll be my rebound and ill be your what you dont need me to tell rita to go to hell
2022806 youll get me past the wicked witch and in to see the wizard if i cant get this business off the ground by the new year thats my problem
2022807 we both know i can give you what you need
2022808 for the next month or so youd have to be the lover you werent when we were together attentive exciting and passionate outside the bedroom youd have to take me out and make me feel like the most beautiful woman in the world satisfy my every desire which is to be wanted by the way not had its to be talked to openly honestly in return ill play your adoring fianc e until you can get rita to leave you alone or the year plays out

2022817 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new

2022827 i dont understand the point of it given the fact that she is no longer there
2022828 it is my understanding that this book like other university publications was intended to support our marketing initiatives by informing various constituencies of our accomplishments
2022829 if it was to market the university they should have marketed the university not one individual they just dont get it
2022830 it gets to the point where you shrug your shoulders and say what do you expect
2022831 if we get 10k i will make it happen i appreciate your attempt to get more i dont want a public outcry but i also think this will provide a positive spin on csu and dr daniels many contributions
2022832 it is an elaborate memento but i am not saying inappropriate
2022833 there are people at the university who thought and continue to think highly of dr daniel and would much rather she be remembered for the positive things than the few missteps that garnered the university some unwelcome publicity
2022834 that based on the evidence we had collected we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
2022835 it was an explanation of why bruce ivins was a suspect
2022836 but theres a total absence of proof that he committed this crime
2022837 we were able to determine that at no time could that individual be put in the presence of that flask from which these spores came
2022838 could provide no legitimate reason for the extended hours other than home was not good and he went there to escape from his life at home
2022839 significant since all of the anthrax laden letters were sent to
2022840 we have a flask thats effectively the murder weapon from which those spores were taken that was controlled by dr ivins
2022841 other scientists helped him create that anthrax and worked with it constantly
2022842 it is hard not to be convinced with what they have
2022843 it is mostly all circumstantial but they just have so much evidence i just cant see it being anybody else
2022844 its important that the f b i go on to release the scientific details
2022845 there are some pieces of evidence that are much more compelling than others and a number of loose ends that havent been tied
2022846 i was banned because i complained about bugs being in my food i went back and asked for a different plate of rice without bugs and they kicked me out for complaining they banned me for 60 days i wasnt the only one with bugs as another man had them too even the chef said there were bugs in the kitchen that day

2022848 a complete review of all of barnicles thousands of globe columns revealed an alleged fabrication in a column from three years earlier dated october 8 1995 the column recounted the story of two sets of parents with cancer stricken children when one of the boys a black child died the parents of the other boy a white child who had begun to recover sent the dead childs parents a check for 10 000 usd when the globe could not locate the people in the story who had not been publicly identified barnicle insisted that the story was true he said he did not obtain the story from the parents but from a nurse days after barnicle resigned over the controversy patricia shairs stepped forward to say that the 1995 column was the story of her son and another child at childrens hospital but as she had not spoken directly with barnicle the column contained some factual errors

2022880 in the short and medium term the internet has had an underwhelming effect on the real estate and home services industry
2022881 to clarify there are a lot of agents brokers contractors developers you name it that have done just fine with traditional marketing and referrals however in the long term the internet will have an overwhelming impact on this very same industry these same players will not continue to be able to effectively function going forward in the next few years without embracing web 2 0 techniques myfrontsteps and steprep will allow their customers to showcase their products and services via online social networks

2022894 the proof is always in the actions and not just the words
2022895 apparently its okay for george bush to take this nation to war on a lie to be responsible criminally responsible for well over 100 000 deaths but its not okay to prosecute him not only isnt it okay to prosecute him it isnt even okay to talk about prosecuting him this is unbelievable whats going on in this country how can we have a country where they permit a president to do what he did and they do absolutely nothing to him except to try to protect him
2022896 i heard your book on tape and im now convinced that george bush deceived congress
2022897 ive already bought several copies of your book and ive passed them out to colleagues and i told them read the book
2022898 there may be as many as one million victims not one victim but one million victims in their cold graves right now decomposing as a result of george bushs monumental crime
2022899 what person in authority on the face of this globe is representing these one million people in their graves fighting to bring about justice for them pursuing the person the guilty person who put them there
2022900 no you didnt hear what i said i said what person in authority is going after the killer of these million people
2022901 i dont have the authority of an emaciated moth i dont have any authority
2022902 i agree that he should bush should be prosecuted for murder and i hope he is prosecuted for murder
2022903 mr bugliosi come november im going to be out in the public with you and i want to be at your side when george bush hopefully is indicted for first degree murder
2022904 i support you and i want bush to be prosecuted for first degree murder
2022905 is there someone out there that i dont know about thats come forward
2022906 well yeah a lot of people are angry but they dont have the courage to do anything about it
2022907 the competition between social networks in japan is beginning to heat up with the recent introduction of the japanese language version of facebook
2022908 the popular social networking sites launch of spanish french and german language sites earlier this year resulted in strong traffic growth in these markets if this is a reliable indication we can expect to see facebooks growth in japan follow a similar trend

2022960 its a period movie set in victorian england so were very specific about the look we need
2022961 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game
2022962 rise of the argonauts is an epic game with some of the biggest greek heroes like jason hercules and achilles which inspired me to compose dramatic sweeping music to create the proper setting for this exciting adventure
2022963 in rise of the argonauts every design choice emphasises immersion we want players to actually feel like theyre heroes in ancient greece not just playing a game tylers experience with composing for film and tv gave him a fresh perspective and his music for the game set the epic tone we were hoping for

2023011 hi dad i was wondering if you happen to own a machete
2023012 biological reproduction is not a very efficient way to alleviate ones loneliness but you can make up people when youre motivated to do so
2023013 when people lack a sense of connection with other people they are more likely to see their pets gadgets or gods as human like
2023014 in the movie castaway tom hanks was isolated on an island and found the social desolation to be one of the most daunting challenges with which he had to deal
2023015 he did so in part by anthropomorphizing a volleyball wilson who became his friend and confidant while he was on the island
2023016 castaway depicts a deep truth about the irrepressibly social nature of homo sapiens
2023017 if we made them feel lonely they were also more likely to describe a pet even if it wasnt their own pet as having humanlike mental states that were related to social connection like being more thoughtful considerate and compassionate
2023018 its actually a greater risk for morbidity or mortality than cigarette smoking is being lonely is a bad thing for you
2023019 a brains not so sensitive to whether its a person or not if its something that has a lot of traits associated with what it means to be a human then all the better for us it seems
2023020 it may be that strong in group identity is one of the things that facilitates dehumanizing the opposing side
2023021 exercise pill switches on gene that tells cells to burn fat
2023022 scientists are well aware that tissue derived from someone elses embryonic stem cells would be recognized as foreign and rejected by the patient
2023023 this is one of the reasons why scientists have focused so much attention toward using nuclear transfer which would allow us to use adult stem cells from the same patient rather than those harvested from an unrelated embryo
2023024 using purified adult skin stem cells as our source of nuclei we have found that higher nuclear transfer efficiencies can be achieved
2023025 there are many diseases such as liver pancreatic and neurodegenerative disorders where researchers are only able to obtain affected tissue from autopsies

2023028 there are obvious applications since this adhesive works on wet surfaces
2023029 the challenge will be to produce large quantities of this glue without it sticking to everything that is used to produce it
2023030 using special mutants we can isolate the glue on glass surfaces we tried washing the glue off it didnt work
2023031 this extraordinary accomplishment is a technological marvel that was only made possible because of the unique and accomplished jcvi team
2023032 ham smith clyde hutchison dan gibson gwyn benders and the others on this team dedicated the last several years to designing and perfecting new methods and techniques that we believe will become widely used to advance the field of synthetic genomics
2023033 when we started this work several years ago we knew it was going to be difficult because we were treading into unknown territory
2023034 through dedicated teamwork we have shown that building large genomes is now feasible and scalable so that important applications such as biofuels can be developed
2023035 this is an exciting advance for our team and the field however we continue to work toward the ultimate goal of inserting the synthetic chromosome into a cell and booting it up to create the first synthetic organism
2023036 immoral or street corner gibberish uttered by one who wears a tinfoil hat
2023037 nothing will tick off tucsonans more than someone driving down from phoenix to tell them how to vote
2023038 imagine the long nerve fibers that run between the cells in the brain and lower spinal cord as major freeways
2023039 when theres a traffic accident on the freeway what do drivers do
2023040 when spinal cord damage blocked direct signals from the brain under certain conditions the messages were able to make detours around the injury the message would follow a series of shorter connections to deliver the brains command to move the legs
2023041 we were excited to see that most of the mice regained the ability to control their legs within eight weeks
2023042 they walked more slowly and less confidently than before their injury but still recovered mobility
2023043 when i was a medical student my professors taught that the brain and spinal cord were hard wired at birth and could not adapt to damage severe injury to the spinal cord meant permanent paralysis
2023044 this pessimistic view has changed over my lifetime and our findings add to a growing body of research showing that the nervous system can reorganize after injury
2023045 what we demonstrate here is that the body can use alternate nerve pathways to deliver instructions that control walking
2023046 our study has identified cells that we can target to try to restore communication between the brain and spinal cord
2023047 if we can use existing nerve connections instead of attempting to rebuild the nervous system the way it existed before injury our job of repairing spinal cord damage will become much easier
2023048 this study underscores the need to include more berries in the diet especially blueberries
2023049 our idea is not the final product but rather an energy delivery system
2023050 as a proof of principle that this kind of strategy could work weve shown that the first two enzymes could be attached to the same chip and act in series
2023051 we have a provisional patent so if a company shows interest we could also work something out with them
2023052 it has been previously assumed that freely selected plans might be stored in the middle regions of the prefrontal cortex whereas plans following external instructions could be stored on the surface of the brain we were able to confirm this theory in our experiments
2023053 the experiments show that intentions are not encoded in single neurons but in a whole spatial pattern of brain activity
2023054 intentions for future actions that are encoded in one part of the brain need to be copied to a different region to be executed
2023055 the mystery of consciousness quite good all the research is a bit intimidating to me though as i like being able to keep the workings of my brain within my own
2023056 one day even the intention to open the blue folder or reply to the email could be picked up by brain scanners and turned into appropriate action
2023057 this information coupled with our previous studies shows that the addition of walnuts berries and grape juice to the diet may increase health span in aging and provide a longevity dividend or economic benefit for slowing the aging process by reducing the incidence and delaying the onset of debilitating degenerative disease
2023058 the beneficial effects of walnuts also may be the direct result of enhancements of signals which mediate such important functions as neuronal communication and the growth of new neurons
2023059 is that it appears that compounds found in fruits and vegetables and as we have shown in our research walnuts may provide the necessary protection to prevent the demise of cognitive and motor function in aging
2023060 therefore they only have limited success in slowing the progression of the disease
2023061 initially we confirmed earlier results showing that walnut extract inhibits amyloid protein aggregation in the presence of acetylcholinesterase and breaks apart preformed aggregates
2023062 however the new findings have not been presented elsewhere or replicated by other laboratories to the best of our knowledge
2023063 to investigate dual inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase in efforts to develop more efficient pharmacological treatments for alzheimers disease
2023064 expanding our knowledge of natural products health benefits and their molecular targets in the nervous system would improve preventative measures and potentially reveal new therapeutic strategies to alleviate inflammation in the brain and spinal cord
2023065 these benefits along with other indirect mechanisms may help to minimize or reverse the age related breakdown of communication between neurons
2023066 analysis of dendritic branching and dendritic spines can accurately reflect the integrity of brain circuits and neuronal communication
2023067 would enhance the neuronal circuitry back to the status associated with a younger brain
2023068 diet of walnuts blueberries found to improve cognition may help maintain brain function and treat brain disorders
2023069 closing time two blocks too small for two brazilian restaurants in district vi

2023083 here are my bold predictions for the rest of the season let me know what you think
2023084 in seven years on the yankees beat i have learned to be skeptical with official information on injuries
2023085 the front offices managers and doctors are lying to them to keep them from getting the inside scoops that they feel they deserve that is their right to know
2023086 but if we could see the severity of those injuries why would the yankees front office try to downplay them doesnt that further damage their credibility
2023087 if brian cashman knows or thinks he knows at this moment that joba wont pitch again this year i dont see how its in the teams interest to divulge that info right now
2023088 my intent was that it was a significant injury and i mentioned that he shouldnt try
2023089 when i report the news i speak to players agents executives doctors experts in the field other players i know who have had similar injuries etc i try and get the best possible information not because i deserve it but because you do
2023090 in fact i reported what will carroll said that andrews is not a cutter and takes conservative rehab based routes i reported that he wouldnt be going to andrews unless the mri showed something which it did
2023091 meanwhile youre assuming what dr andrews said and what the yankees said are the same thing dr andrews does not directly report his findings to reporters he leaves it to the teams to dispense the news
2023092 ian and joba are best friends do you think maybe they talk the players know the truth about their injuries theyre there when the doctor says what they have cmon now
2023093 dfox kennedy knows hes the third trey he also knows that hes going to get about 5 6 starts to resurrect his season
2023094 kennedy has pressure on him either way just like last september no more no less
2023095 just because the yankees say its so doesnt make it the truth
2023096 the whole anthrax case would make for a good journalism class
2023097 we who work on the show care very much about it and are heartbroken over the possibility of not continuing production
2023098 unfortunately we have no say in what is going on we are simply forced to wait for the outcome
2023099 wealth maximiser plus is the first unit linked product in the indian life insurance industry to offer the opportunity of investing in managers fund a fund that offers a dynamic exposure between other equity and debt type funds
2023100 the whole anthrax case would make for a good journalism class
2023101 from my point of view it gave national credibility to have on the record attribution and not some anonymous scientists
2023102 somehow we were supposed to know that abc had shifted from
2023103 voice technology provides a breakthrough in information management and transmission we have developed our hr product line based upon voice technology with the idea of simplifying various operations like recruitment security and employee relations which in turn aid in cost cutting and increasing efficiency
2023104 theres no restrictions just bring a camera new people are always welcome you dont need any more invitation than that people are meeting in the coffee lounge navigation street at 2pm this sunday
2023105 whats that smell is something on fire it smells like something is burning it kind of smells electrical is the teakettle on did it boil dry is it inside or out the window
2023106 i guaranteed my seat in hell on the plane today
2023107 if the simpsons did a skit about waldorf schools the waving stump would totally be in it
2023108 i like you do you want to share a dime bag
2023109 i cant believe im gonna say this but i think you crossed a line
2023110 johnny depp you know he doesnt wipe he tries the bidet and moves on
2023111 although he is getting tired of me dropping my drawers in the living room
2023112 i cant wait to get home and get these underwear off
2023113 im interested in getting into more natural things but not granola in the sheets
2023114 i was going to do interpretive dance to accompany reading the quotes in the notebook but it wouldve been all obscene gestures
2023115 hes been a constant for us all year weve been able to count on him to take the ball every five days every start he gives us a good start
2023116 if moose pitches like this he can pitch as long as he wants
2023117 they need to bring him back next year where would we be without him
2023118 last football season at a similar point of the season with 30 of the season left did anyone think the giants had a legitimate shot at the super bowl
2023119 i read somewhere that last year mussina had someing close to 4 5 success at missing bats if thats the case that is brutal
2023120 as we see time and time again you can never have too much pitching 1 cc 2 wang 3 pettitte 4 moose 5 joba phil kennedy
2023121 i know its incredibly superstitious but i really wish alex would change his number i really do
2023122 thanks guys hmm thats weird i feel like if someones going to take on the big 13 it would be a entire career maybe even entire life thing ive always wondered why he chose 13 i guess he figured he couldnt have 3 so 13 is the next best thing but come on someone should have told him haha
2023123 if moose wins 20 he gets the cy young ynless the boston bias somehow gets lester it
2023124 this is it hes going to show us all why hes the greatest baseball player ever
2023125 well never see a professional sports franchise freeze up collectively like that again in our lifetimes
2023126 speaking of theres a host controversy conan to take over but leno not ready to abdicate
2023127 fallon is taking conans current spot at that time as well
2023128 what the yankees got was a catcher that has thrown out nearly 50 of all baserunners attempting to steal helped mike mussina become the de facto ace of the yankees staff worked well with every pitcher in the rotation and oh yeah hes played in 64 of the yankees 101 games thus far well on pace to break his career high of 78 games played in 2006
2023129 the ultimate goal is to put on that yankee uniform
2023130 but i dont want to get too far ahead of myself that doesnt do me any good
2023131 but i dont want to get too far ahead of myself that doesnt do me any good
2023132 dude was super awkward but at least he and richter were funny fallon was never ever ever funny and never will be
2023133 i think the industry as a whole needs to take a very different look at this business and participate more fully and in a much more partnership way
2023134 and if that does not become the case as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games
2023135 its a scheme that ranged from street operatives to the ceo of a hospital
2023136 within the past four years hundreds if not thousands of other homeless persons in skid row have been recruited hospitalized treated and discharged in a manner substantially similar as part of a long running scheme to bilk the medicare and medi cal programs out of millions of dollars by causing unnecessary hospitalization for paid recruits
2023137 today we are sending the message that those who would seek to defraud our health care system and those who would callously exploit mentally impaired and drug addicted homeless men and women to turn a profit will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
2023138 these criminals thought they could get away with this scheme because they figured no one cares about the homeless on skid row they were dead wrong
2023139 at first when i saw all these agents in all their shirts i thought it must be a training exercise
2023140 but then i realized it was the real thing they told me i couldnt go back to my work area
2023141 all this talk about an agreement that has supposed to have been reached which is being reported is utter nonsense
2023142 the talks are going on well and the people of shall be informed in due course once an agreement has been reached
2023143 the government as mediator wont give details except to say that the negotiations are progressing extremely well
2023144 it has been suggested before today that the ministry of information a post moyo held before his departure from zanu pf would be offered back to him by mugabe i reckon that it would be more fun if the position be given to bright matonga zimbabwes comical ali as at least we would have something to laugh about within the zimbabwean crisis moyo cannot be trusted in a new political dispensation as he has since independence shown that he has the political colours of a chameleon and cannot be trusted in a new political dispensation
2023145 he crafted mugabes violent campaign for the june 27 elections
2023146 moyo is such a usable person who can change overnight and can do anything for money he was with the mdc before the march 29 elections but later dumped the party to craft a violent re election for mugabe
2023147 if mugabe is to be a ceremonial president then he has no need for the central bank or defence this would effectively allow mugabe with key control in government and my understanding of the basic agreement is that as ceremonial president mugabe would not have anything to do with day to day governance which negates the need to control the bank and defence unless tsvangirai has real executive power then the whole thing will break down almost immediately
2023148 there is no mechanism for this transition to be policed so who will tsvangirai appeal to if zanu pf break out of the deal once they have got their hands on some international finance
2023149 unless home affairs justice and the reserve bank are out of zanu pf hands there can be no deal that the people can trust
2023150 i found about nine trillion dollars z 9 000 in the new currency about us 60 on the first day of my secret treasure hunt and half of that the following day but the gold mine is drying up now
2023151 they wonder how they will relate to him after they issued statements before the elections that they would not salute him if he won
2023152 ubs had an obligation to provide nhhelco with all available information about market conditions and look out for nhhelcos best interests in order that we can fulfill our important mission
2023153 we trusted ubs and paid millions of dollars to them and still have no solution to our credit crisis they turned their back on us just when we needed their support when ubs failed to support nhhelcos bonds it failed to support the students and parents in new hampshire
2023154 the relief nhhelco seeks is a letter of credit from ubs which nhhelco can use to ultimately provide access to private and federal loans for students
2023155 our mission is to make sure the securities laws of our state are fulfilled including selling agents investment advisors and broker dealers
2023156 ubs acted as a broker dealer and also as investment banking advisor in terms of their securitization of student loans through the auction rate securities market
2023157 our focus in this matter has been to investigate whether there has been any securities violations by ubs
2023158 we are consistently working with regulators toward a comprehensive solution for all ars investors
2023159 we are working diligently to facilitate a resolution of students needing loans right now
2023160 this recent re design of our mini pendant light section matches our corporate goal perfectly by providing our customers with both an easy to use intuitive web site and competitive pricing on these beautiful mini pendants
2023161 and with a kid on my arm im still exceptional at anal you want a piece of me
2023162 its been a while since we last met do you want to fill me in on whats been happening with you
2023163 bless me father for i have sinned it has been 10 months since my last confession
2023164 dr x is on holiday but if you want i can ask her if she wants to sit in on the next session
2023165 because of tight manufacturing tolerances the design and the precision of the extrusions the frames in the nevada plant are able to focus the mirrors quite precisely on the heat transfer tubes
2023166 for the spain project we were able to apply the lessons learned in fabricating the frames for nevada solar one and do it more quickly and efficiently
2023167 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2023168 georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom
2023169 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2023170 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2023171 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2023172 the us believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2023173 and youll see the upcoming dates and times for that specific event
2023174 the original game design did not include any shooting of enemy ships i was still a peace loving hippie at heart and didnt want to create a game in which you had to shoot things
2023175 he wanted to know if this was a gameplay related choice or a moral choice i hedged a bit and then admitted it was really a moral choice he said it needs a fire button we reworked the game so you could shoot at the saucers and gun emplacements
2023176 they focus too much on the technology e g flashy graphics and not enough on story and characters
2023177 it was a great time and i highly recommend political vindication radio for anyone interested in some solid political talk radio
2023178 i enjoyed the show thoroughly frank and shane are solid hosts and asked some questions that i really enjoyed answering
2023179 that was so much fun and i have to say you guys are real pros almost intimidating youre so good at it
2023180 let me say it was a pleasure to talk to you guys and be asked such important and intelligent questions
2023181 maddie is explaining to me again why my marriages have failed
2023182 in his relationships bernie always starts out as a romantic and ends up as an accountant
2023183 i guess the idea behind economics is one of opportunity costs of tradeoffs at the margin you can spend more money on guns or spend it on butter and depending on which way you go youll either create more or less happiness
2023184 you cant make choices at the margin in a relationship
2023185 you either choose to be in it or not and you do that bernie at the start you choose the woman
2023186 but after that you turn into an accountant bernie you want reciprocity at every turn its like youve turned a relationship into a series of transactions
2023187 this economics fallacy might be why men are so good at business and economics and so bad at relationships you have this tendency to turn relationships into a series of transactions doing your marginal analysis at every turn looking for some way to get the most for the least
2023188 bernie relationships are not like that shouldnt be like that if you want a real relationship you play a different game you work out a different equation you give as much as you can because you realize that you want your life to be as much as it can be you are never more than your relationships bernie dont turn into an accountant once you find yourself in love love is not about cost cutting
2023189 yeah but i think that the marginal thing is right
2023190 i mean think about kissing or making love to a woman
2023191 as if you do anything else with your imagination at that age
2023192 you kiss her once say and its wonderful you kiss her the tenth time and it is nice you kiss her a hundred times and its almost tiresome
2023193 im just saying its a marginal thing love kisses they are a marginal thing after awhile you put more in but you dont get that much more out
2023194 shes right even a kiss is not a marginal thing
2023195 a kiss might be like a meal sure you get full at one setting but you get hungry again and a favorite food is a favorite food you long for it even more when you can recollect enjoying it in the past when it becomes the part of layered memories the food becomes something you love for its own sake and also for the memories it now has wrapped up in it a kiss is like that only more so
2023196 but you got tired of kissing the same woman uncle bernie eventually it doesnt have the same oomph right for a kiss to wake you up it needs to be new woman no some new technique
2023197 no the woman is everything technique is vastly over rated a new pair of lips is not the point a kiss at its best is an expression so thick with meaning appreciation so keen that it can never be expressed in a mere handshake or simple hug a kiss is inevitable once you feel a particular way towards her the mouth
2023198 the mouth is the place from which we breathe taste the world and express ourselves if youve fallen in love with a woman how could you not want to melt into her at that very spot this small opening into her being how could you not want to kiss her
2023199 you dont manufacture this feeling by starting with a fresh pair of lips if you simply kiss a woman no matter how good your technique there is no guarantee that youll feel this kind of adoration and desire this pleasure of getting to be one with her this realization of what it means to be a part of someone so splendid shes right delbert its a whole thing not a marginal thing that is if you want to feel whole
2023200 when you are older you will understand how precious little things seemingly of no value in themselves can be loved and prized above all price when they convey the love and thoughtfulness of a good heart
2023201 heres a guy who was very quick on the political trigger by joining bloombergs coalition of gun grabbing municipal chief executives
2023202 but he really misfired when he violated his bond agreement and crossed the border into canada last month without telling the court in advance the behavior that got him into this legal quagmire suggests that kilpatrick considers himself above the law
2023203 new yorks mayor is lucky hes not facing charges for that vigilante gun shop sting operation he mounted two years ago because it interfered with legitimate federal investigations did kilpatrick think that he would also avoid trouble even though he lied under oath about a relationship he had with his former chief of staff
2023204 is hardly the face id want representing any group of mayors if i were michael bloomberg
2023205 mayors against illegal guns has been campaigning against a constitutionally protected fundamental civil right under the guise of crime control
2023206 i always feel most at home onstage much more than in an interview
2023207 gone country 2 the follow up to the networks highest rated series ever
2023208 you practice 90 percent of the time and sleep the other 10 percent its really hard physically and mentally its a challenge
2023209 whoevers standing at the end of this marathon recording deserves the crown
2023210 favourite dancer of 2008 muraine starts standing in this crazy move and alternates between pushing his chin and sternum backwards until he is all the way on the floor
2023211 i didnt need cabs when i was younger because i used to take the bus to school the school bus and then when i went to high school in st johns i had my own car so i was never in a cab so it was really exciting to be in one
2023212 i think she deserved to win and everything and i think shell be very successful
2023213 smoke em smoke em smoke em if ya got them and if you dont got em then youve hit rock bottom
2023214 ryan sheckler is an authorized unpaid spokesperson for childrens cancer research fund and is not compensated in any way 100 of money raised goes to childrens cancer research fund
2023215 learning that auxin regulates tir1 is a huge advance for plant biology that will probably have important implications for agriculture in the future
2023216 its a bonus for us that tir1 is related to proteins in other organisms including humans some of tir1s human relatives play a role in different human cancers and it is possible that our work on plants will eventually lead to new cancer drugs
2023217 although ubiquitin ligases have long been recognized as potential drug targets for treating cancers and other human diseases its been a bumpy road for scientists to come up with a feasible approach
2023218 the mechanism by which auxin works points out a new direction for us to develop therapeutic compounds targeting ubiquitin ligases
2023219 a number of human disorders including parkinsons disease and colon and breast cancers are caused by defective interactions between ubiquitin ligases and their substrate polypeptides what the plant hormone tells us is that it might be possible to rescue these interactions using small molecules
2023220 discovery in plants suggests entirely new approach to treating human cancers
2023221 this adoptive transfer vaccine approach is important not only for the long term benefits it provides but also for what it doesnt provide harmful side effects
2023222 even if this new vaccine does not cure alzheimers disease it may significantly slow down the disease process and thus provide years of quality life to individuals diagnosed with the disease
2023223 in summary our findings show that a restricted immune response to a is sufficient to reverse cognitive impairment and lessen some brain pathology in ad transgenic mice over a surprisingly long period of time we conclude that endogenous mechanisms repress immune responses to a and that boosting a specific th2 responses overrides that repression which aids in lowering soluble a within the brain without activating a global inflammatory response or inducing meningoencephalitis therefore the adoptive transfer 16 of a specific t cells represents a novel approach to the treatment of alzheimers disease that may have substantial therapeutic potential
2023224 dozens of specific sequences will be required for effectively treating the majority of patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy
2023225 but in order to realize the promise of personalized molecular medicine in muscular dystrophies and ultimately other disorders it will be important to re evaluate current measures of toxicity efficacy and marketing that ensure both safety for the patient as well as rapid development and distribution of life saving drugs
2023226 the patients and their families are crossing their fingers that the drugs overall chemistry can be shown to be safe
2023227 new clinical trial results show how personalized medicine will alter treatment of genetic disorders
2023228 happier learn the secrets to daily joy and lasting fulfillment
2023229 a brain tumor the best thing that ever happened to me
2023230 i quit watching the news on tv in the morning i prefer reading the news on your website why start the day with negative information when you can start it with positive information it really has improved my attitude towards everyday life im in a good mood after reading the news on your website everyday people need to learn to focus on the postive rather than the negative theres so much good in this world
2023231 thank you for writing your newsletter some good news i enjoyed reading the positive stories i am heartened by thegoodness and generosity that i see in people keep up your good work
2023232 when the war in iraq started i went into a depression state i feltconstantly worried and agitated and it was hard to enjoy doing things iloved to do then i found your site it lifted my spirits and helped get me out ofthe funk i was in now im going to school and enjoying the things ilike to do whenever i feel depressed i visit your site
2023233 when i get to work in the morning iget my coffee jump online and read the news every day i went home sadand depressed then i found your site and after reading the first storyi immediately felt my spirits lift i never went home sad again reading ordinary news gives us a sense that thats all there is butyour site reminds us that there is more and the world is not as bad asthe news would lead us to believe thank you for everything
2023234 we were surprised at the magnitude of the difference between the two cultural groups and also at how widespread the engagement of the brains attention system became when making judgments outside the cultural comfort zone
2023235 everyone uses the same attention machinery for more difficult cognitive tasks but they are trained to use it in different ways and its the culture that does the training
2023236 its fascinating that the way in which the brain responds to these simple drawings reflects in a predictable way how the individual thinks about independent or interdependent social relationships
2023237 we got a 10 fold life span extension that is i think the longest one that has ever been achieved in any organism
2023238 people with two copies of the mutations have very small stature and other defects
2023239 we are now identifying the relatives with only one copy of the mutation who are apparently normal we hope that they will show a reduced incidence of diseases and an extended life span
2023240 maybe it will do nothing but having nothing else i think its certainly a good thing to try
2023241 we identified three transcription factors that are very important for the effect of calorie restriction but at the same time we also showed that its not enough because even without these transcription factors calorie restriction can still extend life span a little bit
2023242 so that means that weve identified a lot of the key players in the calorie restriction effect but not all of them
2023243 if it was hot rod then they would at least make him red
2023244 no really what would optimus do with a little peice of all spark what would you do you saw how frenzy used it to get his body parts back if you were optimus you would bring back jazz because ironhide is a jackass and oh yeah if bumble bees legs were ripped of shouldnt he be half a car
2023245 our main goal is to get the most detailed images and remote sensing data ever of the geologically active features on enceladus
2023246 from this data we may learn more about how eruptions tectonics and seismic activity alter the moons surface we will get an unprecedented high resolution view of the active area immediately following the closest approach
2023247 knowing the sizes of the particles their rates and what else is mixed in these jets can tell us a lot about whats happening inside the little moon
2023248 wed like to refine our numbers and see which fracture or stripe is hotter than the rest because these results can offer evidence one way or the other for the existence of liquid water as the engine that powers the plumes
2023249 bill to impose sanctions with respect to iran to provide for the divestment of assets in iran by state and local governments and other entities to identify locations of concern with respect to transshipment reexportation or diversion of certain sensitive items to iran and for other purposes
2023250 if countries fail to cooperate with such initiatives then under subsection b the administration would be required to designate a country as a destination of diversion concern exports to a country designated as a destination of diversion concern would be subject to additional licensure requirements more stringent license review which could result in fewer approvals or more conditions on licenses delayed authorizations due to increased end user checks and finally a decrease in authorizations due to diversion risks for such countries
2023251 so these are the things they use pigs to find
2023252 hey weve got this jingle everybody in the world knows it lets try to capitalize on that by making it a pop tune and build it from there
2023253 i think fairies has the potential to be as big as princesses
2023254 we were fundamentally missing an opportunity in terms of getting tinker bell out there as a character
2023255 they brought with them an illustration that had been used when they were working on the animated bambi it was a beautiful illustration of a dove
2023256 the only thing she says in barrie is silly ass thats her line and she tries to have wendy killed a couple of times
2023257 but she also saves peter she drinks the poison to keep peter from drinking it i built on that on her love for peter her loyalty her courage she is not in my mind a warm fuzzy character
2023258 the big challenge disney has is to change it on one hand so it becomes more modern and appealing for the next generation but on the other hand theyre almost changing a religion they can very easily trip and fall down
2023259 you know how kids at a certain age start looking out the window and ask questions that parents have an impossible time answering why do leaves turn colors why are there dew drops those kinds of things
2023260 this is the perfect answer for every parent the fairies did it
2023261 that sense of fantasy that you create in the film that you want to bring alive in the parks and with the characters
2023262 a small javascript library that should simplify your work with vector graphics on the web in case you want to create your own specific chart or image crop n rotate widget you can simply achieve it with this library
2023263 i keep saying im not sure if this is true or not true im making the team and now im the first guy coming to the stadium and the whole world will be watching me carry the flag there are no words to describe it
2023264 premieres wednesday aug 6 at 9 p m cdt exclusively on
2023265 this includes javascript lt gt python object translations and a callback mechanism for python responses to custom events fired in the javascript environment
2023266 we believe there was a lot of democrat switchover vote
2023267 it is legal in the state of tennessee for democrats to go switch their allegiance in a primary
2023268 im sorry but you just kinda feel like goin to have a beer and watch a hockey game
2023269 when our mothers and our fathers and our sisters were hung and out siblings and our spouses were hung its a hate situation
2023270 its in our community its in our workplace individuals are being bold and are challenged to do what they want to do but we have to be in a place to make these individuals understand that there are consequences for their actions
2023271 we made all the necessary arrangements to ensure smooth running of this activity at forum mall and the response has been tremendous we would like to thank all the celebrities amp listeners who came over to the mall to support both our rjs harsha amp shruthi fight for this social cause

2023274 cheneys been very effective in setting up his deniability and always being the failsafe for bush unless they start waterboarding the vice president which it not too likely he is the man the trail ends right there
2023275 this is what the proud daughter of a warrior clan comes to
2023276 well this condition is forty percent likely in women thirty percent in men
2023277 it was announced that fanboys will be released to theaters on 19 september 2008
2023278 is the person who is in the car behind the wheel the real kyle busch
2023279 no not really i mean you know what you see on tv what you see on cameras and what you see you know behind the wheel of the car isnt necessarily a person or who they are and so for me thats who i am is what everybody sees on tv they dont see me off the track
2023280 theres a perception that maybe youve come back to the pack a little bit is that kinda the price you pay for having such a hot start a series leading seven wins
2023281 well i havent won for two weeks im in a drought right now were sort of in a cooling off period
2023282 how does it feel that 50 percent of the people dont like you
2023283 theres more than 50 percent of them that dont like me that was a generous percentage there but it doesnt matter
2023284 did you ever think kids would want to be you
2023285 i never thought that it would ever happen but i always wanted to be like jeff gordon growing up and so now theres probably kids that would like to be like kyle busch hopefully
2023286 what do want people to say about kyle busch when youre done
2023287 well ive got a long road ahead me hopefully where im going to be here for a few more years so to develop a legacy would mean winning championships and winning ultimately the most races of the year every year be a guy like jeff gordon was in the 90s be a guy like jimmie johnson is now and what dale earnhardt was in the 80s and 90s and so its a way of racing youll be remembered for a lot of different things but to me hopefully just being one of the best
2023288 although the nra and i certainly have had our disagreements over the years i hope that we can agree that the gun violence prevention debate should be based upon an open and honest exchange of ideas not on underhanded tactics
2023289 was this the real opening ceremony tune in to find out
2023290 the cossacks cannot remain impartial to the fate of a fraternal republic
2023291 in the condition of aggression from georgia the don cossacks of voronezh region who support the course of the south ossetian authorities toward independence are prepared to take a stand among the defenders of the republic
2023292 all volunteers will be taken by bus to stavropol where the mobilization staff of the great don host is already operating from there they will be sent to south ossetia where they will serve in special units particularly the omon special forces under contract
2023293 run by a gun zealot whos too blinded by the nra
2023294 palestine was a country torn by war not so much between jews and arabs from 1939 after the arab revold had subsided until the un decision on palestine in november 1947 the level of violence between the two communitites remained low but between the jews and the mandatory authorities
2023295 the morning after the un general assembly ratified the partition resolution palestine was swept by an outbreak of violence which signalled the begninning of a civil war that was to last until 15 may 1948 the first attacks were perptrated by palestinians against jews
2023296 ye olde tyranny of the majority whose doctrine says that if 51 percent of the people vote to strip the other 49 percent of their god given rights then thats just too bad for them
2023297 the folks who champion their legislative approach have been mikes most vehement critics in the gun blogosphere so whats with lying to the world that this somehow has nra sanction
2023298 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2023299 each area of the webscape has its own unique security challenges but the top 100 web properties that encompass the largest amount of visitors is a growing target of attackers
2023300 research shows that attackers continue to focus their attention on the web 2 0 elements of the evolving webscape meaning that adaptive content classification and dynamic content scanning is now required to protect businesses and their information
2023301 hackers will continue to get creative and leverage user created content and web 2 0 applications to create even bigger security concerns for organizations
2023302 researchers expect attackers to see a rise in special interest attacks targeting specific groups of people based on interests and profiles with an increase in spam and talk back sections of new sites new active media web modules scripting and social networks organizations will need to ensure their web messaging and data security programs are adequate to plug the holes and curb the new avenues hackers exploit to spread malicious code for financial gain
2023303 we are expecting the unexpected our preparations are constantly changing
2023304 climate change must be a wholly legitimate subject of protest and demonstration but if it is met by an arbitrary destructive and aggressive police response the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent law abiding people particularly the young
2023305 what we are doing is part of a long tradition of civil disobedience
2023306 were not blas about breaking the law but the threat that new coal poses to our future on this planet more than justifies the actions we are taking
2023307 the searches have been absurdly over the top with everything from 26 foot banners to disabled access ramps taken away
2023308 its a concerted attempt to demonise people and alienate members of the public so they dont think it is safe to come here its a depressing a chilling attack on the right to freedom of expression and assembly
2023309 the climate change debate in the workshop was of a higher calibre than in the house of commons

2023312 the war room is a rich detailed and substantive primer on how to run a winning war room warts pizza boxes smelly couches and all from a master war roomer
2023313 kinsella has crafted a handy little guide for politicos and non politicos alike just keep it away from the kids

2023317 uncles and brothers i have none but that mans father is my fathers son
2023318 what do you see the purpose of an author blog
2023319 russia wont leave unpunished deaths of our compatriots the guilty will carry the well deserved punishment
2023320 the actions of georgia led to human victims including amid russias peacekeepers the situation progressed to the extent when peacekeepers of georgia were firing at russias peacekeepers together with whom they should accomplish their mission of keeping peace in the region
2023321 i knew she had a friend in australia someone that she had met through the game
2023322 anyone who promotes their own blogs should be exterminated is anybody interested really who cares i got out of bed today i had food i performed bodily functions i walked the dogs i had food i went back to bed i sneezed how fascinating is that
2023323 y ou half wit if she wants to have a child with you lets hope it doesnt inherit your moronic stupidity and shallowness wipe the drool from this imbeciles face please
2023324 this guy is tres funny his observations are both witty and at times biting social commentary

2023327 i know where you live and im going to get you c nt
2023328 and some of those tactics very frankly you mention the war in iraq are somewhat like that we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement
2023329 the right approach to web strategy the knowledge economy and social media
2023330 companies tend to push messages out through the wall but what they need to do is engage with people inside the wall
2023331 only 10 percent of your employees will want to engage
2023332 people should be given as much freedom as they can be given
2023333 it used to be restricted to top level executives but the ability to do it now is so much easier if youre good at something youre nuts not to talk about it
2023334 i normally tell clients not to worry about it for the first 6 months but i understand that people need ongoing budget there is an ongoing cost in terms of the number of hours or dedicated staffing needed
2023335 look for client satisfaction specifically check your call centres if the amount of time it takes to solve a problem has diminished because more people are accessible and available then that contributes to the bottom line
2023336 the great case study for this is a software company called sap they created their developer network with the sap staff getting involved as well here youve got a self perpetuating community of 1 2 million people some are non sap staff but theyre still experts its amazingly functional solves the problem and saves the sap a huge amount of money
2023337 as i spent a lot of years working in government i track a few government bloggers as well
2023338 clear standards by outlining which types of treatment offer couples the best chance of conceiving based on the best available evidence from around the world
2023339 let me be absolutely clear that the picture painted by the review team report is appalling and completely unacceptable the absence of clear lines of professional responsibility has fostered an environment where there was an inadequate management of a cluster of cases at ward level or awareness at higher levels there were also inadequacies and inconsistencies in advice to relatives and in management of patients
2023340 a direct and unconditional apology for the serious failings on its part
2023341 i recognise the concerns of relatives of patients that they were not properly informed every step of the way of the infection and how to help protect themselves and others from the risk of infection
2023342 as a result of todays recommendations we will take forward further actions to reinforce leadership accountability and empowerment both at the ward and hospital level and ensure clear lines of communication and responsibility to the boards medical and nurse directors
2023343 the uncertainty over the future of this local hospital has undoubtedly been a factor in the lack of major modernisation investments i can give a commitment that this board will bring forward proposals in august and september that will set out a clear vision for the future of the site
2023344 the vale of leven certainly had more cases of c difficile than one would expect during the first six months of 2008 sadly c difficile is a germ that is in the community and there will always be sick and vulnerable patients especially among the elderly who will develop c difficile associated diseases
2023345 was proud of the fact that not one jew had ever set foot into the homes he shared with his wife
2023346 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2023347 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2023348 no englishman can open his mouth without causing another englishman to despise him
2023349 this house will in no circumstances fight for king and country
2023350 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
2023351 this absence of novelized work makes a book that restricts itself to the 9 to 5 like ed parks cubicle opera personal days shine all the more park points out that those dead stressed hours make up a separate reality
2023352 its doubled again to 415 hotspots mostly from west kalimantan
2023353 the air quality has been unhealthy for the last few days
2023354 not to sound like a downer but this has sweep written all over it unless andy shows us something
2023355 jered weaver impressed you that much when the yankees faced him 6 days ago
2023356 trust me every yankee batter on the roster has had worse streaks that the one rodriguez had every one
2023357 let mussina be the perfect example of why pitch location and command are the pitchers best arsenal
2023358 will run production show up over the weekend with key hits and not necessarily by swinging for the fences
2023359 pete is calling feinsand a tabloid reporter can we stir this into a beat reporter throw down
2023360 sadly before i could break the seal on the chivas regal i saw my reading error im now depressed
2023361 the game for me is on the offense tonight to get runs for him early
2023362 i would have hoped that kennedy would have made his return someplace else without the additional pressure and confusion
2023363 and hes commanded his slider a little bit more its more consistent with the tilt to it hes not hanging as many hes more consistent hes got a better feel for it that just comes with repetition
2023364 the boston globe is reporting that the commissioners office is investigating the circumstances of manny ramirezs departure the red sox a source with direct knowledge of the inquiry told the globe that bud selig directed mlb executive vice president rob manfred to contact all parties for an explanation of how things unfolded around last weeks trading deadline according to the source manfred has yet to report back to the commissioner the reason behind the investigation according to the report is that some believe ramirez was playing at less than full effort at the end of his tenure in boston of course all manny did in july was hit a mere 347 473 587 in 22 games
2023365 why you andy money to get cc keep andy and get cc and use jason money jorge can play first base and switch hit
2023366 i couldnt give a rats asp about the tabloids all i ask is that he hits according to the game situation not his place on the all time hr list if arod wins 3 rings as a yankee and never gets to aaron and bonds ill love the guy if he gets the hr record and hasnt won at least 2 rings he will be a complete waste of 10 yrs
2023367 why you andy money to get cc keep andy and get cc and use jason money jorge can play first base and switch hit
2023368 why would pettitte have pitched his way out of a contract
2023369 all anyone is saying is for 28m per season with a runner on third and one one dont swing at a pitch a foot outside the plate and strike out get a sac fly a bloop single anything to score the run from third but god forbid arod doesnt hit a home run to pad his stats hes never been a team first guy and never will be
2023370 for the money hes making he has to come through
2023371 it feels like its almost to that point where i can throw a full start
2023372 cashman didnt give the team any depth in the rotation
2023373 if the yankees can make the playoffs with a stretch run staff that includes sidney ponson dan giese and ian kennedy their postseason streak may never end
2023374 with matsui saying hes feeling good and damon playing cf do you think he may come back ive found it surprising he wasnt moved to the 60dl after the nady trade
2023375 throughout the game hughes kept having success with an 87 89 mph pitch that seemed to have more movement than his regular fastball but too much velocity for a slider he used it to strike out george kottaras in the first inning he used it to get a double play in the second and he threw it off the plate to setup a 93 mph fastball for his final strikeout in the fifth i thought he might be taking something off his fastball and getting a little extra movement but no new pitch new to me anyway
2023376 pinstripe plus board is saying the yankees won the claim for houston street any truth to this
2023377 its possible they won the claim if theyre looking to block boston though who could probably use huston they could use anyone at this point
2023378 so expecting that our best hitter should be able to drive in a run from 3rd base with less than 2 outs more than 40 of the time is an unrealistic expectation
2023379 could there be some truth to the dead arm thing andys era is ove 12 for his last 2 starts
2023380 its great that abreu and giambi will sit around in their at bats and try to draw walks but someone needs to actually knock in runs
2023381 xavier playing the wall in right field would be sexy can we all agree on that
2023382 if we see melancon start pitching in back to back games theres a good chance he gets called up soon
2023383 i guess they forgot when he missed 3 weeks they were dead last in the al hitting w risp and 10th overall in offense for the time span he missed
2023384 hed melancon come up at the expense of robertson wouldnt he damn
2023385 im a big fan of the big sexy it was even my user name until peter asked me to change it
2023386 i doubt robertson is going anywhere especially after that basesloaded houdini act in texas
2023387 last night was very telling pitch him aggressively and then walk giambi oi
2023388 ted williams great though he be must learn that he is not more important than baseball the red sox or the american league
2023389 if his noodle swells another inch master ted williams of the boston red sox wont be able to get his hat on with a shoehorn
2023390 anybody who saw him in the holiday double header would say the boston fans are justified in anything up to throwing him into the charles river his one long hit of the day was well belted but he gave up and settled for a double
2023391 it wasnt until he became williams the 80 000 and 100 000 salaried ballplayer that he began to indulge himself in such peccadilloes as grounding to the second baseman and walking to the bench without taking a token stride to first base
2023392 playing himself into the mix in 2009 was not thinking i was considering
2023393 if the yankees can make the playoffs with a stretch run staff that includes sidney ponson dan giese and ian kennedy their postseason streak may never end
2023394 he he wouldnt hit the ball so hard he could move the runners over and wouldnt hit into so many dps hes hit into 8 this year now you can try to top that logic
2023395 also key to mussinas rebound has been the increased number of ground balls hes been able to coax remember his 1 15 gb fb ratio he posted in 07 this year hes trending even further to the ground ball side with a 1 55 gb fb ratio even with a sub par defense behind him we can expect his overall number of outs to increase given the fact hes throwing more grounders but its important to note that the left side of the yankee infield has improved from last year while cano at second has largely maintained his efficiency
2023396 i like it here i love wearing the pinstripes there is so much history and now they have a new stadium on the horizon i hear its amazing hopefully ill be here for awhile
2023397 my mom found a photo of me wearing a yankees helmet

2023472 it is dunkins intention to beat the franchisees into financial submission at which time dunkin will swoop down and take their stores for pennies on the dollar
2023473 will kussell the president of dunkin told us that we would receive phone calls from each of the three private equity firms looking to buy dunkin
2023474 we were told to vouch for the company on how well it was doing how we were operating as franchisees and the type of relationship we had with dunkin
2023475 my opinion was valuable to dunkin in selling its business for 2 4 billion
2023476 but then the company didnt want to hear from us i tried to get in touch with my local director the regional vice president and even with will kussell i eventually wrote a letter to ceo and chairman john luther which i hand delivered to him at our meeting in detroit last november but i got no response from anyone
2023477 you see how his loyalty was repaid they use their top franchisees to get what they want and then discard them
2023478 its own analysts have declared detroit an economically depressed market
2023479 we have no comment at this current time regarding this complaint filed by detroit area franchisees except to say that it is without merit
2023480 best show of the year hands down best show of the year
2023481 we must look at the substantial successes we have been able to achieve but also reflect on how far we have to go
2023482 governments in the past have been complicit in genocides land seizures massive environmental degradation and many other human rights abuses because indigenous peoples were denied their fundamental rights and freedoms

2023602 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
2023603 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
2023604 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
2023605 if even the people who created the character nicolae carpathia dont see the comparisons as warranted then perhaps this is overblown

2023673 there has been a lot of interest in scaling down optical devices
2023674 its really a very simple geometry and i was surprised that no one had come up with it before

2023718 based on advice of counsel we believe that the nhpucs order contains a number of significant legal errors that undermine its validity accordingly we expect to seek a rehearing before the nhpuc thereafter if necessary we will consider an appeal to the new hampshire supreme court which must be filed within 30 days of a ruling by the nhpuc on the rehearing the full rehearing and appeal process could take a year or more if the citys right to take the utility assets is ultimately upheld its aldermanic board would then still have to decide whether or not to proceed with the taking assuming it is able to finance the purchase

2023738 there is no excuse for the legislatures failure to reach a compromise and to send me a budget
2023739 until the legislature passes a budget that i can sign i will not sign any bills that reach my desk
2023740 but we do not have the luxury of stretching out this process any longer
2023741 they shouldnt be paid and they should never get that money back
2023742 my fear is that simply creates another tension between the administration and the legislature that is really unnecessary
2023743 many of the bills the legislature passes do california more harm than good
2023744 in light of our cash flow improvements i respectfully urge the governor to reconsider his executive order
2023745 costly litigation is something we should avoid because those are precious resources that should be spent on education health and welfare and other services californians expect and deserve

2023768 for the next several months the well publicized turmoil in the credit markets is expected to have a negative effect on the home sales that are channeled through our established retail network although we have been very successful in developing alternative channels of distribution for our modular products the companys revenue and earnings in the second half of 2008 will undoubtedly be negatively affected by the unusually slow sales rate at the retail sales centers on the other hand the reduction of capacity by competitors in our market area and the passage of the new federal housing relief bill may result in an offsetting positive effect with its strong modular backlog the company anticipates continued profitable operations throughout the last six months of 2008 however continuation of the record pace set in the first half of the year is certainly not assured

2023771 spring 2009 but one thing they have going for them is that movie theaters are generally much easier to build cookie cutter style than a typical condo so well see

2023775 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2023776 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2023777 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself

2023798 there was an incident that happened and some of ours were involved
2023799 in the private sector community our biggest hazard is transportation
2023800 generally speaking the fatality rate is one of the highest in aviation period
2023801 years back there was an incident in construction but weve never had an incident with serious injury or fatality fighting fire
2023802 most incidents relate to old buildings which have now been demolished at pembury hospital there is no specific problem
2023803 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
2023804 we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
2023805 we receive a wide range of information on hygiene from different sources
2023806 clearly it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time
2023807 however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems and if they persist trusts should question whether they have the right systems in place
2023808 if we were concerned that the safety of patients was at risk through poor hygiene standards or in any other way we would take immediate action
2023809 hospitals must be responsible for ensuring their buildings are clean and that patient safety is not compromised
2023810 trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards
2023811 the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle pest problems
2023812 it is also worth bearing in mind that trusts are likely to have recorded and reported figures differently and therefore the table may not be comparing like for like data
2023813 children have a natural inclination to play and explore and until they reach around the age of 3 this is directed by the parents hopefully helping them to deepen their curiosity and learn to use language to explore the world
2023814 once they reach 3 they are interested in social play which becomes a major feature of their activities boredom shouldnt last long if children are in the right environment where theyre dragged off either by curiosity or the desire to socialise it continues only if theres no one to play with or the environments too restrictive
2023815 parents should not be pals their role is as a parent not as a friend and children need to make their own friends
2023816 schools clubs and other activities are now very much leader related
2023817 unstructured play is becoming rarer with no moving as a pack or just getting on with activities children always expect and want to relate individually to whomever is in charge and we now have 18 19 20 year olds who can only function effectively like that students are far less confident than they were 15 years ago far less likely to make a decision by themselves and with little aspiration to get things moving without someone else being in charge and directing them
2023818 people often report that when they are bored they do nothing
2023819 the brain sucks up a fifth of our energy and our children are the most heavily assessed in europe some genuine downtime seems due
2023820 one of the features that has arisen in peoples reports so far is a loneliness that comes with boredom as well as the inadequacy of grasping on to any kind of activity to relieve it im starting to believe that being bored is a signal to stop doing other things and to re engage socially ive always suggested that social activity is best a family beach trip playing football having a picnic

2023843 the goal behind the inspection so far is that we want to focus on the critical violations that were cited because they are critical violations the school wont open if those violations are not addressed thats what were attempting to do now
2023844 the issue with the classrooms is that they want to accommodate all the students there is no issue on the closure the school is not closed but the classrooms need to be open so they can fill all the kids where they need to be and not if the school is overcrowded they may not open the school thats an issue but maybe it could be fixed today
2023845 i think gpss needs to have someone in their face holding their feet to the fire when theres a situation or a problem in the school especially dealing with health safety and sanitary conditions
2023846 we are very pleased to be able to join valeant in the creation of these three joint ventures

2023854 what weve found with miscanthus is that the amount of biomass generated each year would allow us to produce about 2 1 2 times the amount of ethanol we can produce per acre of corn
2023855 it wasnt that we didnt know how to grow switchgrass because the yields we obtained were actually equal to the best yields that had been obtained elsewhere with switchgrass
2023856 one reason why miscanthus yields more biomass than corn is that it produces green leaves about six weeks earlier in the growing season
2023857 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
2023858 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
2023859 keep in mind that when we consider our energy use a few hours of solar energy falling on the earth are equal to all the energy that people use over a whole year so you dont really need that high an efficiency to be able to capture that in plant material and make use of it as a biofuel source
2023860 our highest productivity is actually occurring in the south on the poorest soils in the state
2023861 so that also shows us that this type of crop may be very good for marginal land or land that is not even being used for crop production
2023862 in the context of global change thats important because it means that by producing a biofuel on that land youre taking carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the soil
2023863 keep in mind that this miscanthus is completely unimproved so if we were to do the sorts of things that weve managed to do with corn where weve increased its yield threefold over the last 50 years then its not unreal to think that we could use even less than 10 percent of the available agricultural land
2023864 and if you can actually grow it on non cropland that would be even better
2023865 dont let november 4 find you on the open road

2023884 according to the statement amounts totalling 3 945 billion were drawn from the fund by way of 138 advances as at 31 december 2006 forty nine of these advances totalling 1 721 billion remained outstanding
2023885 it did not re tender or obtain a new no objection from cabinet for the purchases of drugs and medical supplies further during 2006 amounts totalling 608 406m were expended on drugs and medical supplies however the corporation could not totally account for drugs and medical supplies purchased since there was no central point of accountability
2023886 subvention agencies not returning the unspent portions of amounts paid over to them for specific expenditure
2023887 several ministries and regions have not recovered amounts overpaid on various contracts in prior periods in addition some of these ministries and regions such as education amerindian affairs regions two three six seven and ten continued to have overpayments on various contracts during 2006 one such example was recorded under the ministry of education where 10 982m was overpaid on eleven projects which were mainly for the rehabilitation and extension to schools

2024025 blind men and women have been the motor of modern history and the source of endless misery and destruction aspiring leaders of great powers can neither understand nor admit the fact that their strategies are extremely dangerous because statecraft by its very nature always calculates the ability of a nations military and economic resources to overcome whatever challenges it confronts to reject such traditional reasoning and to question the value of conventional wisdom and react to international crises realistically on the basis of past failures would make them unsuited to command the result is that politicians succeed in terms of their personal careers states make monumental errors and people suffer the great nations of europe and japan put such illusions into practice repeatedly before 1945
2024026 i am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values

2024097 guitar hero on tour will appeal to a broad mix of players and as a result we wanted to use a number of different promotional devices to reach our target audience
2024098 i check gamesindustry biz every day you have to to know whats going on its definitely the best european news site and is beginning to offer a more global view too theres a ton of information and news on the net but this is the one that matters
2024099 i was a guerrilla for 16 years in the m 19 movement from 1974 to 1990 in 1990 we signed a peace agreement with the national government and we began our eighteen years of what you could call our legal political activity so ive been doing political work now for thirty four years
2024100 first there had been an electoral fraud in colombia taking place on april 19 of 1970 hence our name the movement of the 19 of april it was also a time of the guerrilla all over latin america a that point the sandinistas were still fighting in nicaragua as well as the fmln in el salvador in addition to all the older guerrillas from the 1950s and so at that time it seemed possible to bring about reforms by the use of arms especially when the electoral route to change seemed closed
2024101 i fought in the mountains was captured tortured freed and then almost murdered lost a leg and then negotiated a peace agreement with the government which we signed a year later in 1990 why did we sign the peace accord simply because we saw that armed struggle was going nowhere and we would never win even if we werent going to lose
2024102 in the mountains you can easily lose perspective for what youre doing
2024103 but we noticed that the conditions in colombian society were changing it was no longer the rural society of the 60s and 70s but an increasingly urban society and without the support of the majority of society we werent going to win we werent going to lose we could have maintained our positions but there wasnt enough support nor social conditions for a victory either and we knew conditions would simply deteriorate with time armed struggle is a method to achieve political victory and that method would no longer work to achieve a political victory so we signed the peace agreement and entered the legal political struggle
2024104 they still believe that even though conditions continue to deteriorate for them
2024105 ten years ago 1998 was their high point in terms of military strength capacity and results thats when they should have made peace it may be that they wont be defeated but their time for possible victory is completely gone now
2024106 if we had all signed peace agreements at the same time i feel sure we would be in a situation like el salvador with a strong left on the point of political victory
2024107 we the legal left continue paying the bill because their farc eln presence and activities continue to hurt the left working in electoral politics by affecting uninformed public opinion since the right wing continues to associate us with the farc and today the only way to transform society is through the electoral process
2024108 we signed the peace accord in spite of that slaughter of the up because we felt that by making a complete commitment to separate ourselves from armed struggle we would have some sort of guarantees of course some of our members were killed but we werent entirely eliminated nor were even the majority of us killed in general we were respected the situation of the up was quite different they had an element against them the guerrilla continued to be armed while people connected to that guerrilla tried to do electoral political work the simultaneous combination of two forms of struggle this is similar to other situations like eta and batasuna in spain or the ira and seinn fein at one time in ireland on the other hand we made a public commitment to legal process with zero connection to the armed struggle
2024109 difficult difficult but we won great support after the death of carlos pizzaro and were about a third of the national assembly playing a decisive role in the writing of the constitution and so that year 1990 1991 was a year of great hope but then it became very difficult we had nothing we had no money nor experience in electoral politics but the later development of the pdi came as the result of getting more experience and were all there in the pdi the demobilized m 19 the ex communist party the maoist left people from all sectors of the left were all there
2024110 it seems to me is too far to the right
2024111 well be dealing with this issue about whether or not to include the centrist parties in the pda i think what well end up with will be three distinct choices a right wing with uribe a center and a left alternative
2024112 i proposed that at one moment without considering the consequences of how it would be paid of the intermediaries and so forth
2024113 nearly all of latin america is pulling back from the idea of welfare programs we want to see people take part in their own lives and take initiative we dont want to make the people into beggars conceptual beggars waiting for manna from heaven and so were happy to finance productive enterprises with credits but theyre credits that have to be repaid and so they have to put in their part and make an effort everyone puts something in people may be very poor but they have to put something in well feed you lunch but you have to work for it and so they have to make an effort insofar as theyre able
2024114 here in nari o for instance were doing a sort of participatory budget working on developing communitarian enterprises and supporting rural workers campesinos indigenous and afro colombian groups and when there are struggles for land we side with the campesinos because we believe they have a right to land from my point of view the concept of democracy includes all this and its also more clear and direct
2024115 in the economy the state needs to offer support to the weak against the strong and even though its a bit out of style the state needs to work toward the redistribution of the means of production and so in this department nari o 70 percent of the campesinos have land an exceptional situation in colombia but the problem is theyre very weak and their parcels of land are small one hectare or half a hectare and so weve attempted to strengthen them by financial credits technical assistance and connecting them with other campesinos and all this is encompassed in the concept of democracy clearly whats needed is agrarian reform and this is also part of democracy
2024116 we want to see land given directly to the campesinos and not to cooperatives and associations what seems to work is technical assistance helping the campesino sell his or her products directly and without intermediaries but ensuring that the campesino is owner of his or her own piece of land because cooperatives might work well with the indigenous campesinos and even more or less with the afro colombians because there is a tradition of collective work among them but not with the other mestizo campesinos there its important for each family to have its own piece of land
2024117 were selling organic and fair trade products to europe where theres a big market for this sort of thing this is a great opportunity and especially now with the price of oil being so high to move toward organic methods of agriculture weve been developing those methods for example in the cultivation of coffee where were using both organic and commercial fertilizers after all this is a slow process this transition but were working on that organic methods and fair trade
2024118 all of this is oriented toward the establishment of food security but this is program what we call ethnodevelopment is new only developed in the past six months before then none of this existed
2024119 well theyre not very happy about this new governor here but neither have they opposed us so far weve maintained a constructive relationship based on an attitude of mutual respect working as best we can on the problems before us
2024120 for instance right now in two municipalities our department of nari o government is proposing to stop the aerial spraying of coca and voluntary substitution programs in two municipalities were proposing this to the national government as an experiment in which we would accompany and assist the two municipalities over a period of ten years were doing this because the spraying as a strategy has completely failed
2024121 the spraying is certainly cheaper than what i intend to propose but it has produced no results well see if they listen but im sure that well get better results than the spraying has done and besides my plan doesnt poison the earth
2024122 in municipalities where there is no coca production murders are at 20 per hundred thousand people and there are 21 municipalities where that number drops to zero where there is coca production that number rises to over 80 that is four times the number of homicides and more
2024123 because there is no food no freedom and the economy has collapsed
2024124 dont hit me im wounded the seriously injured were taken to a gaol hospital the rest to prison

2024133 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
2024134 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations
2024135 i am completely unaware that zionism ever aimed to rule the middle east zionism simply wanted to establish and maintain a miniscule jewish state in the land of israel palestine the patrimony of the jews conquered by savage muslim arab invaders
2024136 israel has been threatened by iran with destruction and the iranian nuclear project appears to have israel as its target
2024137 something like a cage has to be built for them there is no choice there is a wild animal there that has to be locked up in one way or another
2024138 barbarians who want to take our lives at the moment that society is in the state of being a serial killer it is a very sick society it should be treated the way we treat individuals who are serial killers
2024139 every intelligence agency in the world believes the iranian program is geared to making weapons not to the peaceful application of nuclear power
2024140 everyone knows that such measures economic sanctions have so far led nowhere and are unlikely to be applied
2024141 never advocated a genocidal attack on iran with the aim of killing 70 million iranians
2024142 irans leaders would do well to re think their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland
2024143 israeli nuclear threat morris has pre determined the result israel will have to engage in a genocidal nuclear assault on iran
2024144 i have or had another bad habit that of biting my fingernails that is even older and more deep rooted than my nicotine dependency

2024146 e coli has more than four thousand genes and the functions of one fourth of these remain unknown
2024147 much of what we know about other bacteria including the more dangerous ones like vibrio cholerae comes from our knowledge of e coli
2024148 this is a good sign for the possible replacement of the other three genes used to reprogram cells
2024149 ips cells hold great potential for future medicine but we must learn how to generate these cells in a manner that is safe for clinical therapies
2024150 this advance in reprogramming is one key step toward that goal
2024151 were not sure if the wnt molecule is doing the same thing as c myc or complementing activity
2024152 but it does increase stem cell growth similar to c myc
2024153 this is a good start toward using external cues instead of genetic manipulation to reprogram cells
2024154 but we still need to eliminate the need for retroviruses for the three other genes
2024155 is the same pathway acting in the human system and can wnt molecules be used to reprogram human cells
2024156 we dont know but i think those are very important questions to investigate
2024157 in earlier years breathing was synonymous with life itself for with the last breath its absence signified death and departure of the soul

2024164 theres no best practice or rule of thumb yet theres room for anyone to come in and become a dominant network
2024165 evolved in many ways we would not have predicted when we launched
2024166 when we appeared at demo and for the first several months we pursued a rather classic definition of a new type of site social media we found over the first several months from user feedback and users that the idea of having another profile another place for your identity beyond the main social networks was becoming burdensome users were feeling profile fatigue
2024167 we started to observe not just with peoplejam but also with other social media sites trying to drive connectivity around content and around lifestyle interests that we dont see any successes in the market
2024168 so we began to evolve the business to drive a different type of value proposition which is much more in the category of being a social utility weve developed to be a social utility for people interested in social improvement launched aug 4 as a component of our site that will be layered on top of the social media

2024174 its the first crowd powered search engine getting information based on what other people have been searching
2024175 the advertising model is the most popular but not necessarily the most desirable ads combined with premium or gated members seem to be best
2024176 i dont think you can be successful these days with less than two million unique visitors sessions per month
2024177 for a social media site depending on revenue from advertising anything less wont be successful and you dont start getting into powerful business models until youre well over five million uniques per month
2024178 the earlier information that we have had was that from the government in colombia was that yes one member of the team had worn such a bib but that this had only occurred during the operation and in an unplanned and unauthorized way so this obviously changes things somewhat and raises our level of concern which is why we have again asked the colombian authorities for further clarification
2024179 if there is a perception among combatants fighters etc that actually the red cross does not represent any longer a neutral humanitarian endeavor but possibly may be used by the enemy to win some sort of military advantage yes this could be a very concrete problem for us but also our colleagues of the national red cross societies who very often take considerable risks to be able to actually bring help to their people affected by war

2024207 appear to be repeating the early patterns of the epidemic
2024208 an enormous grassroots movement sparked government action and more significantly effective prevention campaigns
2024209 we have come full circle in the beginning gay men in places like san francisco and new york proved we could do prevention when we moved from that and started talking about the broad scope of the epidemic suddenly men who have sex with men became marginalized
2024210 prevention fatigue confidence in new antiretroviral drugs the use of methamphetamines and the arrival of a generation of young men who did not experience the ravages of the 1980s
2024211 the same kinds of stigma and discrimination and institutionalized homophobia that failed gay men in america is now failing msm in the rest of the world

2024732 mary blair is one of the most remarkable artists of our time and her work on
2024733 i would be sad to see the integrity unity and beauty of mary blairs inspired work of its a small world be broken to accommodate imagery that does not fit into her vision it would be like cutting scenes from say juno into to kill a mockingbird both great films but they just dont fit together in tone or look and would harm the vision of both van gogh into a rembrandt unthinkable its a small world is a beautiful piece of our history i hope and wish that it will be preserved and cherished as the work of art it is
2024734 the its a small world attraction is a genuine piece of american art created by a great american artist and to change it does a disservice to the artist and the fans who have been inspired by mrs blairs work in this culture of changing and updating everything to catch our shortening attention spans it is necessary to have a foundation that remains the same and stays constant for the positive growth of our culture i did not grow up in california and visited disneyland much later in my life going through the ride for the first time its charm transported me back to my childhood and made me feel nostalgic for what that wonder and innocence once was i am saddened that my children might never have that experience
2024735 like many people its a small world holds a special place in my heart it was the first attraction that my wife and i rode after i proposed to her and its joyful message of worldwide harmony shone especially bright that day
2024736 preserving something whether its a film a great painting or a great ride like its a small world assures that it can be enjoyed for generations the way it was originally intended to be enjoyed restoring a ride is one thing changing its meaning is another if i want to see disney characters i can always go to toontown go see a parade or go on one of many other rides which feature them let the park patron make the choice thats part of the fun of disneyland would you impose the country bears upon the indiana jones ride or sneak simba in on great moments with mr lincoln it would make as much sense
2024737 with all the uncertainty in the world today one of the few places a person could always escape both reality and hype no matter how brief was its a small world at disneyland i consider myself lucky to have been able to experience it as it was truly meant to be seen many times its plea to make the world a better place through the multinational voices of our future is something we need today more than ever lets hope better taste prevails and any hint of commercialism is avoided in the restoration of this truly great ride
2024738 mary blairs striking color innovative design and strong sense of whimsy have marked her as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century its a small world is a monument to both her talent and the vision of walt disney how bold to create an experience not dedicated to advertising a product but to encouraging acceptance and appreciation of our different cultures
2024739 im totally pissed about the disney character additions to small world but maybe ive grown to accept the gradual crapification of anything good about disneyland by people who care only about cross linking everything they own so that they each advertise each other this is just one more step closer to a disneyland boiled down to a series of billboard advertisements with a merchandise shop as the wiener at the end
2024740 ironically the phrase its a small world after all takes on a sad dark meaning in context to todays corporate culture it speaks directly to the character of those who run the show that is to say small small people of small small integrity running the entire world changing the ride as they intend to do with disney characters dominating the world perfectly represents everything for which the corporate world stands it may very well be an unintended work of modern art i say brilliant guys
2024741 i am one who thinks that the refurbishment of pirates of the caribbean
2024742 i grew up in flushing new york and at age nine had the opportunity to witness its a small world in its debut at the pepsi pavillion at the new york worlds fair
2024743 mary blairs work on small world is an artistic achievement of her unique sensibilities a symphony of color glitter cellophane and hope for the worlds children it should be maintained for future generations to enjoy and not compromised by additions vainly trying to blend in
2024744 im utterly appalled that a corporation as thoughtful and considerate as the walt disney company would actually consider welcoming those dirty little money grubbing rats into the hallowed sanctuary that is its a small world somebodys got to put their foot down before its too late
2024745 lets keep the original integrity of its a small world its refreshing to have rides that dont always pay homage to the disney characters it gives disneyland greater breadth and richness
2024746 with much of todays entertainment being driven by a pop cultural grab bag esthetic walt disneys small world has stood for over 40 years as a most refreshing oasis designer mary blairs brilliant creative vision is felt in every crevice and corner of the attraction to alter this vision by adding elements outside of blairs unique design sensibility would not only be a gross creative misstep but would also obscure the very spirit and message of the ride itself
2024747 disney needs to take a preservationist approach to historic works of art emblematic of walts vision for disneyland mary blairs design of small world is one of disneylands unique treasures and should be preserved in its entirety
2024748 although we recognize the practical necessity of updating attractions to keep disneyland commercially viable its a small world is a special circumstance for two reasons
2024749 walt disneys works sought to reconnect us with the spirit of youth despite differences of culture and geography we are all bonded by the laughter clarity and simplicity of a childs point of view this quality is not influenced by the whims and trends of a changing consumer society it is a constant it remains relevant the unique talents of mary blair marc davis rolly crump and others gave form and feeling to walts dream of harmony for future generations their uncompromised vision should be preserved at disneyland as a colorful legacy for our collective inner child both past and future

2024947 the only question is whether it is in our lifetime
2024948 the biggest surprise for me in the study was the fires following the earthquake
2024949 we estimate there will be 1 600 fires requiring the presence of at least one fire engine each we dont have that many fire engines in southern california
2024950 people call us fair weathered then tremble at the knees when the earth farts
2024951 maybe the quake will shake out all the guys from boston that transplanted here
2024952 no place on earth offers greater security to life and greater freedom from natural disasters than southern california
2024953 i think internet conversations are just reproducing pulp images of southern california
2024954 most people are not here for the thrills or an urban version of magic mountain
2024955 there is concern a few minor changes to the building code and then the politicians run away from the issue and the people go to sleep
2024956 we face seismic hazards we should be under no illusion that 20 000 dead is not an impossibility
2024957 its one of the most frightening apocalyptic things ive ever read
2024958 i couldnt get up because the ground had liquefied making the wood floor look like waves it was 4am and i thought i was having a flashback until the noise became deafening and the stench of snapping power lines filled the air then the walls began to crack i thought it was game over left the country some weeks later
2024959 our conclusion is that the earthquake we looked at isnt too bad
2024960 we can reduce a lot of the losses the question is will we have done enough that our economic system can get back together or will we have a katrina type situation where the economy cant get back because all the people have left
2024961 this is the first time that we have found a completely preserved chariot in bulgaria
2024962 even a quick look at the trailer tells you downey jr plays an actor who has surgery to turn himself african american one of the central jokes of the film
2024963 quite so it is literal minded to assume the makers of the film intended to belittle black people to mock them in this instance
2024964 yes but i think we can safely assume that robert downey jnr himself didnt have such plastic surgery for the role rather he blacked up which raises ethical questions

2025158 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
2025159 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
2025160 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
2025161 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
2025162 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
2025163 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
2025164 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
2025165 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
2025166 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
2025167 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
2025168 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
2025169 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
2025170 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
2025171 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
2025172 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
2025173 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
2025174 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
2025175 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
2025176 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
2025177 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
2025178 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
2025179 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
2025180 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
2025181 he must have been guilty because he was mentally ill
2025182 it is pretty apparent he dr nivins had psychological problems he may have been on the fringe where he was still able to function even if he did not function well
2025183 unique down to the wire presidential election hinging on swing voters
2025184 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
2025185 wir sind ein freiheitsliebendes land das in diesem augenblick angegriffen wird
2025186 wenn man sie die russen damit in georgien durchkommen l sst dann ist die welt in not
2025187 das ist wie der angriff auf afghanistan 1979 es ist wie damals in der tschechoslowakei als die sowjetischen panzer anrollten
2025188 man sieht wie gut der moment ausgew hlt wurde es sind olympische spiele niemand k mmert sich um politik
2025189 das ist wirklich ein brillianter zeitpunkt um ein kleines land anzugreifen
2025190 sie haben uns immer gesagt wir schlagen gegen euch zu weil ihr den vereinigten staaten nahe steht
2025191 wir beteiligen uns an vermittlungsbem hungen um einen waffenstillstand zu erreichen
2025192 wir fordern alle parteien georgier s dosseten und russen dringend auf zu einer deeskalation beizutragen und einen konflikt zu vermeiden
2025193 i have so many outrageous stories too many and im gonna tell em all
2025194 all the unexpurgated brain jangling tales of debauchery sex and drugs transcendence and chemical dependence you will ever want to hear
2025195 and this is not just my take this is the unbridled truth the in your face up close and prodigious tale of steven tyler straight from the horses lips
2025196 we played a gig at g a y and guess who he pulled points to dougie properly pulled
2025197 she introduced us on stage it was the last night so celebrities were there
2025198 there was paps there i didnt want many pictures so i tried to cover it up thinking it would be a kiss on the cheek
2025199 i didnt think shed want to kiss me and i thought shed kiss me on the lips and she proper went in i was grinning so she was probably licking my teeth it was a good kiss a very horny kiss

2025201 we have come to know that these kashmiri leaders have been included in the delegation therefore we doubt the integrity of this delegation since they are responsible for the present turmoil in the state
2025202 i call upon the people of jammu to maintain peace and communal harmony
2025203 why should we go out of the delegation who are they to dictate terms to us we are a part of this state
2025204 if they are willing to talk without us i have no problems to step out of the delegation
2025205 do you know ive been asked to leave they say i am too drunk to be here
2025206 i cant believe it this is so out of order i havent even been here 30 minutes yet
2025207 they allowed me to do all the television interviews and pose for pictures but now im being escorted out of the party
2025208 ive only had two glasses of wine before coming here but they are insisting ive had too much its ridiculous
2025209 is there ever a cafe or restaurant that simply astounds you with its awful service time and time again yet time and time again you masochistically continue to go there yeah thats what the

2025211 good calories bad calories challenging the conventional wisdom on diet weight control and disease
2025212 the worst people can say about us is that we use older studies
2025213 would you jump off a building because the law of gravity was discovered 300 years ago this is good science
2025214 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
2025215 weve got to sensitize people and weve got to get parents educated
2025216 while hes in our churches clapping his hands and tapping his feet hes the only senator who thought our kids shouldnt be allowed to pray in school
2025217 this strategy is the same as receiving a zero interest loan from social security
2025218 i expect us to receive higher combined benefits over the long run while protecting georgina if i die first
2025219 if he was two years since his arrest we would have some real evidence other than the statements made by mr khadr when he was in a dungeon in islamabad tortured for 17 days
2025220 nothing has really substantially changed since the last time he was up for bail
2025221 approximately 1 400 muslims worship at that institution every friday and because one person is alleged to have gone to afghanistan to be a fighter there does that then taint that whole place
2025222 that is a very dangerous biased and defamatory step to take
2025223 i was fortunate in that i felt comfortable talking about it with my doctors and my husband
2025224 but many women cant they push it down and bury it never to reclaim their sexuality again its very sad
2025225 for him it really wasnt the challenge it might have been
2025226 my husband understood that i would just be too tired sometimes but it also helped him to know that id get my energy back once i was done with the chemo and i did
2025227 we found a chemical reporter that detects a relatively rare event one that is related to the action of the toxin
2025228 our reporter probe shows that the reaction is taking place
2025229 when theres no toxin there will be no light emission
2025230 now that we have an assay that senses the toxins activity we can try to discover inhibitors of the toxin or antidotes
2025231 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
2025232 here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
2025233 the new information that the nphp4 gene can be involved in eye diseases only can shed light on the etiology of some low frequency eye diseases in people where similar mutations may be involved
2025234 at a time of economic hardship for so many americans we need to worry about american students
2025235 additionally starting this article out with a story of a white polish illegal is disingenous since the vast majority of illegals are not white sorry us news but that doesnt make the article or the subject more palatable we arent quite as stupid as you seem to think we are

2025237 gctex adalah alternatif terbaik bahan pewarna sintetik kerana ia berasaskan tumbuhan sepenuhnya serta dapat menghasilkan pelbagai warna menarik pada suhu berbeza iaitu di antara 60 darjah hingga 200 darjah
2025238 contohnya kulit bawang menghasilkan warna hijau gelap pada suhu 80 darjah hijau muda 100 darjah hijau keperangan 150 darjah serta perang 200 darjah

2025249 and i hope that you are able to be a father and a provider and a husband in the best sense of the word
2025250 the overriding problem is that the bush administration has said that hamdan will be held until the war on terror is over regardless of what sentence he gets

2025283 its clear that our health care system isnt giving americans the health care they need and deserve
2025284 i dont recommend that parents ever use home drug tests
2025285 if we had sought professional help earlier i think we would have had a better chance of preventing this outcome
2025286 my clinical experience tells me that parents are fooled all the time
2025287 we do it under controlled circumstances and we know the tricks of the trade
2025288 to know how this happens at the molecular level how things bounce skip spin tumble push and pull represents a big leap in our understanding
2025289 they dont want to break down it takes a long time for wood to rot it even takes termites a long time to break wood down and theyre pretty good at it ethanol producers face the same problem because of the way these molecules are arranged its difficult to get access to the reactive centers in wood and other biomass what we have done is to study some of the most basic reactions associated with the breakdown of these materials
2025290 small but significant step toward maximizing the efficiency of biomass utilization
2025291 we were studying little graphene trampolines and by complete accident we made a graphene sheet over a hole then we started studying it and saw that it was trapping gas inside
2025292 its amazing that something only an atom thick can be an impenetrable barrier you can have gas on one side and vacuum or liquid on the other and with a wall only one atom thick nothing would go through it
2025293 you could have instruments on one side of the membrane in vacuum or air and on the other side you would have dna or proteins suspended in liquid
2025294 and then you could get right up close to image the molecules within a few angstroms
2025295 once you have a membrane that wont let anything past the most interesting thing is to then poke a hole in it then you can detect what leaks through that hole with high sensitivity or make sure only what you want leaks through that hole
2025296 we need to build a better base thats more impenetrable such as single crystal silicon im confident we can make a leakproof version
2025297 to be more precise it will be 5 7 percent if the summer holds no inflation that means if the consumer price index doesnt budge for july august and september the benefit increase will be 6 1 percent if inflation runs at the 0 2 percent core rate for the same period and it will be more if inflation is higher than the core rate the last time there was a larger increase was 1982 when it clocked in at 7 4 percent
2025298 its beginning to look like the best way to get a good raise is to retire
2025299 it is unfortunate that we got out to good deliveries or loose shots weve been in this situation before at lords and we got out of it hopefully in the second innings we can dig deep
2025300 i am shocked about the muschany story and feel very sad for each of the families affected
2025301 i cannot comprehend such behavior it is intolerable if the cole county grand jury allegations are true muschany should be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of missouri law including prison
2025302 i am shocked about the muschany story and feel very sad for each of the families affected
2025303 i cannot comprehend such behavior it is intolerable if the cole county grand jury allegations are true muschany should be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of missouri law including prison
2025304 ive been resting it since hurting it at wimbledon for the purpose of being here and being able to do my best
2025305 for me its a thrill to be back no matter what happens its the olympics
2025306 developing an accurate model of ice would help architects civil engineers and environmental engineers understand what happens to structures and systems exposed to freezing conditions
2025307 it could also help us understand and better predict the movement of glaciers
2025308 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero
2025309 the original spin ice research went from one part of the periodic table to a more flexible one
2025310 but artificial spin ice goes off the periodic table altogether
2025311 it mimics the behavior of real ice but is completely designable with specific properties
2025312 we can change the strength of the spin or reformulate the alloy to change the magnetic properties which creates new bulk properties that we either couldnt get from normal materials or couldnt control at the atomic level
2025313 this is the first time the rules of ice behavior have ever been rigorously confirmed by directly counting pseudo hydrogen atoms
2025314 we can track the position and movement of each pseudo atom in our model see where defects occur in the lattice and simulate what happens over much longer periods of time
2025315 our meta material is very similar to patterned hard disk media magnetic bits used in hard drives are usually placed at random but memory density could be increased if they were in a tight regular pattern instead
2025316 weve found that both hydrogen in ice and the pseudo hydrogen in our artificial spin ice also behave as bits can carry information and interact with each other perhaps in the future engineers will be inspired by this in their hard drive designs the formal patterning and bit interactions may actually help to stabilize information ultimately leading to drives with much higher capacities
2025317 its going to be a great atmosphere for the first game
2025318 we have to play with that hunger and that desire in order to come out and be successful hopefully going into the first game we really come up to the plate early and try to make a statement about how were going to play throughout the tournament
2025319 by no means a situation where its going to be handed to us
2025320 weve got to go out and take it and were definitely going to be put to a challenge
2025321 everyones role is clearly defined when they come into the game they know they have to bring energy bring that hunger
2025322 obviously by what happened in oh four lebron d wade melo boozer are really doing a good job of showing that hunger and i think everybodys following their lead
2025323 but more importantly just go out there and play great defense try to knock down open shots obviously we have a lot of firepower on both ends and weve got guys that can play several positions so a lot of guys are interchangeable
2025324 i know people label me as a great defensive player
2025325 but a great defensive team will beat a great defensive player any day
2025326 we know that with the guys we have were not going to have a problem scoring so if the defense is there every night in case the offense slips then we still have a chance to win the ball game
2025327 the pick and roll is obviously the hardest to defend in any game whether its international or in the nba or in an oriental country
2025328 the good thing about it is we have guys like dwight and chris bosh who are quick and athletic than can be able to get up there
2025329 also we have guys on the weak side like deron and d wade and melo and those guys can be able to cover the basket while the bigs are away from the basket then again we have guys at the four spot that are able to switch or able to do different things in case we do get hurt i think thats one thing about this team is we have a lot of guys that are able to play different positions guard different players so if theres a certain situation where pick and rolls are hurting us we have different options

2025355 ich bin supersupergl cklich heute ist so ein supertoller tag endlich trage ich den namen meines mannes
2025356 wir wollten nur f r uns heiraten und haben uns gedacht dass wir uns ein sch nes datum aussuchen an das wir immer denken k nnen
2025357 da sind wir anfang des jahres auf den 08 08 gekommen
2025358 wir haben uns im mai verlobt aber alle denken wir heiraten erst n chstes jahr
2025359 wir gehen jetzt gleich zum fotografen und danach zur post und verschicken unsere vorbereiteten hochzeitsanzeigen
2025360 morgen kriegen dann unsere verwandten die einladungen f r unsere kirchliche hochzeit am 08 08 09
2025361 und wenn wir bei der post waren dann verschwinden wir zu dritt f r das wochenende auf die b hlerh he nach baden baden

2025366 das ist jetzt eine kriegsgeschichte das passt eigentlich nicht zu einem tag wie heute aber mein vater ist an einem 8 8 aus der kriegsgefangenschaft gekommen
2025367 da ist es sch n ruhig nach dem ganzen trubel den wir jetzt ja dann doch hatten
2025368 das kann man sich gut merken und dann kriegt man nie rger
2025369 und der 08 08 08 ist nat rlich auch ein sch nes datum
2025370 aber man kann ihn sich halt gut merken finde ich
2025371 wir gehen noch feiern und was essen und lassen es uns gut gehen
2025372 wir h tten auch am 07 07 07 heiraten k nnen
2025373 aber da waren wir noch nicht so weit und der 09 09 09 w r zu weit weg gewesen da ist es halt der 08 08 08 geworden

2025397 if we can understand how different sexual systems in plants have evolved we can then begin to understand how sex in general evolves
2025398 humans and other mammals generally have only two sexes males and females

2025400 i am going to continue to do whatever i can to help senator obama and democrats across the country win in the november elections
2025401 i have said repeatedly that i will do whatever senator obama asks me to do
2025402 this is senator obamas decision and his alone and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it

2025422 i had the realization that it wasnt about him at all that it ultimately ended up being about myself
2025423 i had taken this huge leap and put out my identity and sense of self worth and all of my savings to do this thing that most people thought i shouldnt do i had to prove to myself i had made the right decision
2025424 wow this is really a lot harder than i thought
2025425 this is what i had to go through and me yelling at you is no big deal
2025426 i was fortunate in that i felt comfortable talking about it with my doctors and my husband

2025428 dick cheney handpicked pawlenty as minnesotas next governor in 2001 learn about pawlentys ethics violations
2025429 crist has an impressive resume of questionable ethics and shady dealings just like his hero george bush

2025436 someone whos really being helpful and not cramming a marketing message down these kids throats
2025437 overall its become increasingly more important for nearly every position marketing in particular
2025438 ive got some more games to pitch and hopefully i can keep doing what ive been doing
2025439 im not going to try to change anything or invent something new im just trying to keep going out there and preparing and doing what ive been doing
2025440 tonight probably would have been enough to win any other night but not the way mussina was pitching
2025441 they love to maul and enjoy the hit and go so its going to be a typically physical argentina test

2025450 i didnt know caesar salad and lobsters are protected under the intellectual property laws
2025451 i understand the desire to protect intellectual property but sometimes it gets to be a little too mcdonalds y for me
2025452 food companies have been protecting their creations for a long time
2025453 but it has finally gotten to the level of restaurants because now with millions of dollars on the line the stakes are higher
2025454 recipe copyright is something people have only been thinking about for a few years so there really are no universal rules we can look at
2025455 substantial literary expression in the form of an explanation or directions
2025456 chefs think of themselves as artists so if other artists get copyright they think they should get it too
2025457 its tricky to establish how far you have to go to make your recipe unique
2025458 if i saut my garlic for three minutes and you saut yours for four is that enough
2025459 what can you add to it that makes it yours
2025460 you look at a lot of recipes to get ideas
2025461 and before you know it whoops you dont even remember that you saw it somewhere else
2025462 if you cant protect what you invent theres no incentive to invent
2025463 but the average chef isnt going to spend 600 every time he has a new dish
2025464 i understand that he wants to protect his intellectual property but it gets to be a little too mcdonalds y for me
2025465 its ridiculous to go to a lawyer before you sit down and talk with a chef
2025466 i know about your business now tell me who you are
2025467 i was released from the hospital in los angeles thursday morning worked on columns from my hotel room thursday and friday went to the movies clear and present danger thursday night flew back to washington sunday and was at work in my office monday august 14 one week after surgery
2025468 we figured out how to do it we can marry the needs of commerce and artistic beauty

2025471 our goal is to just collect taxes it is only as a last resort that we would pursue foreclosure
2025472 if someone says im dealing with a death were going to be reasonable and give them a 30 day extension
2025473 but 1 475 thats a lot of months mourning not to be insensitive
2025474 its very difficult to operate a small business in the county
2025475 resolved to continue concentrating on professional issues and avoid involvement in political issues
2025476 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2025477 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2025478 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2025479 i guess the redeem team is right we didnt do so well in 2004
2025480 we look for the opportunity to rekindling that flame and being the best in the world
2025481 we have more experienced guys and we have guys who understand and know what it takes to be an olympian and part of team usa i dont think we understood what it meant to put on a usa uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004 we definitely know that now
2025482 i dont think we were complacent we just didnt know what it took to be an olympian
2025483 watch us on sunday well show you what it takes
2025484 i was a throwaway on the 2004 olympic team because a lot of guys said no
2025485 i made this three year commitment to be a part of this and i know im going to be playing a big role on our side to win a gold medal
2025486 this means more than sitting at home and getting two more months of rest
2025487 it means more to me than playing for my respective team because im not just playing for a community im not just playing for cleveland akron or the state of ohio im playing for every state in america
2025488 we grew up thinking about the nba title but being an olympian is something i grew up never thinking about thats why at the beginning i never knew what it meant but now i do i think an olympic title and an nba title are equivalent to each other theyre both great
2025489 growing up you never think of any other league except for the nba
2025490 thats all ive seen but things are changing really fast you never know i cant throw all my eggs in one basket theres a lot of opportunities and there will be a lot of opportunities for me in 2010 if i want to stay with cleveland or if i want to go elsewhere could i ever imagine it no is it a possibility yes
2025491 firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs
2025492 the poor living out of sight and largely forgotten in some new kind of high rise projects beyond the city border with the wealthy huddled in gated enclaves in the center
2025493 if you werent already convinced that city life is becoming increasingly preferable to suburban life see this article
2025494 this already has happened in many cities like paris buenos aires tokyo dubai and london
2025495 m still not already convinced when oil crashes and gas prices come back to reality then what you think the very reason why suburban residents flee the city overpopulation will not get worse if they reverse course and come back
2025496 ey dont qualify for subsidies cant afford the new condos and find nys taxes and high prices to be suffocating these folks do need a car and want a place where they can park it these folks are leaving and that is not a good prospect
2025497 either by having a safer neighborhood or by having an asset they can sell or leverage for retirement purposes
2025498 st with respect to new york from the early 1960s to the late 1980s early 1990s will be an anomoly in my opinion
2025499 anyone walking down flatbush near the manhattan bridge will be shocked to see the amount of construction of luxury high rises both condo and rental plus hotels
2025500 the poor and immigrant communities also find ny atractive for other reasons alot of entry level service jobs
2025501 the one demographic that is declining in ny is the working and lower middle class
2025502 nyc is no longer attractive to these folks who are in a very different situation than those in brownstoner country they dont qualify for subsidies cant afford the new condos and find nys taxes and high prices to be suffocating
2025503 as the city gets more crowded and the burbs get cheaper e g nj real estate is going down much faster than nyc the burbs become more appealing
2025504 isnt it unconstitutional to take property rights from private landlords in the name of
2025505 but suburban living and home ownership continue to be heavily subsidized through the mortgage interest deduction cheap oil highway subsidies wars in the middle east free pollution rights school finance rules that allow self segregation to avoid paying for more expensive education and so on
2025506 when the shit hits the fan everyone and their mother is going to leave the city
2025507 we will not have any more crashes in our time
2025508 there may be a recession in stock prices but not anything in the nature of a crash
2025509 stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau i do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels such as bears have predicted i expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months
2025510 a serious depression seems improbable we expect recovery of business next spring with further improvement in the fall
2025511 irregular and conflicting movements of business should soon give way to a sustained recovery
2025512 all safe deposit boxes in banks or financial institutions have been sealed and may only be opened in the presence of an agent of the i r s
2025513 really cant happen again at least not at that scale no matter what the what says
2025514 just pay a visit to the outer reaches of brooklyn amp youll see there are plenty of areas being gentrified not by ex manhattanites but by brooklyn natives who are expanding their horizons beyond bay ridge dyker beach etc
2025515 contrary to borough and citywide trends flatlands canarsie witnessed a 12 7 increase in median income between 2002 and 2005 and the district now has the highest median income in brooklyn cd 218 also has a much higher rate of homeownership and a much lower share of rent regulated units than either the borough or the city
2025516 now in many of those areas you have a mix of working class and some professionals who stuck it out through the bad times along with new professionals moving in
2025517 the what i think you completely quoting me out of context shows why you are truly just an asshole and have no credibility even when you are right
2025518 like i said please of you believe this piece of bullshit then buy something you see most of you asshats are just fucking posers cannibalizing a whole neighborhood for gain you dont support the business here you just here for bullshit and have not made a investment if the hood like fucking locusts swarming from neighborhood to neighborhood
2025519 the two countries with the highest rate of growth in oil use are china and india whose combined populations account for a third of humanity in the next two decades chinas oil consumption is expected to grow at a rate of 7 5 per year and indias 5 5 compare to a 1 growth for the industrialized countries
2025520 the iea said china will be the main driver of demand across the asia region accounting for 48 9 pct of non organization for economic co operation and development asian demand by 2012 given the countrys booming economy oil product demand is projected to increase by 5 6 pct per year on average to almost 10 mln bpd by 2012 consolidating its position as the second largest oil consumer after the us it said
2025521 you dont even know any of the mom amp pop shops in bed stuy near restoration plaza so obviously you dont support the local businesses because if you did you would know them
2025522 and to repeat yet again you work ed in the real estate business you created the very problem you rant about if you want to be angry with someone look in the mirror
2025523 and no no one is going to beat me up
2025524 perhaps suburban housing costs are falling but transportation costs and taxes are high and growing if you work in manhattan the suburbs are no panacea both in terms of expense and time management besides there are plenty of run down areas in the suburbs whos to say the choice wont be 4 decent place in crappy suburban neighborhood
2025525 when this depression gets underway i want to see how many of you
2025526 i think however that the quality of construction in many suburbs will cause these developments to be replaced with higher quality construction a lot of these homes are going to fall apart in 50 years
2025527 nope everyone who bought a house from me did very well i got out just in time
2025528 would you like to wind up on the famous asshole quotes post

2025541 countries like australia have always relied on imgs to provide medical services particularly to rural and remote regions once a country has established the need to recruit an img because they are unable to secure the services of a domestic graduate it has an ethical responsibility to ensure that they encounter a fair system
2025542 arguably australia also has a moral obligation to utilise the expertise of its own img citizens and permanent residents first rather than draw on the precious medical manpower resources of other countries particularly those from the developing world
2025543 there is a lot of pressure on this age group from media and peers to look older act older dress older
2025544 but mentally and psychologically they are still immature compared to a 15 year old
2025545 our culture is that we want to be very careful about those pieces that we put on stage and we dont want to take that feel of the show away from the guests
2025546 static rules do not take into account all the environmental variables that affect signal degradation such as attenuation fading and interference
2025547 the communication range in a commercial building corridor is vastly different from that of a factory floor which is unlike a coal mine
2025548 toying with retirement calculators was so exquisitely painful and such a profound waste of time
2025549 what a waste of time the retirement calculator told me i had to save over 700 000 00 this year
2025550 we asked what if you could send a voice message with the same convenience

2025553 who the hell is that guy and how did he get there
2025554 when i got in the first thing my gran said to me when i got in to oxford was so am i going to see you in the boat race my grandparents lived through the war in the east end of london in a working class district they had really vivid fond memories of going down each year to watch the race and randomly picking a side to cheer on from the bank
2025555 i doubt it nan i said ive never been in a boat in my life
2025556 my nan was hugely proud when she stood on the battersea bridge watching it never in a million years did she think that this could happen i mean she was from the working class area of the east end she didnt even think people like that could get to oxbridge shes taped all the races and she still watches them once a week every sunday
2025557 theres a lot of dead time on the start line and an awful lot of noise not just the crowd but the other crews a lot of other nations go in for this caveman style grunting they slap their legs and growl so there are all these bizarre sounds coming over the water
2025558 i dont know whether its a reflection of our national character but us brits dont tend to go in for that
2025559 i dont do much talking here weve practiced it so that in the first 30 seconds or so i say very little some coxes yabber away yaddayadda but i dont think a rower can process all that so i just give one or two cues the team are expecting to hear bang we do that bang we do this
2025560 then from the sprint we manage the transition into racing pace thats when the contest really starts i look around and look at how were going the germans are up on us the australians are half a boat back and the dutch are a length ahead but theyll be soon be spent dont worry
2025561 into the race plan check the strokes 37 39 are we where we want to be if not then why a headwind then fine were still rowing well
2025562 the further down the track we go the less prescriptive we can be with our strategy we prepare for the final sprint are we defending a lead or are we trying to sprint through someone its my job to make the call then the push for the line
2025563 we use about 400 000 barrels of fuel oil per year and 18 months ago we bought it at around 40 per barrel
2025564 biomass is an attractive option but its hard to see how we can get there from here
2025565 when these things happen theres an increase in alcohol and drug use domestic violence a loss of retirement savings and higher healthcare costs that often get overlooked by people in washington who may see more drilling for domestic oil as the catch all solution
2025566 finding an alternative catalyst that will allow us to do oxygen evolution breaking the bonds of water or h2o and forming oxygen in concert with hydrogen
2025567 in a future hydrogen economy he imagines a house would function much like a leaf does using the sun to power household electricity and to break down water into fuel a sort of artificial photosynthesis
2025568 this years figures will be based on incomplete results because the government failed to ensure that the sats exam process ran smoothly and on time

2025575 we do not think that the amount of leakage would have any impact on humans or the environment
2025576 the united states assures strict procedures and prevention systems for nuclear powered warships coming into port and japan is also checking the radiation levels 24 hours a day
2025577 we are not charging anything for this and customers would just need to spend about 20 30 minutes at the dealerships
2025578 in order to encourage the democratization of the motherland to preserve the dignity of the constitution to protect the great motherland from the scheming of a handful of conspirators to prevent the bloodshed of 1 1 billion compatriots under a military reign of terror and to guarantee that millions of children are able to thrive in an atmosphere of freedom and democracy i swear until death to devote my life and my loyalty to defending the tian an men square the capital peking and the republic fight to the end against all adversity

2025582 though there were areas of overlap we found that common motivations for self benefit included interaction with the birds a sense of achievement social interaction personal stimulation and enjoyment
2025583 past research shows that people take part in wildlife activities for many reasons and so require a sophisticated level of management our findings reinforce that
2025584 though self satisfaction motivations were mentioned most often people also had many unselfish reasons for taking part in conservation including helping this vulnerable species preserving nature for future generations and serving the community
2025585 with declining budgets most wildlife agencies are not well equipped to manage the growing number of species at risk so they are depending more on volunteers to help with wildlife management operations

2025588 i was laying down saying i dont want to do this anymore
2025589 after the second surgery i wasnt in much pain but i was concerned i wouldnt be able to play football anymore
2025590 whenever i would try and get in a left handed stance i would fall because i wasnt that flexible
2025591 im just feeling good that i can finally play football at 100 percent theres no pain now i can have fun learn stuff and get yelled at for doing something wrong while im in a left handed stance i can do squats now i think ill be healthier stronger and just better all around
2025592 the trainers were telling me dont come back to the training room weve graduated you out of here
2025593 now weve got six guys that have played a lot of football it also gives you some options and you can move some people around if you need to
2025594 you cant practice the position without getting hit and how many times can you get double teamed by a pair of 300 pounders without it wearing you down
2025595 but im more interested in that girl down there you see im running against her
2025596 but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
2025597 its obviously an embarrassment and we would rather not be in this position
2025598 this sale is brought about as the present lord has been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer
2025599 for sale as a whole or in part can include david the existing eccentric lord of the manor physically as well to a suitable purchaser
2025600 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2025601 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2025602 a botanical superstar its there for a short time its glamorous its big it produces something special
2025603 george and mike thanks were starting to see some interesting patterns aside from the sheer
2025604 me thinks 2008 is bringing us the start of an
2025605 what did you have for dinner last night what about lunch what was the last book you read what are your favorite movies where do you like to eat
2025606 what are you doing hows your palate if i put a blindfold on you and have you taste five herbs can you name them do you really f ing want to do this without the mentality you can go to any school in the world and it wont matter
2025607 at cia i was trained under european chefs real chefs who would kick your ass and thats the way it was done
2025608 i trained under eugene boom boom bernard everyone in the program was afraid of him
2025609 i got my ass kicked learning the ability to cook correctly and thats the way it was done until little mary jane went to school and went crying to her parents that the chefs were yelling at her and mom and dad went and complained to the dean
2025610 it wasnt welcome here are your knives they broke us down
2025611 winning in beijing would mean as much to me as a wimbledon victory
2025612 meeting my girlfriend at the olympics eight years ago was definitely a highlight of my career
2025613 and carrying the flag in athens was a different highlight which was better well weve been together for eight years while the flag was only there for 10 minutes so i guess its her
2025614 tennis should be in the olympics but we have four major grand slams in a year for other athletes here it is almost do or die we will give it all we have got but in two weeks time there is the us open
2025615 the olympics needs to be the pinnacle of its sport
2025616 ive often thought rugby union missed a trick with the olympics
2025617 its not possible for me to stay there the olympic village there are so many athletes who would want their pictures taken with me i dont mind it but everyday i cant escape it
2025618 winning in beijing would mean as much to me as a wimbledon victory
2025619 many of our students are nontraditional or are career changers and are not in a position to do a 90 hour workweek
2025620 most people assume you go to a culinary program to be a chef and work in a kitchen thats a large part of it but the industry has grown and morphed
2025621 typically its in the low 30s for someone with an associates degree going into a kitchen
2025622 a bachelors would be leaving closer to the mid 30s but theyre in management tracks and in position to be promoted and moved around in a much faster time frame
2025623 the catholic community is still suspicious of the police to some degree
2025624 but there is a greater willingness among catholics to join the police
2025625 its created something of a vacuum for the dissidents to exploit
2025626 the time frame is that the benefit if there is any from screening is 10 years
2025627 the average life expectancy for men over 75 years is less than 10 years so screening them can do more harm than good
2025628 men over 75 should not be screened for prostate cancer
2025629 i told him he had two choices that he could go to school and spend a lot and learn a lot or that instead of going to school he could spend three years getting paid low wages and just work in kitchens and learn
2025630 if you walk into a kitchen and say i want to spend six months here as a prep cook i want to work hard and learn those of us in the business are grateful
2025631 if you want to be a doctor or a lawyer you kind of have to go to school but cooking is a trade im sorry but its a blue collar job
2025632 when i think about modern cooking school education ive got young kids getting out of school carrying 60 000 in debt and they come into my office and i tell them 9 50 to 10 an hour to start and theyre being told by cooking schools theyll start out making 15 an hour
2025633 i have had culinary students who have done well and those who didnt do well and ive had employees with no experience do well its all about individual personality
2025634 i look for passion whether theyve gone to school or not because then i know they will pay attention that their answer will always be yes chef
2025635 doing culinary education correctly is an expensive proposition and we believe you have to put in significant time you cant shorten the cycle
2025636 we have classes that purposefully put the student under a fair amount of stress and comprehensive exams that are very serious
2025637 anyway according to the enemy the streets in coventry smell of desperation so it could be worse
2025638 who then managed to cop three red cards in a single match in scotland
2025639 just that the ref only shows the red card for the first offence then takes a note of the subsequent ofences
2025640 also is there a dean windass biography around hes worth a tv series at least
2025641 but theres panic on the streets of carlisle dublin dundee humberside
2025642 welcome to yorkshire welcome to yorkshire welcome to yorkshire now f ck off
2025643 i am pleased with this decision bail i will proceed with my campaign
2025644 there is a risk that the political situation in malaysia deteriorates significantly in the coming weeks
2025645 there would be a great impact on the by election
2025646 the current trial is flawed it is not rape or assault as originally charged
2025647 only three goals were scored in three world cup games played in the olympic stadium the police contributed two own goals to the tournament first with insufficient protection for the chilean consulate which was attacked on 12 june then on saturday when demonstrators managed to exploit the berlin world cup final for political purposes
2025648 helps knit the bonds of peace between nations therefore may the olympic flame never expire
2025649 schmelings victory was not only sport it was a question of prestige for our race
2025650 uneasy about chinas human rights abuses and how they treat many minorities
2025651 i love the spirit of the olympics of bringing all the nations together on one platform
2025652 sport transcends ethnicity culture and religion and puts everyone on an equal footing
2025653 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
2025654 the youth of all countries periodically together for amicable trials of muscular strength and agility
2025655 its not like theatre or literature which are more elitist sport has a democratic aspect to it its so big so popular that political differences are bound to come into it
2025656 poetry painting and music used to be a vital part of the daily life of ordinary men as only sport can be now
2025657 at the time i was preparing lectures on durkheim who in relation to religion among australian aboriginals spoke of collective effervescence as i watched leicester play and the excitement grew inside the ground i realised what is this other than collective effervescence in this sense sport is religious
2025658 is used as a source of meaning and worth in their lives anything that provides the greatest meaning in a persons life has potentially become a religion for them
2025659 45 of adults and 87 of young people participate regularly in sport
2025660 8 of the population attend church sport is a pretty strategic place to start
2025661 first of all id like to thank people back home and the muslims around the world we gave our 100 per cent
2025662 this may be the first time a physical signature for a personality disorder has been identified
2025663 for the first time to my knowledge we have a specific brain association for people with a personality disorder
2025664 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
2025665 its not just a matter of bad attitudes or a lack of will
2025666 we have great strength in the area of personality disorders through our relationship with the menninger clinic
2025667 ive been resting it since hurting it at wimbledon for the purpose of being here and being able to do my best
2025668 for me its a thrill to be back no matter what happens its the olympics
2025669 had it been a cricket game held in any part of the world the interest and excitement from indians would have been fabulous but the scene with olympics is exactly opposite
2025670 this package is designed to give a first hand feel of the beijing olympics and travellers could then choose to customise it from us
2025671 we have not come up with any particular offer for the olympics as the response has been unimpressive in comparison we saw huge number of bookings during the cricket world cup travel bookings for formula one events which has been slowly gaining interest among indians has seen a rise people actually want to fly out to watch cricket even if it is for a couple of days but no such reactions for the beijing olympics
2025672 first ever worldwide mobile doodle in celebration of the summer games
2025673 the scheme would involve providing non plan assistance to these agencies subject to certain eligibility conditions and performance benchmarks the details of which are being worked out
2025674 these measures are aimed at increasing domestic availability and a consequent reduction in prices through improved supply management
2025675 google cares more about tracking users than they do about consumer safety
2025676 on further review it turns out this is not a bug but instead the expected behavior of this domain
2025677 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2025678 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2025679 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2025680 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can
2025681 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2025682 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2025683 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2025684 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2025685 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2025686 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can
2025687 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2025688 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2025689 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2025690 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2025691 its the early stages of fog if you were on a tropical island with the best air quality youd get that hazy appearance because of the humidity
2025692 i will say all those countries the americans the japanese the british that spent a lot of time talking about masks their athletes arent using them
2025693 the course is outside the city and i notice the pollution more in the city because my eyes sting
2025694 im convinced that this more of a haze than a smog because weve had no respiratory issues
2025695 if it was really bad smog especially when youre doing a hard workout if there was a problem with the air quality wed have respiratory problems
2025696 i dont know if its affecting my performance at all but i definitely feel dirty all the time and like i want to cough but i dont have to
2025697 the bottom line is and other countries have found the same thing there wasnt an impact on ventilation as a result of being here for a couple of weeks
2025698 its a much different situation long term there is higher incidence of cardiopulmonary disease and lung challenges for people who live here their whole life
2025699 weve kind of cased out those individuals we think might be at risk and for those individuals that show an exercise induced asthma we continue with lab testing and if its appropriate they end of getting a therapeutic use exemption for an inhaler
2025700 you start to feel a bit more tired earlier on in the game than you would maybe in another environment
2025701 its something both teams have to deal with so i dont think its going to necessarily change the game too much or the outcome of the game
2025702 weve actually had days where its been much clearer but the pollution count has been higher
2025703 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2025704 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2025705 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2025706 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2025707 from beginningless time the mind has never had any real existence
2025708 the federal aviation administration fined victoria osteen 3 000 for interfering with a crew member hardin told jurors victoria osteen paid the faa fine not because she was guilty but as a way to conclude the matter and avoid any embarrassment for her church
2025709 government programs once launched never disappear actually a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life well ever see on this earth
2025710 perry was only working at the behest of the cattle chicken industry anyway who are really the only ones hurt by higher corn prices
2025711 studies have shown that microbes can survive the shock levels of being launched into space
2025712 and as more and more organisms are discovered under extreme conditions its become more plausible that things could survive in space for the time it takes to go from one planet to another
2025713 the mccain campaign is determined to give their paris hilton ad a run for its money in the desperation department and they ve succeeded only in shining a light on the fact that the john mccain of today is unrecognizable from the john mccain of just a couple years ago
2025714 the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign the new john mccain supports the bush tax giveaways for the wealthy he once denounced opposes his own immigration bill flip flopped on torture and runs negative ads after calling for an honorable campaign
2025715 john mccain a maverick the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008 the american people are learning that the john mccain of 2008 represents more of the same failed policies weve gotten from george bush for the past eight years senator mccain is clearly in the tank for exxon and big oil for keeping our troops stuck in iraq for decades to come and for an economic policy that puts tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations above relief for hardworking families john mccain has changed hes taken the low road leveling false negative and misleading attacks against barack obama john mccain is no more a maverick within the republican party than dick cheney is hes just more of the same
2025716 the john mccain of 2008 is not the maverick of 2000 on the most urgent national security challenges we face iraq iran and al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan there is no day light between george bush and john mccain he has embraced president bushs failed policies and will continue them its unfortunate hes changed so much in just eight years
2025717 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
2025718 george and mike thanks were starting to see some interesting patterns aside from the sheer
2025719 me thinks 2008 is bringing us the start of an
2025720 it really surprised us to discover that it also showed the four year cycle of ancient greek games including the olympic games
2025721 oh i only got a hundred dollar bill hey lookit how big my room is its so much bigger than yours shows picture of room on cell phone look i got a plasma screen
2025722 beginning on august 5 2008 reports of mass emails claiming to be from the cnn
2025723 these emails have been circumventing spam filters and utilizing html based messages including the cnn web site logo and very enticing headlines to lure unsuspecting recipients into clicking on the links for news stories which are actually downloads of malware from various web sites
2025724 as the 2008 olympics will be starting friday august 8 we anticipate spammers phishers and other online attackers may use bogus
2025725 from beginningless time the mind has never had any real existence
2025726 il est donc difficile davoir une activit qui demande de la r flexion en tout cas cest dur pour moi
2025727 paris sest bien renforc marseille aussi je vais dire paris
2025728 dell to host global mobility event aug 12 in san francisco
2025729 clearly i am talking about a movement of moral reform
2025730 more organic food and recyclable shopping bags were demanded and customers were told what action was taken
2025731 religious conservatives are hoping a referendum on a montgomery county law protecting transgender people could become a template to repeal similar measures across the country
2025732 well of course i have to fight the situations unusual you cant expect people to treat me as human
2025733 they may be very good but we dont know what countries are they from what kind of training they have had
2025734 our canadian forces have been in the unfortunate position of not having any other option but of hitchhiking rides with allies or moving personnel in countries like afghanistan
2025735 these helicopters will mean less use of convoys to move and re supply our troops and bring humanitarian relief over dangerous terrain
2025736 we are going to save a lot of lives and directly affect combat operations
2025737 we dont need to tell the ground troops much they know 45 minutes in a helicopter beats one and a half days in a lav
2025738 it is terrible when a guy going home on r amp r gets blown up in a convoy we will fly him over that and help take an enormous part of the burden off a couple of helicopters flying what the convoys carry especially at night can greatly lower the risks
2025739 we dont have firm dates yet but the projected time frame is to begin bringing crews over by the end of the year for in theatre seasoning and to become operational early in the new year
2025740 the plan is for us to be there for six months at a time and to marry our rotations with our army rotations
2025741 since we have no chinook capability at home and all the chinooks will be in afghanistan everybody being trained is going to end up over there
2025742 what were getting here is exactly what the u s army pilots get
2025743 the chinook is much bigger and is designed to fly differently than a griffon
2025744 if you fly this helicopter like a griffon you can get into a lot of trouble so the first thing they try to do is try to break us of our old habits they have shown us ways they or others have made mistakes that were very costly
2025745 it sounds frightening but really it is no different than putting a helicopter down in snow
2025746 depending on the task at hand the chinook might be the best in the world it is a proven machine
2025747 it is currently the most capable battlefield transport helicopter in the world because of how fast it can go and how much it can lift
2025748 it is the only helicopter that can do all of this in heat or cold at high altitude
2025749 just for working in the arctic this helicopter is going to make a huge difference for canada
2025750 the range and fuel capacity means we can go places where we have not gone and with a speed and flexibility we dont have now
2025751 having tactical helicopters in afghanistan is essential and we have not been part of it they army has felt that and we have felt it too
2025752 men from the neighbourhood described by his aunts as were transformed into aristocrats of self mastery and brilliance at bat in cricket matches
2025753 at once collective and highly individualized tensions of men at bat
2025754 who saw the works of high bourgeois culture up to the watershed of 1848 as bourgeois societys legacy to the working class
2025755 which saw that legacy more in the modernist revolt against classical bourgeois culture
2025756 a new higher rationality for the organization of society that superseded the capitalist antagonism between work and leisure
2025757 capitals ceaseless striving towards the general form of wealth drives labor beyond the limits of its natural paltriness naturbed rftigkeit and thus creates the material elements for the development of the rich individuality which is as all sided in its production as in its consumption and whose labor also therefore no longer appears as labor but as the full development of activity itself
2025758 rich individuality as all sided in its production as in its consumption
2025759 different manifestations of the ultimately asocial ego of bourgeois society
2025760 the real individualism of collective social relations in work and in play
2025761 artistic forms external to the general social activity of the proletariat
2025762 rich individuality as all sided in its production as in its consumption
2025763 our findings have long term implications for how we teach negotiation
2025764 men who try to make a positive impression by being conciliatory risk forfeiting their own economic outcomes and women who try to make positive impressions by being assertive can risk damaging their relationships thus men and women may benefit from different strategies when it comes to balancing the tension in negotiation between empathy and assertiveness
2025765 con mi aportaci n le doto credibilidad al personaje ya que david gimeno est como un reba o de cabras y ese es un personaje que yo s interpretar perfectamente

2025767 hoy he vuelto a recordar el olor a carne quemada
2025768 with this study we looked at a very large population to determine how each individual could be stratified based on his or her dna
2025769 we want to see if the snps tied to a specific ancestry hold any biological significance to populations of different origins we want to see if the snps that we isolated are related to natural selection and adaptation for example to the weather conditions of different regions
2025770 because this method is purely computational and leverages linear algebraic methods such as principal components analysis without the use of information on self reported ancestry we were able to treat the data as a black box
2025771 much of the genetic variation was found to stretch between two points what we speculate is the northern european to southern european ancestry axis
2025772 i personally oppose the presidents power to sack the parliament and the government and believe it should be scrapped but i also oppose the presidents impeachment
2025773 made a hasty decision and they will be trapped in their own game
2025774 we are going to oppose it it is a half baked effort
2025775 the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against gen musharraf
2025776 songs that werent good enough to be on the album cobbled together with some remixes and field recordings of cardiffs indie scene
2025777 the original japanese version of neverland card battles was extremely well received and caught our attention as the best trading card game out there
2025778 we have enhanced and optimized ncb for the portable experience and will offer one of the finest card strategy games ever created for the psp this fall
2025779 we are honored to have a strong relationship with yukes company of america and serve as exclusive north american distributor of neverland card battles
2025780 theres a real realization that self reliance is going to be a key factor
2025781 what single symbol can we employ to irritate the chinese authorities without wearing protest clothing while leaving no room for an official backlash
2025782 can you please explain why some life should be valued while the lives of the weakest and most vulnerable are literally discarded
2025783 father joes blog is great fun to read too bad i will have to strike him dead with lightning some day
2025784 right after evening prayer i regularly read his blog and note corrections for my upcoming encyclicals
2025785 before i have my security council meeting each morning i check to see whats new at fr joes blog
2025786 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
2025787 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
2025788 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
2025789 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe
2025790 never have i met someone who was so opposed to true ecumenism and religious freedom i would like to sacrifice him in my dinner pot and wear his head as an ornament voices like his need to be silenced we should all pray and sup together
2025791 we consider that there is some materialisation of the risks that we have identified
2025792 most of the fall in euro dollar came from the extremely dovish comments from trichet in combination with gloomy data from the euro zone but growth is definitely a problem everywhere
2025793 when performing with tacs new illuminated drumsticks rock band drummers will literally be the highlight of the band
2025794 the incredible light effects of our illuminated drumsticks will be a hit for players and audiences alike the unique strike activated whole body led illumination provides mind blowing effects during intense flames and rolls
2025795 more precious than peace the cold war and the struggle for the third world
2025796 to infer that the soviet terror is as hideous as hitlerism is not only a brutal oversimplification but a moral indecency
2025797 when every nation in europe must have the chance to choose its own tomorrow free from the shadows of yesterday
2025798 when we reviewed the m883 last year we found it had real problems with image noise even at the lowest settings this is not the case with the m1033 noise levels are below average from iso 64 all the way up to 1600 the m1033s noise reduction system does well only adding a bit of detail loss or softness to the image at 800 and above i feel that iso 800 can still make large prints without any problems as long as it is a well lit image even 1600 has the potential to create a usable 8x10 or larger while there is also a 3200 settings there is still a lot of noise as well as detail loss due to the heavy nr i was very glad to see that kodak corrected this issue with great high iso performance on this new model
2025799 one of the things i talk to clients about is that the digital divide has changed
2025800 its no longer along racial lines like it was in 1996 and 2000 now its more economic and educational
2025801 a new generation of black activists is now focused on reforming institutions namely the congressional black caucus and the n
2025802 however most of us are not trying to reform the n
2025803 with rare exceptions such as the aftermath of katrina poverty and the poor seldom even appear on the evening news and when they do they are relegated mostly to merely speaking in platitudes about their hardships
2025804 d uring the more than three years studied there were just 58 stories about poverty on the three network newscasts including just 191 quoted sources
2025805 assuming that the nightly news still features a like number of sources per year that would amount to some 46 000 sources over the 38 months of fairs study making sources appearing in poverty stories just 0 4 percent of overall sources
2025806 in story after story poor people were included to tell generic stories of suffering before turning to experts who discussed what policies should be pursued to address the situation
2025807 cbs is the prime culprit having run segments on predatory lending 9 5 03 the difficulties of finding child care 11 25 03 and increasing economic polarization 12 8 05 that studiously avoided asking how government policies had helped to cause or failed to alleviate these problems the last one blamed the changing economy for increased economic polarization with no indication of what changes were made or who made them in late 2005 both cbs 11 24 05 and nbc 12 26 05 ran stories on food banks running short of donations without explaining or asking why
2025808 i clean 28 bathrooms a night i clean the principals office the lobby and a lot of other things in six hours
2025809 there is no extras its a struggle it really is
2025810 i went through a lot of gas in four days every four days we went through about a whole tank
2025811 cbs evening news with katie couric viewers were offered a discussion of the increasing need for food banks due to spiraling costs coupled with smaller pocketbooks
2025812 gas prices milk is just as much as gas these days its really hard im sorry
2025813 i think the best thing people can do is stand back and pray pray for better times
2025814 here at home people have a very high standard of living
2025815 e ven the poor have color television sets and pretty much everything they need
2025816 the soggiest cruise in yet but they still came in droves
2025817 for on that day we first created a lot of customers
2025818 it just popped up in front of me and i was like i never thought about it
2025819 ive seen boats houses cars anything you can think of i havent seen people yet but you never know
2025820 last time i bought eye glasses they were something like 300
2025821 youd have to pay someone a couple hundred bucks to do things yea its definitely worth it
2025822 it gives a black eye to collier county across the nation
2025823 board behavior is going to cause us to lose accreditation nothing else
2025824 i think this was another wakeup call and i think everybodys ready to come to the table
2025825 most absurd however is that geffen also claims that the delegation set out to try and improve the ties between the jewish and muslim communities in south africa i dont buy it they blame only israel for the problems they lecture only the jewish community about softening their positions they investigate only israeli abuses of palestinian human rights everyone knows about the importance of the perception of fairness in conflict resolution geffen knows this yet without any attempt to appear fair he has the audacity to claim that they wanted to improve relations between south african jews and muslims who is he trying to kid currying favour with one community and lecturing the other does not bring the two sides closer it polarises the communities it presses only the jewish community to change its views not through debate but through public pressure he calls on the jewish community to better understand the suffering of the palestinians here i have to agree but makes no similar demands of the muslim community furthermore geffens comparison between the positions adopted by the organs of the muslim community and the organs of the jewish community reflects complete naivet and ignorance in fact he describes the failures of the jewish community as far worse than those of the muslim community i challenge geffen to actually read what the organs of both communities say here nathan read this rhetoric from the muslim judicial council and then find me similar utterances from a local jewish communal institution
2025826 its an opportunity to vote cast their ballot in advance of the election on who they want for president of the united states
2025827 either mccain or barack they walk in they are handed whichever one they want and there we go
2025828 it was huge very big it was an idea that was created during an organizational meeting we did with all of our teams coming together
2025829 its all about the election drawing attention to it and how important the voting process is
2025830 we are now helping families who have never had to ask for assistance before in fact these are the very families who used to help us help others by donating their time and resources
2025831 this moral struggle is also a legal one and as such demands great resources
2025832 i started working and the cop asked me again if i seen anything or know anything
2025833 i said no she said if find any clothing or anything call us and let us know and i asked them what happened and they wouldnt tell us anything like that
2025834 orangeburg will be able to offer customers much more competitively priced power than they have now so those customers benefit

2025843 what we would like to present here could be described as the testimony of an era 1979 1983 in which a particular impulse encompassed not only new forms of musical expression springing forth from the punk and industrial waves but also a less pigeon holed approach to musical or non musical performances painting sculpture or the cinema the whole being removed from its usual frame and synergetically experienced outside the traditional consecrated places
2025844 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
2025845 i tried that two years ago and it didnt work
2025846 i support fair trade when we have regulations on our industry that make our products more expensive and other countries do not that is not fair trade all involvement in free trade agreements and involvement in intergovernmental organizations dedicated to trade must be for the purpose of achieving what is best for all americas i would repeal all trade agreements that hurt american workers and or weaken our economy and or penalize the american public i would withdraw from all intergovernmental organizations dedicated to trade that are not in the best interest of all americans
2025847 support pre emptive military strikes against countries deemed to be a threat to united states national security

2025868 our goal is to establish a mutually rewarding supply agreement with chrysler moving forward
2025869 however dana is prepared to exercise its right to discontinue supplying chrysler effective january 1 2009 if we continue to be unsuccessful in engaging them to address this goal in a meaningful way
2025870 serves to illustrate our commitment to pursue only market competitive business opportunities moving forward
2025871 this is a distinct kind of physical connection between two compartments in a cell the cytoplasm and the nucleus
2025872 it really opens up the possibility that there is a basic process going on that affects gene expression in ways that we had not understood before
2025873 the proteins act like players in a game of tug of war
2025874 they will move side to side in an ordered line remaining standing as long as the teams are of similar strengths however once one team pulls with a force that cannot be countered by the second team both teams fall to the ground in a jumble
2025875 given how difficult it is for a cell to activate just one gene activating 200 at the same time seems like a very difficult task
2025876 and the way the cell solves this challenge is through positive feedback it keeps all these events in sync
2025877 so what happens is that the very rapid ramp up of the g1 cyclins during start lead to all those target genes getting fired synchronously
2025878 its a function of positive feedback that hasnt been thought of before synchrony and coherence
2025879 it puts an enormous amount of pressure on chrysler its not like there are 200 other suppliers they could go to dana does have some level of bargaining power
2025880 we continue to explore opportunities to work with chrysler but have nothing to announce at this point
2025881 were going into critical decisions and it i think its important to have a full board
2025882 his spirits need to be good and off course he has physical challenges as you might imagine after what hes been through but i think he handled it well
2025883 we have an important meetings coming up and a tie vote means the issue failed so we need the odd numbers
2025884 when hes ready and able to make that decision to resign then thats when the board should act
2025885 theres a corporal who is supposed to double check and a sergeant that then double checks the corporals work neither did apparently
2025886 i think quite frankly he was irked with the total failure on part of the sheriffs office for whatever their procedure was it failed completely
2025887 we want to develop a system which would be more straightforward an arrestee should be declared either eligible or ineligible for bond not both the safety of the public is of paramount importance in this issue
2025888 i would answer back hard what do you mean hes not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
2025889 its barack obama who climbed up the hard way and thats why he wants middle class tax cuts and better schools for our kids
2025890 performing arts i believe is a way to generate creativity in young minds
2025891 hopefully itll touch a lot of peoples lives and make a big difference
2025892 its going to be an audio visual school which is paperless
2025893 i think the arts are actually a way of guaranteeing creativity and having students look forward to a wonderful wonderful life
2025894 i know people are going to look at it as he has absolutely no experience in that whatsoever but were pretty much into giving guys experience around here im reading beyond just his physical abilities i think this guy has the innards to close
2025895 does obamas sun in leo square to neptune make him an inspirational leader or self delusional
2025896 the obama phenomenon is the result of a country in despair he is not bringing hope he has capitalized on a deep fear and anger at the loss of an idea we had about what this country was supposed to be if obama had a track record and any proven leadership skills beyond gaming the system i might be able to get on board he does not if obama had not said almost the exact opposite of what his campaign has lead people to believe he believes i might be able to get on board if obama had not railed against lobbyists while taking boat loads of cash from the exact same gop bundlers as bush i might get on board but he has done nothing that speaks to any kind of internal integrity
2025897 the crux of this and many threads is simply who is barack obama we do know that he obama does not have a moral bearing based on his mercurial stances on subjects such as fisa and oil drilling the death penalty and gun control we do know that he was affiliated for 20 years with tony rezco a convicted felon that he lobbied for almansarrae for contracts in iraq that auchi the iraqi billionaire has been a distant supporter we do know that george soros the unrepentant nazi has supported obama we do know that he was a member of reverend wrights church for 20 years that his daughters and wife were members as well by mentioning just a few facts it is apparent that by what we do know there is the obvious need to pursue further what we do not know for what we do know is so very troubling
2025898 same here xoxo imo a band being on mtv has
2025899 jon omg its pete wentz ry how many times d
2025900 his message today is as important today as it was during his life on earth
2025901 he would talk only about the rosary and his relationship with mary
2025902 he was a striking presence and a very inspiring one
2025903 i was always in awe of him because he was so single minded and persuasive everyone thought he was a saint while he was still alive
2025904 i dont think customers care that much if the price moves slightly away from a dollar
2025905 look at me ive just pricked the skin and all this yellow gunk is squirting out
2025906 russell brand was gonna set about helping us to get signed a couple of months back and organised us to play privately at his house the band got a bit wasted afterwards and bass player amadeus de la fontaine had a piss on what turned out to be a ridiculous porcelain statue of a trout wearing pyjamas russell went psycho and he started lecturing us about how much things cost he told us the deal was off i stole a garden gnome on the way out
2025907 we snook the little bastard in inside a bass cab that we use to transport contraband shoes the goat was in the dressing room on his own for a good 20 minutes and chewed up a couple of russells frilly shirts shat in his pointy shoes and helped himself to some of his hair products it was fucking shitting all over the place russell was prancing around in a tizz complaining that one of his cravats was missing too it was marvellous
2025908 medusa got asked to play a gig in the back garden a friends birthday
2025909 later on he was in a gazebo entertaining people and put a colander on his head making people laugh especially us then he went off and cooked a ridiculous amount of food in the kitchen especially concentrating on the gravy wearing an apron and singing queens i want to break free he then poured gravy on the birthday cake we noticed ken doing a bit of old man dancing during the gig too me and our drummer paul brynes got kicked out shortly after for feeding the goldfish to the family dog
2025910 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr racine some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
2025911 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
2025912 the public debate surrounding this case showed that the medical ethical and legal consensuses on the legitimacy of the withdrawal of treatment in accordance to a patients will were challenged
2025913 this case is quite original because it reveals the emergence of a pro life social stream a trend that has now reached canada

2025923 i was informed by our colleagues in belgrade about the successful operation which resulted in the arrest of radovan karad i on behalf of the office of the prosecutor i would like to congratulate the serbian authorities especially the national security council serbias action team in charge of tracking fugitives and the office of the war crimes prosecutor on achieving this milestone in cooperation with the icty this is a very important day for the victims who have waited for this arrest for over a decade it is also an important day for international justice because it clearly demonstrates that nobody is beyond the reach of the law and that sooner or later all fugitives will be brought to justice

2025941 suffering is a sign that we have come so close to jesus on the cross that he can kiss us and that he can show that he is in love with us by giving us an opportunity to share in his passion
2025942 the cross therefore is always ready it awaits you everywhere no matter where you may go you cannot escape it for wherever you go you take yourself with you and shall always find yourself turn where you will above below without or within you will find a cross in everything and everywhere you must have patience if you would have peace within and merit an eternal crown if you carry the cross willingly it will carry and lead you to the desired goal where indeed there shall be no more suffering but here there shall be if you carry it unwillingly you create a burden for yourself and increase the load though still you have to bear it if you cast away one cross you will find another and perhaps a heavier one

2025945 honda insiders now dismiss earlier speculation that it might revive the insight name
2025946 is known inside the company as the new dedicated hybrid vehicle or simply the small hybrid
2025947 where the next prius is moving further upscale in size performance and price the honda hybrid is designed to be one of the most affordable gas electric models on the market priced from around 19 000 and delivering superior mileage as much as 60 mpg or better according to insiders
2025948 with hondas imminent release of a hybrid model rumored to start around 18 500 and therefore undercutting the price of the toyota prius a hybrid model from toyotas entry level scion brand could be in the offing
2025949 there are other stocks which recently beat estimates by wide margins and have not been rewarded such as the agricultural fertilizer sector and coal why because again in its illogical way of doing things wall street only rewards commodities if oil is going much higher
2025950 at times its like katy perry me and shwayze are kind of like the guinea pigs of the tour its like theyre trying to change the tour so its still a process but its definitely going really well im pleasantly surprised because i didnt know what to expect when i joined the tour
2025951 i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black
2025952 wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great
2025953 it was not surprising that the pentagons national defense university on the eve of the 2003 iraq war issued a paper declaring agribiz is to the united states what oil is to the middle east agribusiness had become a strategic weapon in the arsenal of the worlds only superpower
2025954 the clear strategy of monsanto dow dupont and the washington government backing them was to introduce the gmo seeds in every corner of the globe with priority on defenceless african and developing countries
2025955 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2025956 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs

2025961 we continue the transition of the jones soda co started in 2007 in what is described as a difficult economic period
2025962 we continue to learn and adjust our perspective and sharpen our tactics to increase sales and margin at the same time
2025963 our second quarter performance was highlighted by the ongoing rollout of 24c across north america through our dsd network and the relisting of multiple jones soda skus in a majority of target locations
2025964 in addition concentrate sales to national beverage increased 34 due primarily to shipments in preparation for the launch of jones cola jones sugar free cola and jones lemon lime
2025965 we also shipped our traditional flavours during the quarter we did experience some softness in our core bottle business during the second quarter but are pleased with bottle performance in key markets
2025966 while we are pleased with progress on many fronts we increased promotion allowances and slotting fees in order to support the new can presence and bolster the bottle business
2025967 this had a negative impact on our net sales and profitability we believe these key expenditures will result in greater awareness of our beverages and a stronger market position for our company
2025968 its not that the u s data has improved dramatically i think its that the economic picture is deteriorating dramatically elsewhere
2025969 the statement was fairly neutral in tone so those hawks who expected a future rate increase were disappointed
2025970 i cried when i got home and listened to suspicious minds over and over
2025971 truck demand will keep shrinking and the shift to small cars will accelerate
2025972 a higher percentage of credit losses in the u s as well as the increase in reserves for bad debt and residual value losses resulting from the decline of used car prices were the main reasons for the decreased profit
2025973 it will be crucial for us to act quickly and flexibly to overcome this

2025976 i would like people to see that he was the equal of paul and john though in the beatles he was often overshadowed and presented as the quiet one or the shy one
2025977 but i think he had every inch of the talent of paul and john
2025978 i sat with him for a few hours when he was in treatment he was about 10 days away but it was lovely and the years just stripped back we joked about things
2025979 as these managers unwound significant factor based portfolios these factors started to behave in unexpected and potentially troubling ways short names started to rally and long names started to fall as these trades started to hit the market as most quantitative managers use similar quantitative factors this abnormal factor phenomenon was not confined to a few funds rather a large number of quantitative managers have seen their models begin to behave in unexpected ways again it is no longer only the multi strategy managers but now pure quantitative equity managers who have started to see their portfolios misbehave both u s domestic and global fund managers

2026035 we are the ones we have been waiting for and the general reaction to it from the political pundits was that the ad was amusing that mocking obama for being messianic was a bit tough but that mostly this was evidence of the mccain campaign starting to take the gloves off

2026046 i am confident in a favorable outcome allowing the executive order to stand and i am hopeful judge hurst will render a decision on this matter as soon as possible
2026047 however no matter the outcome my staff has contingency plans in place that could be executed quickly to achieve the needed budget savings
2026048 agreeing with the request by judge hurst to delay the implementation of the executive order will not have a financial impact on the expected budget savings from the design plan changes in the agreement with council 94 the co share deductions will be deducted retroactively from the employees paychecks upon the courts decision
2026049 i remain convinced the actions that i am taking at this time are in the best interests of the people of rhode island are fair to all employees and are necessary to fulfill my constitutional and statutory responsibilities to balance the budget i want to again thank all of the employees who have opted to be part of the solution to the states fiscal difficulties agreeing to the terms of the new contract

2026131 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking that we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
2026132 weve got to do everything we can think of including reducing the size of the task by real conservation
2026133 that last task is very important because unless youve got lots and lots of vehicles with the better technology the impact is limited
2026134 the need to bring better technology into production and build up volume inevitably makes the time frames for technologies to make a difference long optimists want to move faster but its not clear we can really do it much faster

2026138 he said they are like that for a reason because mentally theyre suffering from what trauma they may have endured during the time they were there
2026139 he said it is always an honor to give a hug to a veteran because he was out there when we werent he put his life on the line for us when we didnt he also said he was very thankful that the riders came through his community

2026159 the chances of key local polls taking place in iraq this year all but vanished yesterday after parliament failed to pass a law on elections because of a row over the contested city of kirkuk which threatens to heighten arab kurdish tensions
2026160 the iraqi parliament speaker ended an emergency parliamentary session wednesday after the political blocs failed to reach an agreement over a disputed provincial election bill parliament speaker mahmoud al mashhadani said by the end of the 44th session on wednesday the parliament concluded its first legislative term and would resume sessions on sept 9
2026161 roughly half of the 48 billion dollar budget of 2008 approved earlier by the parliament
2026162 i can confirm to you that we have lost the chance to hold the elections in october
2026163 iraqi politicians officials and western diplomats have speculated that the political parties in government were never invested in holding a vote this year out of fear they would lose seats and influence at the provincial level senior politicians including president jalal talabani a kurd and vice president tariq hashimi a sunni arab have been absent from baghdad during the round the clock negotiations citing medical reasons
2026164 the elections would be the first provincial balloting in almost four years
2026165 i listened to many of them i noticed that most of them talk about kirkuk in a way as if its a prey for the greed and abmitions of their parties they never talk about it as a part of iraq because they dont care about iraq they care only about their limited personal interests
2026166 special inspector general for iraq reconstructions recent findings about how rich iraq is with oil money
2026167 yes its true that the iraqi government is spending little on reconstruction the weak iraqi capability to do big projects maybe at the end of 2008 will improve
2026168 signs of iraqs slowness to rebuild are everywhere in baghdad roughly 20 of the city is without proper sewage pipes published statistics say the baghdad is getting roughly 11 hours of electricity a day on average but many residents go days with only sporadic bursts of power iraqi officials say fixing just this problem could take up to 10 years chronic electricity shortages for another decade mean little energy for construction making iraqi hopes for a renewed capital seem distant
2026169 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2026170 this is projected and not real money we have many reconstruction projects and as you know most of the infrastruture of the country had collapsed after the war and that needs a lot of money to rebuild the country
2026171 as of december 31 2007 the iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of 29 4 billion held in the development fund for iraq and central government deposits at the central bank of iraq and iraqs commerical banks
2026172 from 2005 through 2007 the iraqi government generated an estimated 96 billion in cumulative revenues of which crude oil export sales accounted for about 90
2026173 with oil prices at or near all time highs it has become increasingly apparent that iraq is closer than ever to financial independence with the extreme property damage caused by an invasion of questionable legality the need for security and reconstruction monies is great but who should be held accountable many us taxpayers are becoming disenchanted due to the fact that with nearly 33 billion in oil earnings in the first half of 2008 iraq is now capable of shouldering an increased share of the burden our own economy is floundering and many simply feel that it is time for iraq to step up and assume control over its own destiny
2026174 two numbers 482 billion and 79 billion the first is next years projected federal budget deficit a record the second is the budget surplus that iraq is expected to accumulate by the end of the year is there any question which government whose taxpayers should be footing the bill for reconstruction projects in iraq
2026175 something is out of whack iraqis are very proud to say that its their country and they are right so they should fix it
2026176 many iraqis who lack adequate electricity clean water and jobs find it unfathomable their country is awash in oil dollars last year it spent less than a third of the 12 billion budgeted for major projects such as electricity housing and water
2026177 five star hotels parking garages a theater restaurant aquarium and basketball courts casino and boat rides but given the lagging basic services reporters questioned whether baghdads priorities are appropriate and realistic with temperatures hittign 130 degrees many parts of iraq dont have a steady electricity supply and some areas only get two hours a day getting clean water and adequate health care are also major issues
2026178 mahmoodd younis fathi was assassinated by gunmen in the city of mosul

2026180 you got two choices you stay home and not vote or if you want your vote to mean something and you want to be with the winner you vote for one of the two major party candidates otherwise you are wasting your vote
2026181 were those voters in the 19th century who spun off from the whigs and the democrats and didnt try to spin the difference between these two parties on slavery waste their vote
2026182 ive done surveys and polls all over the country heres my conclusion 15 of the republicans will vote for the republican nominee if the republican nominee was leon trotsky and 15 of the democrats would vote for the democratic nominee if the nominee was ayn rand

2026187 nader accuses the news media of being in a cultural rut by ignoring him he said hed been on national television only 10 seconds this election cycle put me in all the debates and well have a three way race
2026188 the media is in a cultural rut i am not talking about their private incisive skeptical conversations with one another i am talking about the questions they dont ask the questions they ask give me a bunch of 10 year olds instead of the white house press corps and the president would be far far more upset and anxious dont be so cynical about small starts if nature was like you seeds would never have a chance to sprout
2026189 the list includes nine chiefs of staffs two press secretaries and two directors of communications is that if its acucurate it shows that some of the religious rights favorite representatives and senators have gay staffers helping them advance their political careers and agendas
2026190 we sit by and watch the barbarian we tolerate him in the long stretches of peace we are not afraid we are tickled by his reverence his comic inversion of our old certitudes and our fixed creeds refreshes us we laugh but as we laugh we are watched by large and awful faces from beyond and on these faces there is no smile

2026194 since obamas short public career has been conventionally in some cases extremely liberal his tactical shift to the center has been startlingly obvious on issues from guns to terror surveillance to iraq and now reluctantly to oil drilling
2026195 obamas political calculation may be correct but it still involves a price it has shattered his claim to be different it calls into question his political character and leaves the impression he is consumed and defined by ambition

2026205 and in part because of last springs 168 billion stimulus the federal deficit will rise to nearly 500 billion next year almost three times fiscal 2007 levels
2026206 sad to say the current drill and burn campaign is getting some political traction according to one recent poll 69 percent of americans now favor expanded offshore drilling and 51 percent of them believe that removing restrictions on drilling would reduce gas prices within a year the headway republicans are making on this issue wont prevent democrats from expanding their majority in congress but it might limit their gains and could conceivably swing the presidential election where the polls show a much closer race

2026451 its these creatives who will be establishing the paradigm of the future
2026452 the problem is that increasingly the wealthy perceive whether correctly or incorrectly that they are under attack by their own government and they are taking the only rational option left open to them theyre taking their wealth and leaving

2026462 there are some indications that labor cost growth has been rising in recent quarters

2026464 there is very strong concern that price and wage setting behavior could add to inflationary pressure

2026468 but its just lego its just a toy youre taking this all way too seriously
2026469 what about a comic of a painting of a cartoon
2026470 one compact definition is that postmodernism rejects modernisms grand narratives of artistic direction eradicating the boundaries between high and low forms of art and disrupting genres conventions with collision collage and fragmentation postmodern art holds that all stances are unstable and insincere and therefore irony parody and humor are the only positions that cannot be overturned by critique or revision
2026471 postmodern art holds that all stances are unstable and insincere and therefore irony parody and humor are the only positions that cannot be overturned by critique or revision
2026472 soup cans benday dots from comic books and arranged geometric shapes
2026473 post postmodern by using a toy in such a skillful way that it transcends the original context of the medium itself
2026474 to convince the rest of the world that what we do is sometimes serious and worthy of their attention
2026475 content the creation has to express a message emotion etc
2026476 exposure is what we need just make it easier for people to see lego creations maybe encourage them to take more than a cursory glance appreciation will come naturally
2026477 so now i have to pretend to like graphic novels too
2026478 none have even doubted the fact that lego can become art after i posted my creations there
2026479 greatly restricted by certain factors such as physics ergonomics materials and the consumer market
2026480 its hard to draw the line between mocs that are art not art for a long time i was of the mind that there hadnt been any lego artworks created but rather that there was going to be ironically i think the breaking point was somewhere around the time when you posted the original document on classic space thats when we started to see some works that might be considered art or maybe rather collectively began to accept the notion that there might be lego art
2026481 i disagree with the notion that only the constructed cityscape was the artwork i think the actual community collaboration was the artwork
2026482 i think much of what you discuss touches on the good art bad art distinction instead of the art non art distinction is this roughly what you were getting at
2026483 im pretty sure i can build a better kings castle than that one
2026484 people in a deeper thought process about why they create and why with lego
2026485 what need is there to separate lego art from other forms of art
2026486 is lego art separate from other forms of art and if so how do we find out
2026487 what need 1 is there to separate lego art from other forms of art
2026488 all i ever really needed to know i learned in kindergarten
2026489 if we truly believe our lego creations have worth then we could simply showcase them to the world let them see teach them how to appreciate them the way we do using the developed framework mentioned above
2026490 i would argue that useful scientific development comes from explaining things where current theory is insufficient or incorrect
2026491 what need or gain is there to separate lego art from other forms of art
2026492 our current theory is empirically adequate it explains all the data why go looking for another theory
2026493 because there is an objective reality out there waiting to be discovered and even if empirically adequate our current theory might be mis describing it
2026494 oh i have a philosophy let me tell you about my half baked ideas of cosmic significance that i havent spent an hour thinking about seriously
2026495 in addition it is likely that this context will involve in some sense the idea that lego was originally a childrens toy and thus will involve our utilizing or subverting this origin in some way
2026496 gt by taking control of my finances i took back control of my life
2026497 what would happen if i save all these and never ever ever spent a penny of it
2026498 honey its impossible to save it all you need to spend money to survive youll see one day youll understand better when youre older

2026535 evolution is just a theory and should be critically considered
2026536 although intelligent children grasp religious concepts earlier they are also the first to doubt the truth of religion and intelligent students are much less likely to accept orthodox beliefs
2026537 there is a tendency for the more intelligent undergraduate to be sympathetic towards atheism
2026538 a slight tendency for intelligence and liberal attitudes to go together
2026539 little or no relationship between intelligence and attitude toward god

2026548 who supremely loved christ who desired greatly and strived to bring the gospel of christ to all peoples who for love of christ offered his life
2026549 lived and proclaimed the faith with tireless dedication and courage in the defence of integrity and purity he took advantage of every opportunity to make known the word of god and the thinking of the church
2026550 difficult years for the magisterium and for the governing of the church the years of protest and paul vi had to firmly steer the boats rudder and with courageous strength he strived to defend the deposit of the faith
2026551 difficult and painful he knew it would be opposed but he did not run from his responsibilities he had the issue studied and he studied it deeply and afterwards he had the courage to make a decision understanding well that he was going against the dominant culture and against what public opinion was expecting
2026552 the issue was one of divine law written by the creating hand of god in the very nature of the human person and the pope could not change it only interpret it
2026553 in a world wanting of love and full of problems and violence paul vi worked to bring about a civilization inspired in love in which solidarity and love reach to where social justice cannot
2026554 the civilization of love which should be raised up in hearts and consciences was for pope montini more than an idea or a project it was the guiding force of his entire life
2026555 may the virgin mary who paul vi tenderly loved and proclaimed mother of the church intercede so that the light of the teachings and witness of paul vi continue to illuminate the journey of the church and of society

2026560 what will be even sadder is when mitch is sitting alone in his carmel home the morning of wednesday nov 5 reading the newspaper and the headline says
2026561 i remember hearing the joke about the iraqi soldiers eating nivea thinking its yogurt
2026562 men should never ride bicycles riding should be banned and outlawed its the most irrational form of exercise i could ever bring to discussion
2026563 no nose saddles are a useful intervention for bicycling police officers alleviating pressure to the groin and improving penis health different saddle designs may require some re learning of how to ride a bicycle but the health benefits to having unrestricted vascular flow to and from the penis and less penile numbness is self evident
2026564 for the first time we have a prospective study of healthy policemen riding bikes on the job using wider no nose bike saddles for 6 months not only did their sensation improve their erectile function also improved changing saddles changed physiology this is a landmark study for our field that that is important for future riders and modification of lifestyle showing improvement without any active treatment
2026565 the only physician designed anatomic saddle that provides essential pelvic floor relief conforms to your body shape and moves with you while you ride for women men and children
2026566 the ultimate bike seat for women ridden and universally loved around the world for 14 years terry has been designing and testing saddles with female athletes distance riders and recreational cyclists introduced in 1999 the italian made butterfly represents the best in all that research and development wider in the rear than typical race saddles for good support of a womans sit bones completely cut away through the nose and mid section making it flexible and comfortable against soft tissues low profile flat top with multi density injection molded foam thats a bit stiffer in the rear for more power while pedaling
2026567 in 1997 the design of body geometry saddles was said to be a marketing ploy to sell saddles we knew this wasnt the case but couldnt prove it
2026568 we used to think it took an hour for a cyclist to lose blood flow we now know it takes about 60 seconds
2026569 pleasure riders and commuters will be pleased to know that spiderflex bike components has put the fun back into bike riding with a new saddle design that is both ergonomic and comfortable this bicycle seat smooths out those rough trails and pot holes that your body wants to forget the saddles unique patented ergonomic design features durable all weather polyurethane seat pads a high grade polished stainless steel frame and a heavy duty suspension system for long comfortable rides
2026570 has been clinically shown to increase blood and oxygen supply to the genitals by an average of four times over a traditional tear drop shaped bicycle seat design while riding in an aero drop bar position
2026571 excessive amounts of padding or gel can create pressure on the sensitive nerves and arteries in the perineal area this is because excessively soft and thick material moves to the areas of least resistance when it is compressed creating uncomfortable compression and friction where it is wanted least
2026572 just enough padding to ensure a high level of comfort without exhibiting any negative characteristics commonly found on highly padded saddles
2026573 i am about to release the second edition of my book finding the perfect bicycle seat i re wrote much of it and added a lot of current research about womens saddles as well as noseless saddles i also added many more pictures to explain the concepts better and have all of the most recent research articles included
2026574 at the heart of the comfort saddle is the patented rq8 suspension system which moves specifically to match the natural sway of the pelvis torsion bar elements absorb shock loads and make the saddle self centring the suspension does not require you to balance on the horn of a bicycle seat so the comfort saddle has no horn it can take you over any terrain without risking damage to those parts of your body normally defended by your pelvis that conventional horned saddles are so perfectly designed to defeat
2026575 we had the saddle tested in the 90 60 and 30 degree positions
2026576 our saddle is different from all the others and it has been my experience that proper set up and positioning is critical to the level of comfort obtained i cant help but wonder if we might have had better results if i had been present for the testing to insure that the test rider was seated on the saddle in the correct manner i have found that a number of riders are sitting to far back on the saddle and are not achieving the high levels of comfort that they should be i am receiving e mails from all over the world about the lack of pressure on the perineum and the high levels of comfort riders are experiencing while riding the adamo racing saddle
2026577 we have done our homework on this design and while it may not be for everyone it eliminates pressure on soft tissue areas which for men is the prostate and the pubic symphasis that all the plumbing goes under on the way to your genitals and for women is the perineum where all their genitalia is
2026578 we suggest riders get a bike fit by professionals and that they raise their handlebars and extend their cabling to compensate for the lack of a nose on the saddle the problems we address are not going to go away and we think that we provide an intelligent alternative
2026579 the adjustability of our saddle lets riders find what surface positions works for them
2026580 our claim to have solved the century old problem of bike seat soreness may appear somewhat trite to the bike industry but to the broad mass of consumers it will have a considerable impact when it lives up to the promise
2026581 when you solve a problem that has been around for over a century you dont find the answers easily or do it overnight
2026582 in fact we made the same mistake as most other bikeseat designers by thinking we would solve the age old problem of bikeseat soreness just by designing a better bikeseat
2026583 then we set about marketing the seat only to learn that the seat was just one part of solving the problem although initial test marketing of the seat drew very good reaction from some consumers the overall feedback showed us that there wasnt even one bicycle on the market that automatically placed the rider in the right position to gain full benefit
2026584 all of them claim to be original or ground breaking and many of the product owners invited me to get involved with their products but i have never seen a product before that really provides everything it promises the stylyx bicycle is truly revolutionary and flies in the face of a bike industry that has not listened to what the everyday bike rider is looking for comfort healthy support and easier pedaling its hard to understand why solving the seat soreness problem and making bicycles really comfortable was never approached like this before
2026585 suspended seating surface is 100 percent open to the air which allows moisture to be wicked away from the body
2026586 nothing presently available offers a genuinely more comfortable alternative until now that is
2026587 a very specific combination of radial and straight contoured planes which redistributes the downward pressure of the riders weight away from the perineum and onto the gluteus maximus buttocks providing a new and unrivalled level of improved cycling comfort with a completely free pedalling action
2026588 technological manufacturing revolution specially developed to fulfil the saddles requisite combination of localised flexibility and rigidity and doing away with the need for any superfluous upholstery
2026589 prevent the pelvic organs and genitals getting squashed and rubbed
2026590 in bikers that cover long distances we observed an increase of erectile dysfunctions of the penis
2026591 there are two theories from an etiopathogenic point of view
2026592 these authors have proved that to protect penis blood perfusion the important factor is not so much the extent of the saddle padding as its width
2026593 a saddle with these characteristics however is not suitable to professional bikers the aim of our work has been to identify a product that had the characteristics to preserve penis blood perfusion and at the same time had a geometrical design compatible with the bikers requirements the smp saddle seems to possess many of these requirements because it has a seat that is uniformly distributed over the gluteal muscles the ischial tuberosity and the ischium and it keeps the perineal plane free furthermore the saddle beak made which has an eagle beak shape leaves the outside genitalia free from compression
2026594 increased contact surface area 12 more than standard saddles for better pressure distribution
2026595 solves the support area problem by providing a larger surface
2026596 the manta saddle is an alternative to a fundamentally flawed component in an otherwise sublime and extremely efficient machine
2026597 whilst increased area has been used in other saddle designs it has not been achieved without compromising stability or comfort in most cases it has in fact caused more mechanical problems for the rider the manta saddle follows the natural movement of the riders legs using the principal of levers much the same as in the human body this allows the support area to extend beyond the small area around the base of the ischial bones almost as far down the legs as a normal office chair
2026598 one absolutely should not put pressure in the area that the saddle nose inhabits
2026599 common sense dictates that to put all body weight on such a small and soft arterially significant few sq cm is not a good thing
2026600 it has been tested with a harmless soft nose just to give it some of the old feel of conventional saddles i prefer it without
2026601 most women have reservations when testing the saddle due to the shape however after trying a correctly installed and setup saddle have purchased due to superior support and ultimate comfort
2026602 the first example of a new industrial invention based on the articulated oscillating saddle base
2026603 helps cyclists keep to the rear of the saddle unlike harder and stiffer saddles which generally cause them to slide forward
2026604 is more stable thanks to the excellent quality and workmanship of the cove promotes a totally natural and non critical position in the area supporting the ischiatic bones the impact of which on the saddle is almost totally neutral accompanies the pushing leg better during pedalling and improves the transmission of force improves pedal strokes while the leg is rising
2026605 attenuates body saddle separation and or jolting improves shifting of the lower dead centre position of the pedal thus accelerating that of the upper dead centre position transmits driving force more rapidly and directly improves the continuity of prolonged effort and improves performance and energy exploitation

2026640 that is why i support extending fully equal rights and benefits to same sex couples under both state and federal law that is why i support repealing the defense of marriage act and the dont ask dont tell policy and the passage of laws to protect lgbt americans from hate crimes and employment discrimination
2026641 extending fully equal rights and benefits to same sex couples under both state and federal law
2026642 the passage of laws to protect lgbt americans from hate crimes and employment discrimination
2026643 the divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the california constitution and similar efforts to amend the u s constitution or those of other states
2026644 finally i want to congratulate all of you who have shown your love for each other by getting married these last few weeks
2026645 as your president i will use the bully pulpit to urge states to treat same sex couples with full equality in their family and adoption laws
2026646 i personally believe that civil unions represent the best way to secure that equal treatment but i also believe that the federal government should not stand in the way of states that want to decide on their own how best to pursue equality for gay and lesbian couples whether that means a domestic partnership a civil union or a civil marriage
2026647 this is the first time that you have had a major presidential candidate voicing his support for same sex marriage
2026648 this letter is congratulating those who have gotten married despite the fact that he has said in the past that he opposes same sex marriage so to me this is clear support for same sex marriage
2026649 repeal of doma has been a mainstay of the democratic leadership in congress since they took over
2026650 nancy pelosi supports it of course barney frank does both barack obama and hillary clinton said this when they debated at the logo debate in the primary here though he is crossing the line and saying that he supports same sex marriage
2026651 im going to fight for same sex couples oppose doma as president oppose efforts to stop the redefinition of marriage and press for adoption for homosexual couples
2026652 you didnt get john kerry saying anything like that in his statement concerning same sex marriage in 2004 this really is the first time that you have a presidential candidate who has pledged to fight for all of these issues
2026653 barack obama in the past has been unclear about whether he supports same sex marriage i think this statement sews up any loose ends
2026654 theres no question that he is now the first presidential candidate to come out in support of same sex marriage
2026655 he essentially has bought the homosexual agenda hook line and sinker and has promised to push it whole heartedly to use the full weight of the office of the presidency to push the homosexual activist wish list
2026656 he has whole heartedly stepped behind the notion of same sex marriage homosexual adoption enda the employment nondiscrimination act hate crimes legislation all of these things that if they were implanted would take away religious liberties and freedom of speech and the traditional values upon which our nation was founded
2026657 i am pleased that sen obama continues to articulate a vision for families in this country that promotes fairness and equality
2026658 i think it is important that all families regardless of how they were created have the protections they need in order to make sure their children grow healthy and strong
2026659 touch base with you as soon as we have an update
2026660 the church rejoices and is proud of the vast majority of her priests who are good and extremely praiseworthy
2026661 she knows and explicitly recognizes that the vast majority of our priests despite their human weaknesses and limits are decent priests who give their lives every day to the kingdom of god who love jesus christ and the people entrusted to them they are priests who are sanctified in the daily exercise of their ministry who persevere until the end in the harvest of the lord
2026662 its true there is a small percentage of priests who go astray sometimes gravely but the church desires to repair the evil they have done
2026663 in the regions and environments where the christian faith was preached centuries ago
2026664 it is a mission or missionary evangelization within our own flock meant for those who we baptized but for different reasons we did not sufficiently evangelize or who lost their initial fervor and went astray
2026665 is relativistic secularized and agnostic also has a strong erosive effect on the religious faith of many
2026666 the church by nature is missionary the church knows that she cannot stay at home and limit herself to welcoming and evangelizing those who seek her in their communities and parishes
2026667 it is essential we get up and go in search in the places where people and families reside live and work all members of the ecclesial community pastors religious and the laity are called to this mission
2026668 when priests are on the move the church is on the move
2026669 otherwise it would be very difficult to carry out the mission you beloved brothers are the great treasure the dynamism the pastoral and missionary inspiration at the foundation where our baptized live in community
2026670 but lord if i dont have to do it i really dont want to i am tired
2026671 oh yeah thats when i am not experiencing him either
2026672 get the hell off the computer and talk to people
2026673 veal 1 the initial extraction of flavor from bones and aromatics to obtain a first liquid
2026674 veal 2 or remouillage remoistening the second extraction of flavor to obtain a second liquid
2026675 by re flex and then i have that frakkin song in my head all day so of course i had to listen to re flex while i cooked and then thought hey maybe i should also listen to
2026676 sure you can in theory get grass fed veal but for a very high price and you certainly have to special order it
2026677 i didnt know elle macpherson was the one writing this blog how clever of her to use the pen name carol blymire
2026678 the comparisons make it sound like beef stock is awful
2026679 honey these little bunnies are so flea ridden and miserable they run up to you and beg to be shot
2026680 veal by definition is the product of a sick anemic deliberately malnourished calf a newborn dragged away from his mother in the first hours of life
2026681 i know who i am and im totally fine with who that is
2026682 the problem was identified and fixed the error did not change the outcome
2026683 nearly all large broker and many bank intermediaries currently outsource the proxy material distribution function for beneficial security holders to
2026684 the complexity of the custodial ownership system combined with the pressure of numerous shareholder votes creates a system that is far more complex and fragile than the one anticipated by the delaware legal most of these companies are subject to the sec proxy rules when they solicit proxies
2026685 it seems like the people who say this are convinced that such kerfuffles only and could only happen amongst women but i have to say believing that mostly means one has internalized the sexist messaging that terms disagreements between women as catfights but between men as vigorous debate
2026686 i think that playgirl had it listened to some much needed advice since ive been part of their pages could have been something beautiful there is so much potential for a magazine that appeals to women and men who like looking at men and reading about women but for some reason in the united states we cant seem to execute the formula of naked men intelligent sexual conversation interesting topics that appeal to women happy magazine
2026687 and the misconceptions dont end there the obvious media assumption is that girls who charge the most per hour make the most money although ive had several high class escort friends comment that their route is not the way to make the most money and if they wanted to make more they would charge less charge less yes let me school those of you who dont know on why that is
2026688 theres a supposition in that statement that one distinct event affects our life decisions that statement is at best a narrow way of looking at our life choices
2026689 i find it very important to recognize differences in the situations of people involved in sex work when it comes to outreach why because face it point blank end of story the needs of a person in the sex industry who is there by choice or who is an adult or who does have an education or who is not addicted to drugs or who hasnt been or is not currently being abused are going to be vastly different than the needs of someone who has any or many of those things going on in their lives those needs have to be assessed and dealt with on a person by person basis so recognizing the differences between people is vital
2026690 to ironside women are reduced to nothing more than our number of partners not our sexual comfort level sexual satisfaction or any other indicator of sexual health and happiness its the number not the people informing that number that matters that tally becomes the sum total of our sex life regardless of what we got out of it
2026691 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok
2026692 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated
2026693 you can only do your very best more than that does not exist
2026694 love is giving to others at the expense of yourself lust is giving to yourself at the expense of others

2026703 n ot all international law obligations automatically constitute binding federal law enforceable in the united state courts
2026704 the judgments of an international tribunal a higher status than that enjoyed by many of our most fundamental constitutional protections
2026705 why not the analysis of a question similar to the one we confront contained in an opinion of the supreme court of canada the constitutional court of south africa the german constitutional court or the european court of human rights
2026706 completely idiotic idea that leads to nothing but party disharmony
2026707 its been a tradition since the late 1800s its a nominating convention you vote you nominate someone and you come out unified i dont see how alienating 1 800 delegates gives you party unity when we walk out of the stadium

2026713 this is a cost effective means for forest managers to generate management plans and manipulate geospatial information when theyre in the planning process
2026714 gerema features a user friendly interface it is a dynamic open ended system that allows users to easily build and manage specialized information related to planning reports
2026715 this software helps forestry students concentrate on the development of the actual forest management plan rather than spending considerable time on the mechanics of entering data and producing supporting materials
2026716 we are very appreciative of the tremendous and enthusiastic technical support that we have received from the ccs staff
2026717 this generous and much appreciated donation is a reflection of lakeheads ongoing relationships with valued industry partners like buchanan forest products

2026720 seventy pages of fluff isnt going to help the tens of thousands of manufacturing workers who have lost their jobs since dalton mcguinty came to office this so called report is an insult to the workers who lost their jobs its no wonder there were no photo ops when this report came out
2026721 the so called strategy outlined in the report suggests that a marketing strategy is the solution to ontarios manufacturing woes maybe david ramsay should have consulted with the workers getting the pink slips they know all too well that real economic policies create jobs not gimmicky marketing campaigns
2026722 that this council is in the unique position to stop throwing money at the problem and instead welcome our citizens back downtown by providing two hour free metered parking
2026723 and for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
2026724 while it isnt every day that a human is violently attacked and eaten by another human its worth noting that it is the norm for many people not to give any thought to the fact that restaurants are serving flesh that comes from innocents who were minding their own business before someone came after them with a knife
2026725 to stress this very point peta will be running an ad in the portage daily graphic comparing the similarities between this gruesome bus butchering and the acts of cruelty and killing performed every day by the meat industry
2026726 we see parallels between acts of violence against humans and cruelty to animals since both spring from a common root we understand that such comparisons may be uncomfortable for many people but theyre not inaccurate
2026727 i think of one of the hymns come from darkness into light and its exactly what this diocese has done
2026728 i mean weve had a lot of negative stuff in the past and its amazing where weve come from to where we are today and the journey that weve experienced its just great
2026729 t he choice of a pro abortion catholic running mate would amount to scratching at a deep and festering wound in the american catholic church
2026730 i do think there has been some success in reaching those people
2026731 at the same time i dont think many voters are fooled when push comes to shove the reality is there has been effectively no change of position on the issues that i think many of these voters care most about and that is protecting life protecting marriage and promoting religion in our public life
2026732 i wont sugarcoat it this will be the hardest thing you ever do
2026733 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homo phobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
2026734 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean

2026749 coincide with the reservations expressed by peru about this term at the international conferences of cairo and beijing
2026750 it is not exactly known who created the concept of reproductive health and how
2026751 the concept of reproductive health is becoming accepted by leaders politicians and doctors without any basis or further questioning
2026752 other intentions are hidden under the umbrella of reproductive health
2026753 such as forced sterilizations the hiding of information about the abortifacient nature and side effects of some contraceptives the arguing that pregnancy begins with the implantation of the fertilized egg and not a conception for example in order to approve the morning after pill and the passage of heath care laws that prevent doctors from having recourse to conscientious objection
2026754 sexual rights reproductive rights sexual health the legalization of abortion gender gender perspective sexual diversity homosexual marriage and emergency contraception
2026755 in order to give social and legal legitimacy to the idea of reproductive health

2026771 regardless of todays verdict hamdans trial revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law
2026772 hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention only to face a process that falls far short so far the trial continues the bush administrations efforts to escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice
2026773 we have consistently called for justice and security to be pursued within a framework of strict adherence to international law however the us government has systematically failed in this regard
2026774 stoning is a horrific practice designed to increase the suffering of those facing execution and it has no place in the modern world
2026775 we look to the iranian authorities to ensure that this dreadful punishment is never again used
2026776 if this announcement holds it will represent a signal victory for iranian human rights defenders who recently mounted their own stop stoning forever campaign and a big step forward for human rights
2026777 now we need to see further action by the iranian authorities to end other cruel and inhuman punishments such as flogging and the amputation of limbs as well as other steps to reduce use of the death penalty

2026784 i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black
2026785 microscopy is undergoing a great revolution now because of modern optics and spectroscopy
2026786 there are many exciting new approaches and this is one of them
2026787 because we can build the microscope very compactly we can imagine building an entire system that is the size of an ipod
2026788 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
2026789 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
2026790 keep in mind that this miscanthus is completely unimproved so if we were to do the sorts of things that weve managed to do with corn where weve increased its yield threefold over the last 50 years then its not unreal to think that we could use even less than 10 percent of the available agricultural land
2026791 and if you can actually grow it on non cropland that would be even better
2026792 our highest productivity is actually occurring in the south on the poorest soils in the state
2026793 so that also shows us that this type of crop may be very good for marginal land or land that is not even being used for crop production
2026794 in the context of global change thats important because it means that by producing a biofuel on that land youre taking carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the soil
2026795 one reason why miscanthus yields more biomass than corn is that it produces green leaves about six weeks earlier in the growing season
2026796 so we can walk around sydney and show the baby our town
2026797 shes tiny shes not a doll shes a like a real little thing just dont photograph right in her face or in our faces because its scary for her shes tiny a tiny little thing

2026801 sarah beth dursts into the wild is fabulous in the oldest truest and best sense of the word harking back to fables wonder and magic unleashed its bold sassy and utterly engaging i cant wait to see what she does next
2026802 into the wilds fairy tale characters are fascinating and julie is everything one could want in a heroine shes intelligent practical determined and brave at once more ordinary and more extraordinary than she herself thinks she is ill be keeping an eye out for more work from sarah beth durst
2026803 an amazing wild ride with very high stakes and the fate of humans and fairytale people alike on the shoulders of one determined girl this is even better than the first book
2026804 this is one of those rare occasions when the sequel is as good as the first book if not better though in my estimation they make two halves of one story and what a wonderfully entertaining story it is
2026805 head spinning fun any book that mixes fire breathing dragons and elvis presley is a rare treat
2026806 look at them flying above our gridlock in vehicles we were mocking when they were proposed as an everyman system but now that it is only the rich that have it i want to bitch and complain that i should get it too my lack of vision will lead me to complain about it after i see them flying overhead while i am stuck in ground traffic

2026839 the execution of jos ernesto medell n rojas by the state of texas is a violation of international law
2026840 it undermines the authority of the international court of justice icj which had ruled in favour of a stay of execution
2026841 irremediably in violation of international law and break our treaty promises
2026842 not executed unless and until these five mexican nationals receive review and reconsideration
2026843 constitutes an international law obligation on the part of the united states
2026844 ten years ago the government used a similar charge of sodomy against anwar ibrahim and kept him in jail for six years the conviction was ultimately overturned
2026845 in 1998 amnesty international considered anwar ibrahim a prisoner of conscience today there are again indications that the government is not playing by the rules in this case
2026846 we are also concerned about the safety of all the witnesses in this case particularly dr mohamed osman and we call on the government to provide adequate protection to them
2026847 its fair for the malaysian people and the international community to judge the malaysian governments respect for the rule of law based on how they proceed with this case
2026848 stoning is a horrific practice designed to increase the suffering of those facing execution and it has no place in the modern world
2026849 we look to the iranian authorities to ensure that this dreadful punishment is never again used
2026850 if this announcement holds it will represent a signal victory for iranian human rights defenders who recently mounted their own stop stoning forever campaign
2026851 now we need to see further action by the iranian authorities to end other cruel and inhuman punishments such as flogging and the amputation of limbs as well as other steps to reduce use of the death penalty
2026852 arbitrary blocking and unblocking of certain sites does not fulfil the duty to comply with international standards of freedom of information and expression
2026853 like the rest of the world chinese citizens have a right to access information and to express themselves on line on all areas of legitimate public inquiry including human rights we continue to urge the authorities to ensure unfettered access to the internet in line with official olympic promises of complete media freedom and international human rights standards
2026854 irremediably in violation of international law and break our treaty promises
2026855 the execution of jos ernesto medell n rojas by the state of texas is a violation of international law
2026856 it undermines the authority of the international court of justice icj which had ruled in favour of a stay of execution

2026901 we recognize the oppositions against the content of the agreement even the process by which it was carried out but to put forward arguments based on misconceptions about islam and derogatory statements about the moro people is uncalled for especially from a statesman such as the honorable representative
2026902 the moro people is not what he called new minted citizens sir we have been a civilized people long before the spaniards came we were a sovereign nation 448 years before the philippines even became one we had a defined land territory and we are not solely seafarers as mentioned perhaps the good congressman forgot manila started as a muslim community ruled by rajah sulayman
2026903 as a moro i found solace against the injustices perpetrated by this administration against my people in the cause of the opposition for rights and justice but now their statements appear to be inconsiderate of the bangsamoro struggle i am left with the realization that there is indeed no space for the moro people in philippine democracy either with the administration or with the opposition i only hope that they refrain from making comments about an issue that they have no adequate knowledge about

2026949 due to the increased level of extremist activity targeting individuals involved in biomedical research in recent months our first concern is for our employees and the animals we care for at charles river
2026950 usda did open an inquiry when we filed a complaint
2026951 their statement about fears for their own safety is absurd

2026962 we have heard a great deal this year about the need for change
2026963 but at the same time we are told that one thing cannot change namely the abortion regime of roe vs wade
2026964 it is time that we demand real change and real change means the end of roe vs wade
2026965 abortion is different abortion is the killing of the innocent on a massive scale
2026966 it is time to put away the arguments of political spin masters that only serve to justify abortion killing
2026967 end the political manipulation of catholic voters by abortion advocates
2026968 it is time to stop creating excuses for pro abortion candidates catholics should no longer be asked to be partners in the abortion regime by voting for politicians who support abortion
2026969 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who defend and support a culture of death
2026970 it is time that catholics shine a bright line of separation between themselves and all those politicians of every political party who defend the abortion regime of roe vs wade
2026971 imagine if this year millions of catholic voters simply said no no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion
2026972 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us

2027001 nigerias university system used to be the finest in west africa but todays classes are overcrowded buildings are crumbling and the curriculum has remained unchanged for years
2027002 the situation is particularly bad in port harcourt the capital of rivers state the countrys wealthiest and the centre of the oil industry
2027003 m ilitary leaders of the 1980s and 1990s saw the groups growing membership as a chance to confront the leftist student unions often aligned with pro democracy movements
2027004 as their strength grew the cults influence on the universities became more malign
2027005 some progress has been made in tackling the cults at the rivers state university of science and technology thanks to 200 odd security officers covert surveillance and student informants for the first time in over a decade there were no gunshots on the campus last year
2027006 after several months of reprieve port harcourt city rivers state lost its peace once again as rival cult groups engaged themselves in a free for all that left eight dead
2027007 the renewed clash between two warring groups allegedly led by soboma george and farah dogogo left residents of the oil city scampering for safety
2027008 the fighting according to report started around npa dock yard extended to njemanze borokiri nembe waterfronts and other parts of the state capital the cultists were said to have freely detonated dynamites and engaged themselves with sophisticated weapons of war
2027009 the rival gangs are led by sogboma george and prince farah who are wanted by the rivers state government for kidnapping and involvement in other criminal activities police spokeswoman rita abbey said
2027010 the seven detained bahai believers have confessed to setting up an illegal organization in iran that took orders from israel and others to undermine the islamic system
2027011 we deny in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that bahais in iran have engaged in any subversive activity
2027012 the bahai community is not involved in political affairs their only crime is the practice of their religion
2027013 the seriousness of the allegations makes us fear for the lives of these seven individuals
2027014 we deny in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that bahais in iran have engaged in any subversive activity
2027015 the bahai community is not involved in political affairs their only crime is the practice of their religion
2027016 the seriousness of the allegations makes us fear for the lives of these seven individuals
2027017 that is no secret the government knew perfectly well about the existence of this committee long before its members were arrested just as the government knows perfectly well that these people are not involved in any underhanded activity
2027018 suggestions of collusion with the state of israel are categorically false and misleading the iranian authorities are playing on the fact that the bahai world administrative center is located in northern israel
2027019 the iranian government completely ignores the well known historical fact that the bahai faith was centered in iran until 1853 when the authorities there banished the bahai prophet founder who was forced into exile and eventually imprisoned in acre on the mediterranean coast under the ottoman turkish regime that area happens to be in what is now israel
2027020 i have trouble with this issue i always tend to bring to much but if i had to choose only three items first and most important is an exacto or other trimmer ruler and adhesive
2027021 understanding and minimizing quality deterioration is critical for manufacturers as it is a key driver of owner satisfaction and word of mouth recommendations
2027022 it is imperative that manufacturers design models that not only achieve high levels of initial quality but also attain high levels of longer term dependability vehicle models that stand the test of time will help automaker profitability through superior owner satisfaction and recommendation rates
2027023 although automakers have achieved tremendous gains in initial quality and dependability in recent years by specifically addressing customer concerns these particular problems still prove challenging for manufacturers
2027024 the fact that these problems have endured throughout the industry for many years suggests that additional focus on these issues prior to vehicle launch would benefit not only consumers but also automakers through increased customer satisfaction
2027025 the gains in dependability for compact and midsize vehicles are good news for consumers who are downsizing their vehicles due to increasing fuel prices
2027026 consumers who purchase these smaller vehicles benefit not only from immediate gains in fuel economy but also from improvements in long term dependability compared with previous years

2027035 i am not talking about their private incisive skeptical conversations with one another i am talking about the questions they dont ask the questions they ask give me a bunch of 10 year olds instead of the white house press corps and the president would be far far more upset and anxious
2027036 dont be so cynical about small starts if nature was like you seeds would never have a chance to sprout
2027037 i define winning in many ways that are acceptable to political scholars
2027038 one is you keep the agendas alive there is a generation of americans who couldnt even argue the progressive income tax much less the estate tax which has been renamed so you keep the progressive agenda alive you bring a lot of young people in a lot of not so young people get a little morale boost
2027039 we wont know who the winner is until the votes are counted
2027040 its august the election is in november youre deciding the election for the people based on who you are covering
2027041 are you trying to telling me that you can call the november election today is that how powerful you are or how knowing
2027042 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2027043 after weeks of late night negotiations and under intense u s pressure iraqi lawmakers failed to pass a much debated provincial elections law wednesday before adjourning for the month the failure to pass the law which would govern elections in provinces across the country may push the elections into next year if elections dont happen by the end of this year it could be july before the balloting could be carried out u n spokesman said arikat said
2027044 a special session of parliament sometime during the recess which ends sept 9
2027045 days of intense negotiations and heavy pressure from the u s the united nations and britain
2027046 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a local elections law
2027047 its interesting what i find interesting about this report as well is when youre looking at these two countries iraq and afghanistan seeing how vastly different iraq is from afghanistan in terms of the natural resources that they have afghanistan is a very poor country one of the poorest in the world iraq will come back much faster given that they had some semblance of infrastructure as crumbling as it was but something to work from afghanistan is being built from scratch and so i thought that was something worth taking away
2027048 i saw the report i saw the reports about the report so id refer you back to the state department just to as they wake up this moring just to make sure that theyve looked at it because i dont know all the details
2027049 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
2027050 weve done a lot for the iraqis just in terms of the numbers themselves
2027051 ill tell you what concerns me and most of my constituents you said many times the gains in iraq are fragile and reversable so my constituents and i believe that
2027052 you have to wonder why the best that you can say is that the gains are fragile and reversable
2027053 and i listened carefully to senator hagel and ambassador crocker from the answer you gave him i dont get the
2027054 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
2027055 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
2027056 iraqs oil income will more than double this year baghdad continues to spend only a small percentage of its own money on reconstruction and services while it banks billions in surplus funds
2027057 between 2005 and 2007 only 10 percent of iraqs expenditures went toward reconstruction with just 1 percent spent on maintaining u s and iraqi funded investments in roads water electricity and weapons according to a report released yesterday by the government accountability office even when baghdad has allocated larger sums the report said it has spent only a small portion of the budgeted money
2027058 left little doubt that iraq which racked up 32 9 billion in oil earnings from january through june can afford to pay more for its own reconstruction
2027059 driving through iraq you feel the neglect here in basra the city is rivers of sewage destroyed buildings and bridges from war after war after war every day i pass by the same buildings destroyed years ago during the u s led invasion in my neighborhood in baghdad every day they look exactly the same a pile of rubble the electricity problem seems to be getting worse iraqis have an average of about four hours of electricity a day while there is talk of reconstruction a bridge here flowers planted there the people dont feel a change
2027060 one thing thats very important is how they are spending their money which is distributing it evenly amongst the around the country but amongst the different sects as well so shias sunnis and kurds its something that theyre going to have to continue to work out we want them to take on more of their own responsibilities just from a security standpoint but also reconstruction also if you remember prime minister maliki went into sadr city basra and mosul he offered immediate financial assistance to people who were living there under those terrible conditions

2027149 communism is a good theory that just hasnt worked out well yet
2027150 communism and the law of consecration are basically the same thing
2027151 the law of consecration is a celestial law not an economic experiment

2027320 csa week 5 the journal entry that didnt make the paper
2027321 gardening question of the day for saturday july 12 2008
2027322 reformed theology ascribes to the christian life a unique degree of devotion to the interests and the glory of god the believer does not merely desire to have intercourse relationship with god but specifically to make this intercourse relationship subservient to glorifying god hence on the one hand the high place which the direct worship of god holds in the exercise of the religious function on the other hand the consistent effort to organize the whole of life on the principle of a comprehensive service of god the religious impulse imparting to every human activity and achievement that spirit by which they are made to redound to the honoring of gods name
2027323 reformed theology has with greater earnestness than any other type of christian doctrine upheld the principles of the absoluteness and unchanging identity of truth it is the most anti pragmatic of all forms of christian teaching
2027324 but the reformed have always insisted upon it that at no point shall a recognition of the historical delivery and apprehension of truth be permitted to degenerate into a relativity of truth
2027325 it is an unchristian and an unbiblical procedure to make development superior to revelation instead of revelation superior to development to accept belief and tendencies as true because they represent the spirit of the time and in a superficial optimism may be regarded as making for progress christian cognition is not an evolution of truth but a fallible apprehension of truth which must at each point be tested by an accessible absolute norm of truth to take ones stand upon the infallibility of the scriptures is an eminently religious act it honors the supremacy of god in the sphere of truth in the same way as the author of hebrews does by insisting upon it notwithstanding all progress that the old and the new testament are the same authoritative speech of god

2027341 well meaning firms can derail marketing programs by failing to set clear objectives and realistic deadlines and communicating those objectives forcefully to its lawyers she says
2027342 lack of buy in from the lawyers who are crucial to the programs success can frustrate a marketers initial expectations

2027349 hard work on behalf of your clients and integrity and honor in your dealings with everyone are the minimum one can expect of any professional after all a client comes to a lawyer or any professional in time of need and in a matter about which the client has no expertise the client is nervous and most likely emotionally distraught circumstances which would normally render even the most mature and decisive person susceptible to exploitation it is in precisely those circumstances when a professional must conduct him or herself with the utmost honor and integrity recognizing that the person before him or her is entrusting a matter of crucial importance to the professional

2027372 cardiac hypertrophy or enlargement of the heart muscle cells is a hallmark of top athletes especially rowers and is a physical adaptation to increased cardiac load during prolonged periods of exercise our results show both the left and right sides of the rowers hearts are larger and function at an enhanced capacity compared to those of the controls the causes of this strengthening of athletes heart muscle are not completely clear it could be due to the production of growth factors such as igf 1 during training in fact physical exercise is associated with cardiac haemodynamic changes pressure and volume overload able to stimulate the production of growth factors by stretching myocardial fibers
2027373 to this end we investigated levels of the hormone insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 and found significantly increased levels in the rowers compared to the control group although in both groups igf 1 levels were within the normal range
2027374 these results highlight a possible biochemical mechanism for cardiac hypertrophy in elite rowers and suggest a potentially beneficial role for igf 1 in the remodelling of the heart muscle
2027375 further research is now needed to determine the exact relationship between higher production of igf 1 and cardiac output in elite rowers

2027383 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
2027384 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities the letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relations there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity paralyzing mans noblest impulses
2027385 termination was not an option for me and i informed the doctor of this immediately
2027386 he is our creation and gods creation and we will take him as he comes
2027387 with each new day i learn to accept this situation
2027388 for example i know that i cannot change my circumstances and therefore must proceed with the daily grind of life in other ways it becomes more difficult it is a very odd experience to be pregnant knowing that i may never get to bring my baby home from the hospital and that instead of anticipating his whole life i may have to prepare for his funeral and burial
2027389 had i not been so definitely opposed the option of abortion may have been the end of my story except for future psychiatric pills
2027390 i am sure that for many women abortion is strongly recommended in cases like mine especially if women do not have a strong belief about it originally
2027391 i say he must really be extraordinary to be discounting all medical theories with respect to chromosome gene results and his longevity
2027392 i tell him that even the doctors arent sure why hes lived so long most babies with these abnormalities self abort long before now and that he is special because of this i tell you this because i want you to know that despite the grim outlook i am carrying this baby as long as he will let me and will not be the killing hand
2027393 i wish with my heart of hearts that they know of the good that will come

2027413 without any of the civilized limitations in the bill of rights such as equal protection of the laws due process and the prohibition against such cruel and unusual punishments as stoning to death a woman taken in adultery or just suspected indeed it shall possess absolute powers without any prohibition against the discrimination abuse and enslavement of women which happens in some muslim states
2027414 when we speak of human rights in islam we really mean that these rights have been granted by god they have not been granted by any king or by any legislative assembly the rights granted by the kings or the legislative assemblies can also be withdrawn in the same manner in which they are conferred but since in islam human rights have been conferred by god no legislative assembly in the world or any government on earth has the right or authority to make any amendment or change in the rights conferred by god no one has the right to abrogate them or withdraw them nor are they the basic human rights which are conferred on paper for the sake of show and exhibition and denied in actual life when the show is over nor are they like philosophical concepts which have no sanctions behind them

2027419 the connection between religious engagement and political attitudes appears to be especially strong when it comes to hot button social issues such as abortion and homosexuality
2027420 suggests that the efforts of democrats to peel away republican and conservative voters based on economic issues face a real limit because of the role these cultural issues play
2027421 a community of christians inspired by the gospel mandate to put our faith into action to care for our neighbor especially the most vulnerable
2027422 because it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry

2027428 do not introduce creative things do not try and innovate just try and plug on through and keep making it
2027429 well at my old place we did it this way
2027430 at cheesecake were required to tell our names and ask if they dined with us before
2027431 so we can guide them through the menu if they havent been here before
2027432 listen youre not at cheesecake anymore you can give whatever spiel you want and as long as you talk about the features you can do it anyway you want
2027433 so do you have to split the table or are you taking it yourself since you have me today
2027434 uh yeah im taking it myself i dont split tables
2027435 i think you need to split it at cheesecake we have to split groups like that so they get the proper experience
2027436 kid theyll get the service they need and if you want an experience id suggest something a little more adventurous than eating lunch

2027441 this is even more worrisome if you have seen the prehistoric bugs we have in florida
2027442 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
2027443 the mccain campaign is determined to give their paris hilton ad a run for its money in the desperation department and theyve succeeded only in shining a light on the fact that the john mccain of today is unrecognizable from the john mccain of just a couple years ago the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign the new john mccain supports the bush tax giveaways for the wealthy he once denounced opposes his own immigration bill flip flopped on torture and runs negative ads after calling for an honorable campaign frankly it tells you everything about this election that the mccain campaign spins its wheels recycling what we said about john mccain way back when while scrambling and sputtering to explain away governor pawlentys praise of barack obama today
2027444 the current political advantage of the republican party stems from the ability of its candidates to develop signature ideas this strategy is rewarded even when the electorate has ideological reservations
2027445 a rational electorate is reluctant to support someone who does not exhibit commitment to some ideology
2027446 voters rightly perceive that someone without ideological commitment cannot have developed a valuable political program
2027447 to attract a majority of votes parties cannot simply try to appear median quite the contrary

2027459 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease
2027460 we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
2027461 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
2027462 there is a perception that the system we have today is inequitable because only 15 percent of all enlisted personnel and less than half of officers will ever receive anything in the system
2027463 this is a payment made for achieving a particular year of service
2027464 and within the services they would have the flexibility to vary this by year of service as well as by skill that way they could begin to shape the skills by dragging people further into their career by offering them an incentive
2027465 the separation payments would be made available by the service to members that they wished to entice to leave
2027466 therefore the recommendation of this qrmc is that the department of defense conduct a multi year test of this system
2027467 the way the test would work is this all four services would be asked to identify some skills that have different types of retention patterns some that stay not very long some that stay longer periods of time and ones they wish to influence
2027468 if someone was selected for the test they would be paid all of the tsp that they should have earned up until that point and it will be put in their tsp account for them
2027469 the programs vesting rules would in fact apply to all those individuals so should they achieve 10 years of service while they are in the test they would fully own it

2027481 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation
2027482 it makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers milk
2027483 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations
2027484 in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health

2027497 7th circuit court of appeals ruled the madison based freedom from religion foundation and three of its members have no legal standing to bring the case the group was trying to end the agencys practice of asking patients about their religion in spiritual assessments its use of chaplains to treat patients and drug and alcohol treatment programs that incorporate religion
2027498 claimed those practices violated the separation of church and state
2027499 a new partnership is aiming to improve the quality of care at hospitals in rhode island especially the well being of american veterans of war
2027500 was on hand wednesday as rhode island colleges school of nursing
2027501 were chosen to be part of the national va nursing academy
2027502 that pairs vas with top nursing schools across the country
2027503 is 1 of 10 nursing schools selected in the country and the
2027504 has signed a long term lease with owners of the rivers edge professional building to operate a community based outpatient clinic
2027505 has been operating in temporary facilities on the second floor of the building at 15954 rivers edge drive
2027506 security around a nursing home for us veterans has been increased after a worker at risk of losing his job allegedly threatened to buy a machine gun and kill everyone in the facility according to court records
2027507 was charged with threatening an officer of the united states wednesday for allegedly making the statement to an employee benefit counselors at the department of veterans affairs hospital in palo alto on july 31 a special agent with the vas inspector generals office wrote in an affidavit
2027508 he had threatened to harm other nursing employees after he was given a letter stating he would be fired for sexual harassment and abusiveness behavior to staff members the affidavit states
2027509 the department of veterans affairs is offering a new online service my healthevet
2027510 provides access to health information links to federal and va benefits and resources
2027511 my healthevet is a powerful tool to help veterans better understand and manage their health according to va officials
2027512 will be honored at a 10 a m ceremony thursday at the veterans affairs medical center in fayetteville
2027513 senior citizen a young woman and a high school student have joined forces to raise funds for laptops along with a large flat screen tv and wii hab games
2027514 the va center in martinez is expanding with a new neurological cognitive building and its ground breaking ceremony is set for aug 21
2027515 developing an accurate model of ice would help architects civil engineers and environmental engineers understand what happens to structures and systems exposed to freezing conditions
2027516 it could also help us understand and better predict the movement of glaciers
2027517 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero
2027518 the original spin ice research went from one part of the periodic table to a more flexible one
2027519 but artificial spin ice goes off the periodic table altogether
2027520 it mimics the behavior of real ice but is completely designable with specific properties
2027521 we can change the strength of the spin or reformulate the alloy to change the magnetic properties which creates new bulk properties that we either couldnt get from normal materials or couldnt control at the atomic level
2027522 this is the first time the rules of ice behavior have ever been rigorously confirmed by directly counting pseudo hydrogen atoms
2027523 we can track the position and movement of each pseudo atom in our model see where defects occur in the lattice and simulate what happens over much longer periods of time
2027524 our meta material is very similar to patterned hard disk media magnetic bits used in hard drives are usually placed at random but memory density could be increased if they were in a tight regular pattern instead
2027525 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2027526 there are lots of volunteers being gathered in the region and its very hard to withhold them from taking part a real war is going on

2027531 tyson has always led the industry in providing high quality ingredients to the pet food market
2027532 by teaming up with kemin were entering another value added segment of the pet food production process
2027533 we take these complaints very seriously and while we are still looking for a specific cause we are acting to err on the side of caution

2027535 whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it what profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life or what can one give in exchange for his life for the son of man will come with his angels in his father s glory and then he will repay everyone according to his conduct amen i say to you there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom

2027538 this is going to speed up any second it will speed up and it will all be over i need to pay attention
2027539 im glad my body could do it because now i know i have it in me
2027540 we dont have the staff to monitor all the hollywood stories so we wanted an automated feature

2027558 the courts are moving to the position where government can fund religious activities and endorse religion without restraint
2027559 theres quite a powerful trend here in the courts to take the supreme courts decision and really run with it
2027560 i have not yet seen one case where people have brought up this standing issue where the government has lost and the taxpayers have won every single one has been thrown out this is really quite significant
2027561 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
2027562 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
2027563 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
2027564 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
2027565 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
2027566 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
2027567 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2027568 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
2027569 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
2027570 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
2027571 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
2027572 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
2027573 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days
2027574 but in the area of microbiology you also get a rebound affect
2027575 this last ditch effort to resort to some form of alcohol that wasnt a
2027576 yah the mavs are the definite favorites to win it all this year
2027577 i can tell you this that kidd will post better points and assists numbers next year because of the better teammates he has

2027595 jeffs going to help the team tremendously because now well have two legitimate goal scorers with him and kenny cooper you win games by scoring goals and jeffs a proven goal scorer we feel this could be one of the strongest attacking duos in mls soccer
2027596 when they say hes not one of us you dont say heres our plan on health care
2027597 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
2027598 tom burnett jr led the effort to take the plane back
2027599 when i was on the design jury i saw the red crescent of embrace and realized it was an obvious and blatant symbol of islam it does not properly honor our people those flight 93 heroes i think its a travesty that its moved along so fast
2027600 im going to save you from yourselves id like to ask for an unbiased transparent honest investigation this is just a terrible terrible mistake im asking every american we must stop this mistake this panel doesnt own the design i dont own it pennsylvania doesnt own it all of america and all of the world own it
2027601 im not going to stop fighting this thing it is very very bad

2027604 genetic correlates of disruptive behavior disorders amp early onset bipolar disorder
2027605 hi dear heres your belated birthday present i gotta go to the ladies
2027606 whats my secret i may look tough on the outside but really i scream like a girl
2027607 last i saw you you were with your head in a fox hole somewhere in iraq or kuwait
2027608 t here is an outside chance the companies could call upon treasury for more than 100 billion
2027609 it just shows that we are off the hype curve and into solutions
2027610 i think that difficult times should not derail this there will be some ups and downs over the next 50 years but we have to push through that
2027611 most companies in most sectors have opportunities to save money by cutting energy consumption and gas emissions our studies indicate that a lot of companies can reduce them by 20 to 50 per cent
2027612 77 per cent of them would willingly forgo income to work for a firm with a credible sustainability strategy
2027613 the energy and car industries have not been innovative in many years because they have faced no real crisis no impetus for change
2027614 no finger wagging wall street analyst is going to keep them from doubling down on smart bets that will position them well when the economy rights itself again
2027615 i think frugality drives innovation just like other constraints do one of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out
2027616 the judicial task here is not to determine if the administrators decision is correct but only if it is reasonable
2027617 raising debatable points does not entitle the claimant to a reversal under the arbitrary and capricious standard
2027618 put simply an administrators decision will not be overturned unless it is downright unreasonable
2027619 a fter her appeal failed speciale sent the mrc a copy of a favorable ruling by the social security administration granting her application for disability benefits
2027620 what we need today is an economic surge our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones
2027621 tom thanks very much keeping the candidates honest every night
2027622 and now finally were getting some sympathy the turtle man was great but oh dont hurt the guinea pigs just because the turtles dont dress up
2027623 you can see the most recent shots ac360 com is the address right there you can see everything right there do i have to read the rest of it i hope not

2027628 you say you are stuck does that mean the elevator is malfunctioning
2027629 totally we were like in it and it like totally stopped
2027630 ok ok please remain calm we need you to tell us how to get there

2027634 i want you as much as my group wants its land
2027635 i think now is an incredibly strong period for raster noton releases a very strong schedule
2027636 british labels like plant mu and warp of course but really not so many german labels british electronica had more of an influence on us than german electronic labels i listened to idm in the nineties and that was a really big influence at the time the first rastermusik releases had a lot of that dance electronic music influence
2027637 at first we looked for a label to get it released on but it just wasnt happening at the time olaf worked for a big distributor in germany so it seemed easy to set up our own label
2027638 there was a lot of technology around the first cd burners came out music was being more and more computerised and there came a time when it felt right to take control of all this ourselves frank and i started the label in our hometown and carsten lived there too
2027639 while frank and i were much more locally focussed carsten was travelling a lot and then the internet started becoming more and more important after a while we felt we were becoming part of a network we felt especially close to touch and mego communication was easy it was a new situation for us although it was harder than before we started raster noton as our own platform and then things just opened up
2027640 we are artists first so we run the label like a gallery the artists promote themselves and we try to be a family its not especially formal it changes carsten and i do a lot of the design but theres no real specialisation artistically were like a school in the traditions and ideals of the bauhaus a collective to be creative the idea is that were a community and share our ambitions
2027641 i never wanted to run a label or be a businessman i only ever wanted to be an artist and now im quite happy just to be a musician
2027642 today if youre a music freak you can follow a very narrow streak of music for years in east germany there was just too little information about for that to be the case
2027643 eight years since ive moved from chemnitz to berlin and i can see the change
2027644 initially i just used noto but then for my first mille plateaux release prototypes i decided to go for a slightly different name from there i decided to divide things noto is more interested in the physics of sound and the elements of sound but not so much musical structures telefunken is a an inspirational type of work with its cross platform ideas basically alva noto is a specific project thats more interested in a musical approach to sound in the collaborations with ryuichi sakamoto and opto and even transform theres this idea of transforming sound into more musical contexts
2027645 the idea was always to open up another door in the room it was never supposed to be a new direction but was intended as a second field ill continue with this approach and im working on a follow up already id like to have it ready for autumn
2027646 while working on xerrox i got interested in working with loops again thinking about what was coming next that led to this rhythmic album unitxt so im really running on two different tracks now one is this non beat xerrox direction and the other is lets say the more typical alva noto syncopated beat stuff
2027647 i dont categorise what im doing i dont have this problem working out where im going to put something for me it doesnt all have to be together in one operation the label itself feels like a very natural crossing over point between design information and sound im happy with fragmentation one of my working strategies is working with polarities with my works im super logical and organised up to a point but then i try and incorporate errors and mistakes
2027648 we did a lot of experimental stuff in the early years we had to do it because we needed to explore possibilities offered by computers for instance in the nineties it was quite new to make music exclusively on computers but now i feel things have changed and moved away from exploring for me and i guess this is true for carsten as well its just about doing music i still call myself a musician not a scientist im really interested in music and the idea of exploring all these experimental things like the really high sine frequencies its still there and we deal in those sorts of sounds but the main goal now is to make music so thats possibly a change from the early days
2027649 on my first visit to cologne i saw mike ink he was a hero of mine
2027650 weve been friends for a long time i was running this club many years ago and we had this raster noton kompakt night years ago maybe in 98 we had a kind of relation in that many of us shared an interest in this kind of straight beat techno although in many ways voigt never did that he loved all the studio one stuff too there were many connection points but sometimes you have to wait for the artist weve been talking about the gas release since 1999 and since kompakt decided to re release all the gas stuff wolfgang was very interested in putting out this book and cd and he decided to pull out all this unreleased material essentially the earliest recorded material under the project name of gas its been a long conversation but now finally were doing it
2027651 most of the people whose music we release are really close friends and it sometimes takes us a long time to actually get around to releasing something by them
2027652 for instance robert lippok we asked him for that record seven years before he actually gave us the master we work very closely like that with all our artists its not too much like a business here the label is more like a creative platform where we can release ideas and share ideas
2027653 its important to be in a label that doesnt just release stuff thats their own sound each release tries to be a statement basinski started very early with this tape looping and his music hadnt been published before he was a friend of carstens and we really respected his work so it was a pleasure for us to release it
2027654 i lived in new york for a while and i lived in a house with billy he was an incredibly close friend of mine and them we became the label that introduced him with shortwavemusic with that drone sound he was this super melancholic maximalist more than we are the minimalists i always loved his stuff but it actually took me a couple of years to understand that hed fit the label perfectly later he established his own label and now were incredibly happy to see him doing so well
2027655 just keep walking eyes ahead as if nothing has happened
2027656 my blog teachers at risk is two years old how many people years is that
2027657 anjis sweet sweet sweet sweet voice i remember the first time i ever heard her way back in the day i said she could read me a chinese menu or the phone book and i would be all happy
2027658 anjis voice wouldnt be out of place in a smoky jazz or blues bar somewhere down in a dimly lit cellar sultry with a voice like syrupy silky satin with a marshmallow middle and a honey topping
2027659 cosiness abounds as the silken voiced anji bee lead singer of chillout band lovespirals pours a cocktail of mellow dance music mmm
2027660 if youre looking for a different brand of grown and sexy in the podcast world check out anji bee this young lady is bringing it from production to her voice to the music selection she is doing her thazizzle
2027661 no other voice in the podosphere is more sultry than anji bee
2027662 enjoying the chillcast its seriously awesome i listen to them like over and over again
2027663 i just love the tunes anji bee selects and her comments on them i no longer have to search for music to be creative i just susbcribe to the chillcast
2027664 like having a cocktail of lovely tunes and honey poured directly into your ear well chosen music voice links that make you feel cosy inside it all adds up to an essential weekly download
2027665 but you have to agree with apple for yanking it
2027666 youre just the sort of person i imagined marrying when i was little except yknow not green and without all the patches of fungus
2027667 using a variation of mass spectrometry called desorption electrospray ionization or desi
2027668 we were able to lift half a fingerprint from the edge of the pencil the killer used to stab the victim in the eye
2027669 there wasnt quite enough on the print to get a complete number we are having the computer analyze it to fill in the blanks
2027670 youre just the sort of person i imagined marrying when i was little except yknow not green and without all the patches of fungus
2027671 youre just the sort of person i imagined marrying when i was little except yknow not green and without all the patches of fungus
2027672 once i might have said yes but not in retrospect lia taught me that when there is a very dense cultural barrier you do the best you can and if something happens despite that you have to be satisfied with little successes instead of total successes you have to give up total control that is very hard for me but i do try i think lia made me into a less rigid person
2027673 it was also true that if the lees were still in laos lia would probably have died before she was out of her infancy from a prolonged bout of untreated status epilepticus american medicine had both preserved her life and compromised it i was unsure which had hurt her family more
2027674 i told him what had happened later the lees noncompliance with lias anticonvulsant regimen the foster home the neurological catastrophe and asked him if he had any retroactive suggestions for her pediatricians
2027675 first get rid of the term compliance its a lousy term it implies moral hegemony you dont want a command from a general you want a colloquy second instead of looking at a model of coercion look at a model of mediation go find a member of the hmong community or go find a medical anthropologist who can help you negotiate remember that a stance of mediation like a divorce proceeding requires compromise on both sides decide whats critical and be willing to compromise on everything else third you need to understand that as powerful an influence as the culture of the hmong patient and her family is on this case the culture of biomedicine is equally powerful if you cant see that your own culture has its own set of interests emotions and biases how can you expect to deal successfully with someone elses culture
2027676 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
2027677 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties
2027678 you can imagine this liquid looking like mercury only less reflective
2027679 high temperatures make the atoms jiggle around and so people thought that raising the heat would deflect the electrons like putting enough rocks in a stream to block the flow of water
2027680 the scattering caused by atoms was thought to make it harder for the electrons to flow down the stream
2027681 conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects
2027682 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
2027683 we can now for the first time move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer based systems
2027684 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
2027685 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
2027686 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities
2027687 the reduction in pollution happens during a stage of the lifecycle when the rice plant is producing grain this period is normally associated with around half of all methane emissions from rice and we found that simulated acid rain pollution reduced this emission by 24 per cent
2027688 we had similar results when exposing natural wetlands to simulated acid rain but this could be more important since natural wetlands are mostly located far from major pollution sources whereas for rice agriculture the methane source and the largest source of acid rain are both in the same region asia
2027689 we need to do further research but it looks like there could be a combination of processes at work one line of investigation wed like to confirm is that the sulfate component of acid rain may actually boost rice yields this might paradoxically have the effect of reducing a source of food for the methane producing micro organisms that live in the soil
2027690 there is also likely to be competition between these micro organisms and sulphate reducing bacteria normally in these conditions sulphate reducers win which results in less methane
2027691 acid rain is one of several pollution problems in asia that need solving in the coming decades but we need to appreciate the potential consequences of that clean up one of which could be an increase in methane emissions as the effect of the acid rain wears off
2027692 much like humans female guppies produce relatively few eggs and give birth to live offspring they dont lay their eggs for a seasonal spawning but keep them inside their bodies where they are fertilised by the males because they are not reliant on seasons the females have a continuous battle to keep the males at bay so they are resorting to extreme measures to avoid unwelcome attention
2027693 this is what is miraculous about the internet but young people unaware of this
2027694 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
2027695 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
2027696 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
2027697 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
2027698 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment

2027700 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
2027701 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
2027702 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together
2027703 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
2027704 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
2027705 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
2027706 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity
2027707 this study connects quantitative measurements across three levels of observation brain activity genomic variation and the expression of preference we now are investigating the potential role of other genes and will go on to assess how this relationship across three levels of observation may be affected by conditions such as depression and addiction

2027720 first things first the n82 black looks slicker thinner and somehow different from the titanium version it is also very well built and if it wasnt for the squeaking keypad i wouldve given it a 10 10 rating the best part though is that this is the first powerful nseries s60 that i can take out of my pocket and show to women men teenagers and children alike knowing they wont be afraid of its bulkiness or poor looks as a matter of fact i think i made more nseries and s60 converts with the n82 than with any other phone ive had

2027743 lots of canadians live in my florida town they are cheap they buy cheap apartments to live in and eat in cheap restaurants fast food they never shop and dont support local artist or retail businesses theyre always looking for something free they are very nice

2027749 blame lorne michaels or anyone named lorne for that matter
2027750 my experiences are that americans are very nice people more so than canadians because many canadians constantly bash americans in such broad strokes that frankly makes me embarrassed to be canadian

2027773 weldons ability to translate some of our interviews is very useful
2027774 he not only helps with translating the words he can also provide some context or meaning that might be unspoken
2027775 this particular population of wildebeest has declined substantially over the last 15 to 20 years
2027776 weldons tribe the maasai have historically inhabited the savannah grassland where the wildebeest live but people from outside these areas are beginning to show up and convert land into farms which has negative consequences for the wildlife
2027777 the herds of goats and cattle are fine with wildebeests
2027778 so the farmers usually have no problem with them leopards and elephants can cause trouble
2027779 maintaining a healthy wildebeest population is critical both for the local human and natural communities
2027780 this is a perfect example of how undergraduates actively participate in research
2027781 and in this case the undergraduate the graduate student and the faculty member are all learning from each other

2027783 i went from being little known to being the favorite and didnt cope well i was pretty easily distracted it was after the games that realized the value of having a plan not just before the games but after too
2027784 i wasnt enjoying it i was doing it for the money and i had no passion it had become a labor
2027785 i realized that i do love throwing the shot especially the physical challenge but i needed some balance in my life some intellectual stimulation
2027786 i had some issues executing i wasnt balanced at the back of the circle

2027790 its a very special car for customers who want to take the bespoke experience to a higher level every car will be entirely individual
2027791 the usual story read a lot of scripts saw every possible movie
2027792 i think a lot of people assume a lot of things about why square made that announcement
2027793 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us
2027794 so i think people make a lot of assumptions about what they read or the rumours that go around but the reality of a lot of this is that were doing very well we have a great install base we have passionate gamers like you guys that buy a lot of games and a publisher like square cant ignore that
2027795 i think its easy to assume that somethings going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360
2027796 people need care they need to be helped over the hurdle of panic at not having much money and over the larger hurdle of having to rethink their lives and values now is the time for churches to offer career guidance values clarification free events that will be just as enjoyable as extravagance financial and housing assistance and glimpses of a god whose steadfast love is never tied to prosperity
2027797 congregations that taught stewardship will have the funds and staff necessary for such ministry
2027798 charitable giving flows from generosity of course but within it is a strong element of control noblesse oblige and calculation of tax advantage that doesnt leave much room for the humble submission of true gratitude

2027826 insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results

2027828 i have talked about it and asked for the debates since qualifying i thought id try one more time
2027829 there are a lot of issues in front of us from energy to immigration to the war and i think its important that voters know where we stand
2027830 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
2027831 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example that the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there
2027832 so the question is does it make more sense for the oil companies to pay for it or does it make more sense for the struggling waitress who is barely getting by to pay for it
2027833 and the answer is im going to fight for the waitress not because i hate the oil companies but because i think its more fair
2027834 must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being

2027836 its terribly risky to allow the death penalty to be imposed where the jury has to draw inferences about what was in the defendants mind
2027837 there are serious questions about whether a getaway driver who might have anticipated that a death would take place should be death penalty eligible
2027838 he very easily went along with whoever wanted to accept him thats why he ended up in bad company
2027839 he didnt know how to process information the way other people do
2027840 he didnt know how to plan he didnt know how to put things together he loved to fish but he couldnt plan for freshwater versus saltwater his solution was to bring everything
2027841 he was always compassionate and involved with making things easier for other people
2027842 the public may have inadequate information about potential exposure risks or perhaps a false sense of assurance that they do have such information
2027843 we rely on product information such as labels and product regulations to reduce potential risks
2027844 but none of the vocs were listed on any product label
2027845 in particular fragrance compounds used in a wide variety of consumer products can be primary sources of human exposure to vocs
2027846 no evidence suggests that current u k indoor domestic exposures to vocs either individually or as a total pose a health risk

2027858 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms

2027860 as it became apparent they werent going to continue to function they decided to sell off the license we swooped in and grabbed it we took no assets there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up
2027861 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
2027862 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favorites like andoria and qonos
2027863 youre going to see the actual game working and functioning
2027864 this isnt renders this isnt concept art everything that people will see on sunday is going to be taken right from star trek online as it stands today so hardened people should know that a release date might be closer than they think
2027865 the game really feels epic in a way that the burning crusade didnt burning crusade felt like an extension of the original game this really feels epic and that youre part of something grand
2027866 i think itll be just as big if not bigger
2027867 bc was the biggest selling pc game sequel ever i think wrath might be a little lower than that but therell certainly be lines for it
2027868 there will be a lot of pressure to buy it and anyone who has a character at the highest level will pretty much consider it a necessity
2027869 youll be walking through the barrens an area in wow and youll see a steam tank drive past you with five people sitting in it or youll see a death knight clad in frozen armor with five ghouls walking behind him this stuff is wrath only after seeing that who wouldnt want the expansion
2027870 they took it up a notch with the complexity of the scenes and the intricacy
2027871 they have some areas which are now misty which is a really interesting effect walking through a mist previously they had sort of grayed out the scene and called it mist but now its hard to peer through
2027872 theyve again taken the end game and made it more accessible to more people
2027873 without costing the high end players without giving up the challenge that keeps the high end players motivated
2027874 i think blizzard has learned a lot from the last expansion release
2027875 even a group of ten people will be able to conquer the very highest end game content while 25 man versions will let people who want to be more hardcore do that as well
2027876 if youre familiar with the mechanics of the 10 person version
2027877 then you should be familiar with the 25 person version at least in the philosophical sense
2027878 and reward people for doing things they wont normally bother doing
2027879 i know that on their side theyre going to have tons of results coming back that will be useful and which will undoubtedly speed up their development process

2027891 if thats the way it is for you then youre doing it wrong
2027892 i think the citizens of hayward ought to act like tourists
2027893 we should take advantage of all our community has to offer we should jump in the lake canoe down the river hike in the forest go fishing attend the lumberjack show and buy candy at trembleys we should travel the bike path go camping have a feast at famous daves window shop on on main street drive go karts play mini golf and have homemade ice cream at wests dairy

2027908 high pressure is building into the area friday and it will likely be a noticeable change from what we have had temperature and humidity wise over the past few days

2027923 the classic sign of our acceptance of gods mystery is welcoming and making room for
2027924 an answered prayer grace is something thats just given through love pure love and i dont know if we deserve it but i guess we do because god gives it to us thats what i think of grace ive seen it in my own life ive seen it in others
2027925 and the man himself leon rippy is just walking love oh my god hes so talented as an artist but as a man im gonna cry just talking about him he really is just wonderful and meant to play this part hes the kind of angel i would need in my life and hes just a graceful patient loving angel
2027926 so do i he delights in humans and what we do and how we try so hard several times in the show he holds grace thats god to me holding us when were ashamed of something weve done and just there with his arms around us
2027927 i think that helps these moments that are very emotional and very deep and then just butt up against that and make you laugh because i think god has a sense of humor
2027928 there are a lot of people who are appalled and hate the show and tell me im going to hell and better be ready to meet my maker
2027929 we very clearly state that there is a god how you get there what you believe is all up in the air but thats not the message of the show as much as theres this woman who god gives this amazing life this gift of life and so many pleasures in it
2027930 but does she have a relationship with the place that comes from and what should that relationship be grace represents all of us all of us are grace all of our good and our bad all of our appetites for pleasure and even the conflicts of life shes not afraid of those things

2027936 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process i am excited about welcoming brett deanna and their family to the jets organization
2027937 my gut reaction was i really didnt think this was going to come to fruition
2027938 hes coming to a new city hes been in one system for 16 years
2027939 not a lot of connections between brett and our coaching but we were able to talk though coming to the northeast

2027941 i wont need no more federal dollars i wont need no more state dollars
2027942 no matter how low the ethical standards of a country are we cannot imagine that they will always stay that way to do that is to undermine the basic human nature of self improvement we have to believe that someone somewhere will say no to judge a candidate by their skin colour is wrong and so on we have to believe that things will eventually improve in that country and they will also start to hire by competency and pretty soon everyone in that country will do that
2027943 in this school we teach you to be leaders everyone can be a follower and make money in the short term here we teach you to innovate to be leaders to be the force of change and so i would suggest that if you were running that school you should hire by competency and uphold the canadian standards which were higher because ultimately they will follow those standards and then you would have been the leader in setting standards not following them there is always a business case to be made for ethics
2027944 it is hard to understand sometimes especially when we are in the middle of something bigger than ourselves how gods strength can be all that we need

2027958 the sudden gains thursday did little to alter the strong bearish trend of the soybean market

2027960 weve seen energy come down an awful lot so were not getting the pop you would have thought because there are still issues with financials this is really still an economy that is not healthy
2027961 oil and equity market direction from here will likely continue to have modest impact on the u s dollar though following sharp gains there would appear to be some downside profit taking risk for the greenback ahead of the close

2027980 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
2027981 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
2027982 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
2027983 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
2027984 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
2027985 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
2027986 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
2027987 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
2027988 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
2027989 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
2027990 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
2027991 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
2027992 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
2027993 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
2027994 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
2027995 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
2027996 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
2027997 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
2027998 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
2027999 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
2028000 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
2028001 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
2028002 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
2028003 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
2028004 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
2028005 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
2028006 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
2028007 was sent to new york on a project for the book
2028008 detained by federal agents in manhattan he was interrogated and his notes were confiscated violations of his first and fourth amendment rights
2028009 why dont they ask to give us something that we can use to help us make our case
2028010 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
2028011 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
2028012 to the president of the baath revolution party and president of the republic may god protect you
2028013 mohamed atta an egyptian national came with abu ammer an arabic nom de guerre and we hosted him in abu nidals house at al dora under our direct supervision we arranged a work program for him for three days with a team dedicated to working with him he displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
2028014 suskind a pulitzer prize winning journalist tells steve inskeep that a secret mission was conducted in which a british intelligence agent met with the head of iraqi intelligence in a secret location in jordan and
2028015 iin the fall of 2003 the white house decided that a letter should be fabricated dated july 2001 from the iraqi to saddam hussein establishing a link to the sept 11 2001 attacks on the u s and the letter should as well say that saddam hussein has been actively buying yellow cake uranium from niger with the help of al qaeda
2028016 after a white house meeting tenet went back to the cia and ordered his staff to forge the letter listen marine youre not going to like this but here goes tenet told rob richer former head of the cias near east division according to richer
2028017 the guys from the vice presidents office were just barraging us in this period with one thing after another run down this lead find out about that it was nonstop
2028018 richer passed the directive down the chain to the iraq operations group iog was a cia team co led by john maguire clearly also a source for suskind

2028093 for we need to be clear that in the bible the conflict with the gods is a conflict waged by god for us not a conflict waged by us for god to be sure the people of god are involved in spiritual warfare as countless texts in both testaments testify however it is assuredly not the case that god is waiting anxiously for the day when we finally win the battle for him and the heavens can applaud our great victory such blasphemous nonsense however is not far removed from the rhetoric and practice of some forms of alleged mission that place great store on all kinds of methods and techniques of warfare by which we are urged to identify and defeat our spiritual enemies no the overwhelming emphasis of the bible is that we are the ones who wait in hope for the day when god defeats all the enemies of god and his people and then we will celebrate gods victory along with angels archangels and all the company of heaven indeed in the company of heaven we already celebrate the victory of the cross and resurrection of christ the easter victory that anticipates the final destruction of all gods enemies

2028157 kino i am afraid a man can be killed let us throw the pearl back into the sea
2028158 kinos eyes were soft and warm on her then his hand touched her cheek
2028159 and rage surged in kino quietly he tracked her and his brain was red with anger she burst clear of the brush line and stumbled over the little boulders toward the water and then she heard him coming and she broke into a run her arm was up to throw when he leaped at her and caught her arm and wrenched the pearl from her he struck her in the face with his clencehd fist and she fell among the boulders and he kicked her in the side in the pale light he could see the little waves break over her and her skirt floated about and clung to her legs as the water receded
2028160 she knew there was murder in him and it was all right she had accepted it and she would not resist or even protest
2028161 and then the rage left him and a sick disgust took its place
2028162 juana dragged herself up from the rocks on the edge of the water her face was a dull pain and her side ached there was no anger in her for kino he had said i am a man and that meant certain things to juana it meant that he was half insane and half god it meant that kino would drive his strength against a mountain and plunge his strength against the sea juana in her womans soul knew the mountain would stand while the man broke himself that the sea would surge while man drowned in it and yet it was this thing that made him a man half insane and half god and juana had need of a man she could not live without a man although she might be puzzled by these differences between man and woman she knew them and accepted them and needed them of course she woudl follow him there was no question of that sometimes the quality of woman the reason the caution the sense of preservation could cut through kinos manness and save them all
2028163 although she might be puzzled by these differences between man and woman she knew them and accepted them and needed them
2028164 sometimes the quality of woman the reason the caution the sense of preservation could cut through kinos manness and save them all
2028165 drive her strength against a mountain and plunge her strength against the sea
2028166 do we always have to state that the opposite is true in these situations cant we assume that kino also has need of juana as a woman
2028167 and kino had need of a woman he could not live without a woman

2028238 you were the first woman hired by the wall street journal
2028239 that is correct i hate to say how long ago that was
2028240 it happened to be at a time when the journal decided it had to get with the times they hired me straight out of journalism school i was only 20 years old
2028241 i worked in the dallas bureau for three years they covered a seven state area it was intense the journal commands respect wherever they are we had some big companies to cover mostly oil and airlines you alternated between covering the hard financial news and you got a couple of weeks to work on feature stories
2028242 after the journal i discovered that newspapers werent where i wanted to be
2028243 i was only 23 i decided to travel around i went to colorado for a while and then i came to san francisco i ended up in marketing i worked for bank of america for a while
2028244 i decided to take advantage of the hiatus and do what i had always wanted to do to try to write fiction i just started in 2001 i dont know fiddling around with it and somehow the first line of the book came to me
2028245 five days before i graduated from high school my mother embezzled a million dollars and disappeared
2028246 because of my own brush with this kind of embezzlement someone i knew and the rest of the book developed easily from that first sentence
2028247 it was a long and arduous journey to get it published in 2006
2028248 finally i landed an agent and she sold the book quickly after i found her
2028249 it was a grueling path to that agent there are so many books being written and so many people wanting to write books and the number of bookstores is fewer they are dominated by the large chains its more difficult than it used to be to get published
2028250 when i started writing the book i went away to a writing workshop in sin miguel allende id always wanted to go to san miguel i had a great week there it awakened the dormant fiction writer in me
2028251 sometime after i completed the first draft i found a writing group here in san francisco
2028252 i am working on another book i belong to two writing groups now i find them very useful i would recommend that any writer go to a group its hard to ask your friends for their opinion if they dont like your book what do they say thats not useful
2028253 what did you find to be the hardest part of completing the novel
2028254 i have two children kids today expect everything all their friends have new cars and are going to europe they have ipods and new macs and they want to know where their stuff is its very hard for single parents to come up with all of that the book is about a spoiled and pampered girl whos used to getting everything she wants she was very similar to a lot of girls my daughter went to high school with i can understand the desire to cut corners to give her child everything she wants
2028255 a lot of people told me they didnt like the heroine
2028256 my son recognizes the real life incident that inspired the story it was the father of his friend who embezzled money and disappeared this boy ended up living in a camper behind a gas station it was very sad but he pulled out of it
2028257 i changed the story to a girl because i thought it would be an even more difficult situation for a girl i fictionalized it a great deal
2028258 what have been the most interesting reactions youve received to the book
2028259 most reaction has been great its called a young adults book ive been surprised by the number of 40 and 50 year old men who told me they liked the book i didnt write it intentionally for a young female audience i was just trying to tell a good story
2028260 what do you think are your strengths and weaknesses as a writer
2028261 we all struggle with self doubt im a journalist at heart so i dont tend to wax poetic or add a lot of words to my writing or make it flowery i have a journalistic style some people could say thats a weakness that happens to be what i like to read i dont like to read a book with a lot of extraneous digressions
2028262 i have to have time to concentrate to write stephen king supposedly wrote in his familys laundry room with all sorts of distractions going around i dont find that easy
2028263 its a matter of getting the first draft down then working on it once i have the first draft down i enjoy massaging it

2028290 every day in china 320 people are killed in the workplace thats around 110 000 people per year says the head of chinas state administration of work safety li yizhong apparently forgetting some 6 800 victims indicated by the mathematically correct figure li says that he does not expect this situation to improve significantly over the next ten to twenty years mining is the single most deadly industry in addition to the huge number of disease victims it causes over 6 000 people die in chinas mines every year due to fires floods cave ins and gas build up many of these deaths are due to managerial indifference to safety rules or lack of safety equipment and labor rights groups say the true figure is several times higher than this due to extensive cover ups of accidents china frequently launches showy crackdowns announced with glowing headlines in the media to try to reduce the endless cycle of corruption and death in 2005 it announced a campaign to close 7 000 small mines this was slightly under a third of the total number of mines operating at the time approximately 24 000 but the central government soon had to back down on this plan due to extensive opposition around the country officials admitted that by january 2006 nearly 60 of the 5000 mines they had ordered to close had refused
2028291 ironically while attention at home to 320 people dead a day stirs not one change to regulations concerning safety chinese politicians instantly demand actions solutions and apologies when problems involve their citizens overseas
2028292 we hope the italian side deals fairly with the issue and seriously considers the justified demands of local chinese nationals and takes real measures to protect their legitimate rights and interests

2028598 its being done right now and we can do a lot more
2028599 absolutely i think its possible to sequester carbon in the soil this is a hot topic of research right now
2028600 many believe the soil has a large potential to sequester carbon especially degraded soil which should be able to recoup lost carbon this could really be a win win situation because these soil practices almost always improve the agricultural capacity of the land and think about the amount of degraded soil around the world
2028601 the best places are africa and asia but that is where it is hardest to do right now
2028602 aid programs should place far greater emphasis on subsidizing and providing technical and other assistance for soil restoration
2028603 carbon should be a farm commodity people can buy and sell like any other commodity then poor farmers would have another income stream
2028604 what we are proposing is to pay farmers for their important services that we as a society need climate regulation healthy soils
2028605 the effect is that animals trample the grass onto the land where it feeds the soil
2028606 we have land that has been rested for decades and it is still degraded
2028607 the hamburger makes a good symbol of what can be done with carbon farming
2028608 thats absolutely correct about feedlots and absolutely wrong about grass fed livestock sustainably raised grass fed beef is a natural system and the methane and other greenhouse gases are mitigated by the carbon sequestration in the soil we see this as a way to phase out feedlots
2028609 we saw the arctic melt last summer and greenland glaciers slide into the ocean
2028610 and scientists realize that climate change is happening faster than in their models we seem to be a tipping point right now and thats the context for ideas like carbon farming and planting trees sequestration is not a marginal idea but central to any effort keep the planet from tipping into disaster
2028611 humans are part of nature we are part of ecosystems we can be part of the solution
2028612 if the solution to global warming involves large herds of hoofed animals moving through landscape in ways that take carbon out of the atmosphere and into the soil we can do that
2028613 we are environmentalists and thought the best thing to do was kick the cows off and when we did that we watched the coyote bush a natural plant that takes over when there are no animals to eat it kill all the other vegetation on our hills
2028614 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
2028615 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c

2028653 no thank you were on our way to view the mosque
2028654 its a shame that the hagia sophia closes so early have you seen the cisterna basilica yet its still open
2028655 yes thats one of the things ive wanted to see
2028656 let me show you where the entrance is its just a block from here
2028657 i know but it is really no trouble and will save you some time how long are you in turkey for
2028658 the entrance is just here make sure that you walk through all of the passages some people just go into the cisterna take a look and then come back up there is a whole passage to follow and youll see the pillars of minerva and eventually come out about a block down the street
2028659 ill wait for you at the exit in case youd like to have a glass of tea and see our showroom there wont be any pressure for you to buy anything but as long as youre in istanbul you should get to know what types of things are on sale
2028660 thank you but were not buying anything today if we buy anything it will be on our last day
2028661 i didnt say anything about buying anything after all no one needs to buy a rug but this will just give you a chance to get educated and no museums or mosques will be open at that time anyhow and it will be too early for dinner
2028662 did you get to take any pictures can i see them
2028663 and now maybe you would honor me by taking some time to have a glass of tea relax and learn about turkish carpets my shop is just 20 meters this way
2028664 come sit down let me explain the different types of rugs to you and educate you so youll know a good rug from a cheap one here have some tea
2028665 you know no one comes to turkey to buy a rug its not something that you need yet most people end up buying one why because its art its something they decide that they like and its something that they will have and enjoy for the rest of their lives a good rug will last for over 100 years
2028666 you know we really do need to replace the rug in the dining room sometime as well as the rug in rosies our daughter room but we do not need to purchase a rug at this time
2028667 if you could have one of these rugs and if you didnt have to pay for it can you see any of them working in your room
2028668 you have very good taste that rug is 100 wool look here thats how you can tell that they dyes are natural and not artificial look at the weave this is how you can tell it is not machine made it takes someone three to four months working full time to make a rug like this
2028669 i know that you are not looking to purchase a rug in the summer i would start off with a price of around 3 000 for this rug and we would easily sell it for more than 2 500 but if you were interested at all id offer you this rug at 1 800
2028670 thank you but we really are not interested in purchasing a rug right now
2028671 nearly everyone who comes to turkey is not interested in buying a rug but you know nearly everyone who comes ends up buying one because they find something that they really like something that is going to last them the rest of their lives and something that they will forever remember their trip to turkey with
2028672 is there any price where if you could own this rug for that price you would walk out of here happy
2028673 yes and you may end up not purchasing one but is there any price where you would say i am happy to buy that rug
2028674 i guess if i could have that rug for 800 id probably be happy
2028675 this is a rug that i would be selling in the summer for over 2 500 but you know
2028676 you are a very lucky young lady to have a father who has the means and the desire to purchase something like this for you that you really want i hope you appreciate him
2028677 wait a minute thats a line that ive used in sales training before that comes right from joe girardi
2028678 im in education but i used to sell and i used to train sales people
2028679 i think we can come to a deal how about 1 500 for the rug
2028680 i really didnt come here to buy a rug i said that id be happy to purchase the rug for 800 but it really wasnt my intent to purchase one
2028681 i just cannot sell it for 1 000 lets say we have a deal at 1 100
2028682 oh this is the reciprocation technique dont feel that you need to reciprocate only purchase if you want the item

2028689 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
2028690 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
2028691 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
2028692 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
2028693 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
2028694 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
2028695 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine

2028697 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
2028698 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

2028742 i am not speaking to you without a lawyer present
2028743 and if they dont like you they need a suspect and they want to meet their quota and you are in the right place at the right time thats it for you guilty or not
2028744 they can by and large do whatever they want whenever they want
2028745 if youre innocent of the crime thats being investigated and youre still afraid to talk to the police then youre probably guilty of something else and should be in jail anyway
2028746 dave if youre ever questioned by the police dont say anything tell them that you want to speak to a lawyer then call me
2028747 look the cops are there to make arrests and the prosecutors are there to get convictions they arent there to help you out
2028748 you do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so but i must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you if you do wish to say anything what you say may be given in evidence
2028749 oh but it is their right they must be guilty
2028750 your first paragraph makes sense but you lose your credibility with the other two there is no other common profession that i can think of that holds their employees as accountable as police
2028751 you wrote and if they dont like you they need a suspect and they want to meet their quota and you are in the right place at the right time thats it for you guilty or not grow up dave

2028782 no compromise with the main purpose no peace till victory no pact with unrepentant wrong
2028783 not by polls but by principle not by calculation but by conviction
2028784 thus while voters are tolerant of some flip flops the first problem with flip flopping is that it creates doubt in the voters about a candidates current promises because it undermines the sense that the voter can rely on what the candidate says today as a guide to what he will do tomorrow
2028785 you have to concede there is a difference between being willing to compromise and totally changing your position on nearly every issue as soon as the primary season ended
2028786 so youre judging what a politician is going to promise you hope youre not emotionally invested cuz youre likely to be disappointed
2028787 well to a certain degree but you also want a politician who is willing to compromise

2028835 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2028836 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2028837 the olympics are a huge deal for china everywhere you look in this teeming capital city you see vague shapes in the distance that might be large impressive olympic things if you could actually get a good look at them which you cant because the air is swarming with toxic particles the size of milk duds
2028838 i wonder how i hmm you are amazing in a good way i dont lays
2028839 fta has made its position known right from the beginning with regards to the proposed peoples charter in that it does not support the process nor any recommendations that may be put forward by the ncbbf council
2028840 the reasons for this have also been made very clear in that all steps and plans that we need to take as a nation to bring about changes have to be done within the confines of legitimate forums provided for under our constitution
2028841 there are sufficient provisions within our statutes to address needs that do arise from time to time to better aspects of our life as a nation
2028842 impressive internal sales growth across its portfolio largely reflecting pricing improvement and new product innovation
2028843 we want to give the millions of people who will watch the opening as well as the hundreds of athletes taking part the message that there are no human rights in tibet
2028844 the tibetans continue to try and protest in small groups and as long as they keep coming we will detain them
2028845 the total number of detainees has reached 1 100 they are being held at various police stations and will be released later on friday
2028846 tibetans have been dismayed at chinas interference in tibet for a long time this day is an opportunity for us to attract the worlds attention
2028847 ive been coming here nearly every day for the past three months and i will continue
2028848 i was told that the letter was given to him by mr bainimarama before the government team left for china for the olympic games and the letter states that he has until august 22 to clear himself from public office and that will be in the next two weeks
2028849 this means he wont attend the next cabinet meeting on august 22 and i challenge mahen to tell the people that his job is on the line
2028850 and i am prepared to take mahen head on in any battle or whatever battle he may want to take out with me
2028851 this was also confirmed to me and my friends this evening yesterday from a senior government official who is also out of the country saying that mahen is going out of the regime
2028852 this should have been done long time ago because he has only brought problems to the countrys economy
2028853 what is human is what is natural to man and what is most essentially or most specifically natural to man is what relates to the absolute and which consequently requires the transcending of what is earthly in man there is a great deal of talk these days about humanism talk which forgets that once man abandons his prerogatives to matter to machines to quantitative knowledge he ceases to be truly human what is most profoundly and authentically human rejoins the divine by definition
2028854 objectivity of intelligence the capacity to see things as they are in themselves next objectivity of will hence free will and finally objectivity of sentiment or of soul if one prefers the capacity for charity disinterested love compassion t he human miracle must have a reason for being that is proportionate to its nature and it is this that predestines or condemns man to surpass himself man is totally himself only by transcending himself quite paradoxically it is only in transcending himself that man reaches his proper level and no less paradoxically by refusing to transcend himself he sinks below the animals which by their form and mode of passive contemplativity participate adequately and innocently in a celestial archetype in a certain respect a noble animal is superior to a vile man
2028855 in sri aurobindos formulation the first infinite divine plane is pure existence which he calls sat being reality sat is not merely pure existence or chit empty consciousness rather as aurobindo explains it is a conscious existence existence is consciousness and there can be no distinction between them
2028856 if we regard the gradation of worlds or planes as a whole we see them as a great connected complex movement the higher precipitate their influences on the lower the lower react to the higher and develop or manifest in themselves within their own formula something that corresponds to the superior power and its action
2028857 in more detail particular forces movements powers beings of a higher world can throw themselves on the lower to establish appropriate and corresponding forms which will connect them with the material domain and as it were reproduce or project their action here
2028858 what takes place in life has always behind it pre existent movements and forms in the occult i e hidden transcendent or nonlocal vital planes what takes place in mind presupposes pre existent movements and forms in the occult mental planes
2028859 but all this must not be taken in too rigid and mechanical a sense
2028860 first each plane in spite of its connection with others above and below it is yet a world in itself with its own movements forces beings types forms existing as if for its and their own sake under its own laws for its own manifestation without apparent regard for the other members of the great series at most we can say that the existence of anything in the vital subtle physical or any other plane creates a possibility for a corresponding movement of manifestation in the physical world but something more is needed to turn that static or latent possibility into a dynamic potentiality or an actual urge towards a material creation
2028861 the endeavor to frame a coherent logical necessary system of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be interpreted
2028862 but i want to go back on a posting from yesterday that stated that a
2028863 no matter where i go theologically i find that some lofty christian thinker has preceded me there
2028864 but i think the key is to realize these things not merely learn them
2028865 i bet if one were dropped on ray he would promptly look down to see where it came from
2028866 why should i give thanks for the food on my table
2028867 at least there are some good smackdowns of this jackass in the comments
2028868 lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the

2028871 calculator one of the handiest uses of google type in a quick calculation in the search box and get an answer its faster than calling up your computers calculator in most cases use the symbols and parentheses to do a simple equation

2028884 creative artist leading a faith community in contemporary expressions of worship and liturgy
2028885 is what i do important where is the flame that burned in me so brightly that clarified my calling to this why should i continue to do this when i could turn the direction of some of my other passions for art graphic design anthropology public speaking or writing
2028886 i know this must be important my style may change and the forms may vary but leading people into worship has got to be a very important thing that i do i will lead people in living acts of worship and allow that call to become a part of my greatest dreams

2028888 in a consumer recession discretionary items are scrutinized and we believe that even low priced books will fall into that category of nice to have items
2028889 the entire newspaper industry is in a deep recession possibly the deepest in 70 years and it may well worsen
2028890 we will weather this difficult period however long it lasts by aggressive actions to reduce costs conserve cash and gain share in the declining advertising market
2028891 in short the web based service lets employees keep record of work they have completed employees can then submit a weekly or monthly report to their manager in the form of a chart graph or simple summary and receive feedback through the system the service is designed to drive performance reviews eliminating the need for status meetings and allowing employees to be evaluated based on concrete information rather than a managers impressions
2028892 in earlier days attica yielded far more abundant produce in comparison of what then was there are remaining only the bones of the wasted body all the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away and the mere skeleton of the land being left
2028893 icelandic society survived only through a drastically lower standard of living
2028894 soil erosion is second only to population growth as the biggest environmental problem the world faces
2028895 yet the problem which is growing ever more critical is being ignored because who gets excited about dirt
2028896 one that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
2028897 not having or showing any care for the consequences of personal actions
2028898 this has been an extremely hard decision for me to make ive given everything i can to be ready to compete at this olympic games
2028899 its best for me to step down and have another athlete fill my position this is something for me thats very tough because its end of my career and its not the way i had planned it
2028900 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
2028901 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
2028902 im going to shoulder this remorse and guilt for the rest of my life
2028903 its always best to be on or ahead of schedule
2028904 you do what you need to do i love you
2028905 as we get older so do our parents and the time that we spend with them is important
2028906 there was a crisis in tibet then the world forgot about burma
2028907 and now everyone has forgotten about tibet headlines have a short lifespan were not expecting massive change because of our event we just want to keep burma on the agenda
2028908 even if you just examine the situation inside china look at all the people forced to leave beijing just to make the city look nice the olympics is about money and politics and presenting power
2028909 it is necessary for all olympians to be able to learn about the real situation in china and to point out human rights violations freely whenever and wherever
2028910 we are concerned that the beijing olympics might simply become a giant spectacle to distract the attention of the international public from the violations of human and civil rights in china
2028911 when all is said and done after the demonstrations of last year and the cyclone of this year the army still has all the guns bottom line
2028912 we are completely impartial and are not trying to hurt anyone by posting the information online
2028913 we are attempting to reach maximum transparency this is the best way to guarantee public access to our activities
2028914 these records do not necessarily mean that the person listed actively cooperated with vkr only the actual files can show that those would be too large to post online in their entirety
2028915 even being a confidante is not considered active cooperation according to the constitutional court
2028916 there is nothing simpler than to clear anyone of any wrongdoing just publish all available files as proof
2028917 i have never knowingly worked with any repressive branch of the communist regime
2028918 i never reported on anyone nor did i perform any tasks for the secret service
2028919 i want the whole thing to go to court i want to prove that i have never knowingly collaborated with the vkr
2028920 to me it looks like they picked my name off an old list
2028921 the address i am supposed to be living at was three years old at the time and i even served in a different unit at the time the report was written youd think the soldiers could at least get that right
2028922 information provided by hasil concerned moral and political feelings in the unit
2028923 it is just shocking that lies written 25 years ago can still make your life difficult after such a long time
2028924 all i can say is that even though my name is in the register i never knew about it i have no idea why my name is there because i never met with any vkr operatives while i served in the army
2028925 we were debriefed every single time all athletes faced a simple choice between a sports career and enduring a short talk with secret service personnel
2028926 the worst i ever told them was that wed met friends who emigrated or showed them what i bought for my kids at a duty free shop
2028927 i am considering legal action to clear my name so my lawyers have to study it first
2028928 just right the red i was hoping for at least now i know what kind of red to aim for if i want to use it in future prints
2028929 some of the most important lessons to be learned from welch come from his often brutally enforced guidelines for making a great pitch

2028936 with a much improved performance onscreen we have countered the myth that itv is a business managing decline
2028937 in my first year back at itv we put together a growth strategy for the business and strengthened the senior team
2028938 the first priority for itv was to stem the decline we did more than that delivering an increase in viewing to the itv family for the first time in over a decade

2028941 we need to compete with singapore to develop regional banks

2028946 i will watch the olympics more now roy said last month
2028947 before i would just watch and see if sergio rodriguez got in a game now im very curious about it because our management is extremely high on rudy i hear he is a good player
2028948 he is supposed to be a key for us next season roy said
2028949 i definitely want to see what he can do i might have seen one highlight on him he could walk past me and i wouldnt know who he was but i want to watch him and get familiar just to see what he does what his weaknesses are and where he can help our team
2028950 he could walk past me and i wouldnt know who he was
2028951 for me to have him around 290 thats pretty doggone good jensen said
2028952 would i like him to be lighter yeah but we havent allowed him to do much until recently
2028953 the trainers at ohio state said when he plays basketball he drops the weight pretty quickly jensen said
2028954 and i think we will see the weight come down now that he is out on the court and burning calories
2028955 microfracture has been around for about twenty years it is only used when the articular cartilage thats like the clear cartilage you see in the joint of a chicken on your table it keeps everything moving nice and smoothly in your major joints as you move around has been pierced or torn all the way through such an injury would typically occur in a single incident he says although it can occur with many small injuries over time
2028956 where those microfractures are made marrow cells and blood form a clot
2028957 a fibro cartilaginous cap its not real cartilage its not as good as what god gave you but with proper recovery it can often perform at a similar level
2028958 but can they play at a high level for as many years as someone who has not had this kind of injury and surgery
2028959 thats a very legitimate concern what effect may this have on his longevity the truth is nobody knows but its certainly not a good thing
2028960 sitting together in the darkness waiting for something to burst
2028961 following the cooking here is like watching a gabriel garcia marquez novel unfold
2028962 but xrlq the statement is true at least technically you can get a free credit report from freecreditreport con er i mean com all you have to do is sign up for a worthless service no one in his right mind would want wait until your free credit report arrives and then call an aol esque you dont really want to cancel this valuable service do you maze to finally cancel the worthless service you never wanted in the first place all to obtain a credit report you really could have gotten free from the site they hoped youd confuse them with

2028967 the heritage tvc thrust vector control system does have some shortcomings the system is a design that has not been in production for 20 years the ares launch architecture may seek expendable launch vehicle solutions and the cost associated with production of new heritage hardware would be prohibitive
2028968 many russians were very surprised that the french government was not represented
2028969 there were two of us myself and deputy dominique souchet
2028970 i explained to the family that the french politicians were at the olympic games
2028971 to pay a final homage to his personal friend and to the fighter that will remain in history as the greatest dissident of the 20th century
2028972 vend e had welcomed alexander solzhenitsyn for six days in september 1993 he had insisted on making the special trip to inaugurate the memorial
2028973 he declared there his opposition to the revolutionary principle of tabula rasa and said that in vend e the red wheel the matrix of totalitarianism had been identified for the first time
2028974 there were two of us myself and deputy dominique souchet
2028975 there were two of us so and so and myself
2028976 creating a file with most of the posts weeding out really trivial one
2028977 i write from life experiences everything from guys to books i read that are inspiring to me someone will say something and ill think thatll be a great song title i just take a little bit of everything
2028978 when i have free time i like to hang out with my friends and go to the coffee bean and talk since i entertain all day its my job i dont ever want to feel like im doing that just to sit and relax is nice
2028979 i totally believe in guys and girls being friends mandys jiroux my only real girlfriend besides ashley nino and other girls i work with theres been so many hard things that have happened so ive kinda lost my girlfriends
2028980 my moms never had a drink in her life because she doesnt like that kind of stuff at all my dad grew up with an alcoholic mother and i saw how that really hurt him so i would never want to put myself in a position where i could hurt someone from the use of alcohol or drugs or whatever so im not really into that kind of thing
2028981 i have lots of different favorite beauty products the thing for me that i always have to have is blush because i think that just makes you glow so no matter what i always throw that on my favorite one is by benefit because they look really light young and pretty

2028985 a network of such centers would ensure nondiscriminatory access for non nuclear states to low enriched fuel for nuclear power plants with all nonproliferation requirements observed
2028986 a european wide competition has caused controversy in donegal today as letterkenny residents have been objecting
2028987 the difference being irish nationalists can fly the tricolour in northern ireland he said if he flew the union flag from his house in the republic his house would be burnt down as for orange parades welcome in donegal there is only one a year and thats at the seaside how welcome would an orange parade be in letterkenny
2028988 i will never have a job as cool as this one is
2028989 this agreement is tremendously significant at a time when the political authorities in israel and palestine and the international community are failing to find just and lasting solutions to the political impasse it means that the pgftu will be able to ensure much more effective representation for palestinian workers while those working for israeli employers will also benefit
2028990 the agreement calls upon the ituc and its affiliates to continue to support future cooperation and we are fully committed to do this
2028991 this removes a key obstacle to future cooperation and the full respect of the rights of palestinian workers decent work is a foundation stone for political and economic justice and we will now be in a position to devote even more attention to tackling the appalling state of the palestinian economy and playing a fuller part in the quest for justice fairness and democratic rights in the building of a palestinian state
2028992 we are very pleased that this agreement has now been reached
2028993 every worker whether of israeli palestinian or other origin must have full rights to the protections offered by international labour standards the outcome of our dialogue with the pgftu can only help achieve this and help lay the foundations for future cooperation between israeli and palestinian trade unions and progress in our shared quest for justice peace and prosperity for all in the region
2028994 maybe ill be in the german house or maybe ill be somewhere else reading a book and drinking a beer
2028995 this is my fourth games i understand athletes want to march in the opening ceremony because its a life dream thats ok with me
2028996 there is a big difference from the chinese people who are looking forward to celebrating the games and the government which is using the opening ceremony as a platform to show how perfect everything is in china
2028997 its a bit of a circus and i refuse to attend it
2028998 more reports of local muslim clerics referring people to the taliban in part because of their commitment to shariah or islamic law
2028999 this erotic romance by ms da costa is one of the best i have ever had the pleasure to read and i am looking forward to reading many more by her
2029000 more pleasure than you could ever imagine ive become addicted
2029001 a pretty amusing if silly sex romp that will most likely fit the bill if you are looking for something naughty to read
2029002 with her usual strength of character sense of fun and powerfully passionate prose portia da costa shows us that even the lifeless hearts of the undead can still beat with the stirrings of romance
2029003 hotbed is a perfect showcase for portia da costas inestimable talent
2029004 suite seventeen contains all portias trademark treats from the arousing narrative a wicked blend of deviant episodes and an undercurrent of pragmatic and poignant romance
2029005 continuum is an intelligent articulate foray into an erotic world lurking just beneath our civilised society
2029006 witty engaging narrative strong characters and description so vivid the scenes rise three dimensionally from the page
2029007 i remember hearing the joke about the iraqi soldiers eating nivea thinking its yogurt
2029008 of course this is going to be seen as a new form of tourism
2029009 there are a lot of people who are interested in this type of space travel and every person has a different reason for being interested
2029010 some like it because its new and trendy others are interested because they feel they are contributing to a worthy cause for the future of course they are all looking at it as a great experience that will change peoples lives
2029011 in total there have been fewer than 500 people who have traveled into space and we can assume those 500 were among the worlds healthiest people
2029012 this is going to be a new opportunity for your average citizen as someone with an average state of health will be safe enough to travel to outer space with virgin galactic
2029013 space travel used to be available only to a close knit group of academics and heroes
2029014 just a few years ago most people wouldnt have dreamed this type of privately funded travel would become available
2029015 at this point in time its mostly financial limitations that will restrict the number of travelers
2029016 however as with any other type of commercial activity once the first journey is successful the number of trips will increase and the price will eventually decrease
2029017 we have to come up with a compromise that should be acceptable for everyone
2029018 such a concept is unheard of in modern infrastructure planning
2029019 i must inform you that within a few days we will begin the process of closing the railway line from d n to old ichov after that the track can be used for the construction of the planned highway
2029020 because certain groups are trying to prove that the line is still needed for local transport you can expect large media interest therefore i ask the environment ministry to refrain from any activities with regard to the highway until a final decision is made
2029021 canceling a perfectly good regional railway is against two major government policies it would be an act against the environment and also disagrees with the national transport policy which clearly states the promotion of rail transport as one of its goals
2029022 all studies showed that heavy traffic would be diverted to this new highway
2029023 this would have led to a significant drop in noise and pollution levels
2029024 trains that usually took kids to school suddenly started running an hour later while weekend schedules became extremely tourist unfriendly with no connecting transport no wonder people stopped using the trains
2029025 usually repairs are planned many months in advance and the transport company and local mayors are consulted to solve any problems arising from the closure this was unexpected and deliberately timed to hurt us as much as possible we are considering legal action
2029026 we hope services will be resumed as soon as possible but currently we have no idea how much of the track has been taken apart
2029027 you idiot what the hell did u say that for
2029028 yo i wanna do an all female dj night called girl on girl give me once a month we need more girls in here
2029029 inkingmarkets i put in there questions about the opening date of the casino and some local political races it had some interesting results
2029030 its terribly risky to allow the death penalty to be imposed where the jury has to draw inferences about what was in the defendants mind
2029031 there are serious questions about whether a getaway driver who might have anticipated that a death would take place should be death penalty eligible
2029032 he very easily went along with whoever wanted to accept him thats why he ended up in bad company
2029033 he didnt know how to process information the way other people do
2029034 he didnt know how to plan he didnt know how to put things together he loved to fish but he couldnt plan for freshwater versus saltwater his solution was to bring everything
2029035 he was always compassionate and involved with making things easier for other people
2029036 its worth noting that mccains approach to a payroll tax increase seems relatively similar to obamas approach to increased coastal drilling its an unwelcome idea that might be necessary to get opponents on board with a more comprehensive bill in other words obama doesnt support increased coastal drilling but if its the price of getting broad support for a comprehensive energy bill so be it and mccain doesnt like the idea of a payroll tax increase but if its part of a broader reform effort hes open to it and closed to it and open to it and closed to it

2029054 and sometimes you turn the corner and youve got a straightaway and its beautiful and then you can turn a corner at the end of that straightaway and its thunderstorms and mountains and it can be hard even within the same day
2029055 but thats what faith is its living with the questions that doesnt mean you have the answers thats exactly what faith is
2029056 the lord jesus has saved me from sin and death and lord has chosen me for his ministry i believe i have faithfully and truthfully done it according to the word of god by the guidance of the holy spirit
2029057 doctors say cancer medication and treatments are very hard on the body and they may cure the cancer but can create other medical issues like liver cirrhosis and other major sickness
2029058 the lord jesus has saved me from sin and death and lord has chosen me for his ministry i believe i have faithfully and truthfully done it according to the word of god by the guidance of the holy spirit whenever our lord thinks my service is enough in this world he has to call me back at any time to be with him i am always ready for it
2029059 i never earned or gained anything worldly for my wife and children from the ministry i hand over the ministry and all of its assets programs and activities to the governing board in which my wife or children are not the members

2029062 u pon the strength of their poetry the poets believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which they were not wise
2029063 because they were good workmen though that they also knew all sorts of high matters and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom
2029064 god only is wise and by his answer he intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth little or nothing
2029065 know ing that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing
2029066 men of athens i honour and love you but i shall obey god rather than you
2029067 the fear of the lord that is wisdom and to shun evil is understanding
2029068 always forbids but never commands him to do anything which he is going to do
2029069 we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any one whatever evil we have suffered from him
2029070 make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else
2029071 no one knows whether death which men in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil may not be the greatest good
2029072 what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself
2029073 i ought to be grieved at death if were not persuaded in the first place that i am going to other gods who are wise and good i do not grieve as i might have done for i haev good hope that there is yet something remaining for the dead and as has been said of old some far better thing for the good than for the evil
2029074 has reason to be of good cheer when he is about to die and that after death he may hope to obtain the greatest good in the other world the true philosopher is always pursuing death and dying and if this be so and he has had the desire of death all his life long why when his time comes should he repine at that which he has always been pursuing and desiring
2029075 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
2029076 he would like as far as he can to get away from the body and to turn to the soul
2029077 we always carry around in our body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be revealed in our body for we who are alive are always being given over to death for jesus sake so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body
2029078 if we would have pure knowledge of anything we must be quit of the body
2029079 our ancestors who formerly maintained these places loved wisdom and through it they obtained wealth and passed it on to us

2029107 there is no excuse for the legislatures failure to reach a compromise and to send me a budget
2029108 until the legislature passes a budget that i can sign i will not sign any bills that reach my desk
2029109 but we do not have the luxury of stretching out this process any longer
2029110 they shouldnt be paid and they should never get that money back
2029111 my fear is that simply creates another tension between the administration and the legislature that is really unnecessary
2029112 many of the bills the legislature passes do california more harm than good
2029113 there is no excuse for the legislatures failure to reach a compromise and to send me a budget

2029116 they shouldnt be paid and they should never get that money back

2029128 quite visible and striking transformation of the consciousness of the individual in question a change not merely in the content of experience but in the individuals mental and spiritual adjustment
2029129 groups which work up the material of their common experiences in different specific ways constitute separate generation units

2029131 baquba aug 7 ips the crisis over electricity failure grows as summer temperatures climb and a drought plagues iraq it is a crisis iran is using to help iraqis where the u s has failed
2029132 i cannot exclude electricity from my thinking when i think of making any plans i have to factor the lack of electricity
2029133 we cannot work without electricity because generators are not dependable
2029134 when i decided to purchase an updated model of my bakery i did not think of electricity
2029135 i could not operate it at all because of the inconsistency of electricity the bakery needs stable power it cost around 45 000 dollars now im ready to sell for 20 000 dollars

2029139 i dont regard myself particularly as a photojournalist im a documentary photographer the idea of my work is to try put my finger on the zeitgeist of whats happening thats constantly changing and shifting im not interested in photographing things that are disappearing although ive engaged in a slight bit of nostalgia im interested in things as they are now
2029140 ive been doing a set of pictures called luxury wealth to me is as much to me the front line as poverty traditionally was
2029141 im not waiting to be assigned i go to places i want to go and see how they fit in if i wait for the phone to ring for me to go to the places i want to go its not going to happen so i determine where i want to go and then try to get the magazines to help
2029142 another story i did last october was about millionaires in moscow i did the gulf art fair all these things in the end have been quite beneficial to me in terms of sales and theyre constantly adding to my portfolio of work its a big jigsaw puzzle im trying to work out as we go along about my relationship to the world we live in
2029143 its a highly competitive market clearly one of the things that potentially distinguishes you is that you have a known voice in photography picture editors like to commission new exciting photographers theyll take that risk of course its not easy if it was easy then everybody would be at it there are more magazines now than ever before but they have to be filled with something i agree that im in a better position than most im in a very privileged position and it has taken years to get there
2029144 independent analysts working separately claim to have discovered that the original hawaiian certificate of live birth used in the fabrication of the barack obama

2029148 more reports of local muslim clerics referring people to the taliban in part because of their commitment to shariah or islamic law

2029151 today i got the call that my sister rivka devorah bas yehudis chana died of a drug over dose in her sleep i got the call while my mother was on the way to identify the second daughter she lost
2029152 this reminds me of a rodney dangerfield line to the effect that his idea of a good date is if we wakes up the next morning and still has his wallet
2029153 it hurts so bad because you put so much into it i look at all of our sports it is really really hard to win at the end of every year when you look at how many great teams did come up short in the end it is to some extent frustrating
2029154 a year and a half after the debut of facebooks web site it was built by copying the look feel and features of facebook com
2029155 facebook is concerned that because studivz looks like facebook and incorporates similar features and functionality to facebook users will incorrectly believe that studivz is associated with facebook

2029158 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site
2029159 less than 002 percent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
2029160 if we get a report of a bug or a hole from a user a security researcher a reporter blogger or anyone we check it out and fix it as quickly as possible
2029161 in fact we appreciate it when help comes our way from the many security experts and organizations out there
2029162 weve witnessed the international online gaming marketplace becoming increasingly predatory with online gaming ventures often spending more than the lifetime value of a customer in order to acquire market share something that we are not prepared to do
2029163 we are looking very hard at that business to see what makes sense for us because there are costs just in keeping it going and so as we balance that wed have to make the decision whether it makes sense to continue just by limping along or whether its more expensive to do that but we certainly dont want to have a money loser so we are in the middle of that analysis right now and i would say by the next quarter earnings call we will have a real solid understanding of what we plan to do going forward
2029164 the cause of the current troubles dates back to 1980 when us president ronald reagan and uk prime minister margaret thatcher came to power soros said it was during this time that borrowing ballooned and regulation of banks and financial markets became less stringent these leaders soros said believed that markets are self correcting meaning that if prices get out of whack they will eventually revert to historical norms instead this laissez faire attitude created the current housing bubble which in turn led to the seizing up of credit markets
2029165 we compare and contrast neoclassical economic theory which suggests that banking deregulation increased competition better information and improved risk assessment reduce or eliminate mortgage market discrimination with a sociological theory of networks which argues industry restructuring can disrupt markets and social relationships and create new opportunities for exploitation
2029166 we argue that as the old inequality in home mortgage lending has slowly diminished a new inequality has emerged that is characterized by less favorable loan term sometimes problematic forms of housing and a lack of adequate consumer protection from predatory and abusive practices
2029167 as neighborhood bank branches close new lenders and new kinds of lenders have entered the market the connection of networks that formerly existed though underdeveloped in many cases among local borrowers and local lenders are transformed economic restructuring and the disruption of old networks have created additional loan opportunities for underserved markets but the nature of these loans is often very different from those made to other borrowers
2029168 up to the late 1970s home equity loans hels were virtually non existent in fact in 1980 total hels were a mere 34 billion however at the end of 1995 they totaled approximately 340 billion
2029169 at the same time that home equity lending was gaining in popularity so were credit cards when the us recession of 1991 occurred many consumers with high credit card debt were unable to pay their monthly balances due to job loss or other financial problems the recession was particularly hard on single and recently divorced women
2029170 bankruptcy fillings by women rose by 838 percent four times as fast as other categories from 53 000 to 497 000 once a small minority in bankruptcy court as of 1999 single women comprised the largest bloc 39 percent of all personal bankruptcy cases
2029171 this new population of credit impaired consumers provided a new opportunity marketing home secured subprime loans as a way to consolidate and pay off credit card debt
2029172 due to wide economic swings massive layoffs and regional recession as well as increases in the divorce rate and the high number of business failures over the past 10 years the subprime market has mushroomed
2029173 the us believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
2029174 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground

2029177 we recognise that many young people leave education for work or further training at relatively low income levels and we are keen to help them to carry on using our buses at an attractive rate
2029178 young people are central to our future business and many of them have a high degree of environmental awareness and want to carry on using public transport we are also aware that when starting out in work or training transport costs can be a high proportion of income we hope this scheme will help to make school leavers mobile within the work and social environment and offer them an incentive to keep on using environmentally friendly public transport

2029183 ninety percent of our clients are men and when i go out there and ski with them its great but i cant help but wonder why more women dont come out and do this it is incredibly fun and really exciting and you dont have to be an expert
2029184 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2029185 i wouldnt want to belong to any club that would have me as a member
2029186 blairs biggest failure was his first term by the middle of the second term he knew what he wanted to achieve and had a pretty good idea how to achieve it but his authority was diminished there was iraq and gordon brown was obstructing his public service reforms we are not interested in winning for the sake of it we have a vision of how britain can be it will take a long time to deliver it so we had better start from day one
2029187 why does the defense always seems to dominate the offense in the early days of fall camp
2029188 the goal of the defense is disruption while the goal of offense is organization its just a whole helluva lot easier to create havoc than to prevent it
2029189 the 49ers foundation does a lot of cool stuff for underprivileged children in the bay area theyre a great group where 100 percent of their donations go to children and they have gone as far as creating a school
2029190 the masters foundation gives over 30 scholarships a year to kids in the far west the masters racers collect money over the season and then they distribute it in the fall to children what theyve been able to do in our region is amazing
2029191 well when i was younger i received scholarships for multiple years from the masters foundation so that was something that meant a lot to me to be able to give back because they mean so much to me and have allowed me to do what i love for other kids in the area to experience that is special to me
2029192 the swim was hard for a mountain girl like me but i made it then the biking and the running was natural to me
2029193 it was tough but i had a smile on my face the whole time and i want to do it again

2029195 he was very happy to be here with us in the czech republic he hadnt been to many places in prague yet but when hed take the bus home from work hed talk about how excited he was to explore the city
2029196 in the past ren did business with toys and textiles but what his business is now we do not know
2029197 we went to check on one of his firms but when we went there to inquire no one knew what we were talking about there was no company like that there
2029198 we knew him because he helped with our business he acted as a sort of middle man to pay the factories for our companys goods when we found out that ren hadnt paid the factory qian said hed contact him and then meet with him to negotiate
2029199 the fact is that ren owed money to the lu family
2029200 the two men met up because of this exchange and then something occurred that is still not entirely clear
2029201 right now we dont know how far the police have investigated its already been four weeks and we still dont know if any chinese authorities have been contacted
2029202 we believe that czech police will investigate the case in agreement with the law and the offender will be arrested soon
2029203 people had a habit of looking at me as if i were some kind of mirror instead of a person they didnt see me they saw their own lewd thoughts then they white masked themselves by calling me the lewd one
2029204 i knew i belonged to the public and to the world not because i was talented or even beautiful but because i had never belonged to anything or anyone else
2029205 everybody is always tugging at you theyd all like a sort of chunk out of you i don think they realize it but its like grrr do this grr do that but you do want to stay intact intact and on two feet

2029211 it aint the best there were some missed tackles there were some third down conversions there was some rushing yardage there was getting pushed around there were some snaps where we had people dogtrotting we did some things we werent very proud of we were glad to win the ballgame but by no stretch of the imagination was that a work of art their backups just played a little bit worse than our backups
2029212 we will get to see guys under the big lights
2029213 we will get to see guys we havent seen at this level in an nfl exhibition game its probably as fast as any game they will ever play so we get to see the young guys in that situation
2029214 as parents prepare to send their children back to school they should call the governor to veto sb 1322
2029215 every parent should have the assurance that their child will not be exposed to communist brainwashing in their classroom in addition to approving such brainwashing lawmakers also decided that childrens safety is not as important as their radical political agenda they rejected their chance to protect students from terrorists infiltrating their schools
2029216 the beijing olympics represent a vision of the kind of future for which the communist party usa strives a world where people from hundreds of countries come together peacefully to enjoy a common cause
2029217 apparently communists believe that silencing peaceful protesters and dragging them to jail is part of coming together peacefully
2029218 parents should be outraged that california legislators want to allow communists unfettered access to our children
2029219 do communist teachers define peaceful like the communist police who arrested the americans in beijing if so their teaching will certainly include instruction on how to overthrow the bill of rights especially the freedoms of speech and religion
2029220 americans look to governor schwarzenegger to continue the legacy of fellow california governor ronald reagan in standing against the continuing evil of communism
2029221 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2029222 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
2029223 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2029224 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2029225 all of us hundreds of thousands of georgians here and abroad should come together unite and fight to save georgia we are a freedom loving people and if our nation is united no aggressor will be able to harm it
2029226 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
2029227 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
2029228 these troops that are in georgia now they didnt come unexpectedly
2029229 they had been amassing at the border for the last few months they claimed they were staging exercises there and as soon as a suitable pretext was found they moved in
2029230 were they not pleased with the results they got the first time
2029231 its just annoying that all this misinformation is out there he should have announced his separation a lot earlier than he did she was always told he was separated theres no way she would ever get involved with another married man after jude law

2029447 the governments attempts to close the widening gap between rich and poor have failed these figures highlight yet again that children from less well off backgrounds do not get the same opportunities as others
2029448 we urgently need to address the widening gap between rich and poor we want to allow good new schools to set up in poor areas based on the successful swedish model so that every parent gets the opportunity for their child that is currently only open to the rich
2029449 the tory claims are not accurate it is a manipulation of figures anyone who works in education knows that as a result of investment sixfold in real terms in school buildings for example things have improved most significantly for those who need it the tories arent coming forward with credible policies
2029450 i simply cant see that the swedish style free market model is going to make the difference that they say
2029451 weve had a number of victims approach us and advise us that they were assaulted beaten with weapons tortured because of money the owed
2029452 we have a number of forcible confinement charges awaiting approval and this incident was being added to those charges
2029453 they are connected through the organized crime drug trade and we could be dealing with some of the same players in some of the charges that are pending and they are all connected to the independent soldiers
2029454 when you are shackled in the basement of a building you could imagine the fear of not knowing when the torture will end the psychological fear is something that is used on the victim
2029455 the rcmp felt they certainly had success with their focus on crack shacks
2029456 but again it causes some other things to happen such as trafficking in parking lots they move to cellular phones and trafficking in parking lots
2029457 see what gartner has said about hps business continuity amp availability services
2029458 the government and the tsk decided to defer expulsions to avoid conspiracy theories that the expelled officers had links to the ergenekon gang the second reason behind this deferment is the governments will to speed up the eu harmonization process
2029459 the general staff was extra cautious about not giving rise to speculation that the officers expelled from the army have ties with the ergenekon gang the general staff proposed that the government defer military expulsions to the ya meetings in november aware of the general staffs sensitivity on the issue the government accepted the proposal and postponed the discussion on expulsions to november
2029460 most of these officers belong to the turkish naval forces and the gendarmerie general command
2029461 a paramount studios publicist called me requesting clift hotel accommodations for novak james stewart and director alfred hitchcock
2029462 my creative juices went into overdrive and her suite had lavender bath soap telephone and silk bedsheets her guest flower bouquet included white and lavender iris
2029463 hitchcock became overly enamored with the vertiginous beauty of frisco its questionable whether that much time should be devoted to what is basically only a psychological murder mystery
2029464 i was intrigued by the heros attempts to recreate the image of a dead woman through another one whos alive
2029465 san francisco is a marvelous city to shoot a story like this theres one sequence where jimmy is tailing kim around union square she parks her car and then walks down a rather sinister alley entering a small door off it jimmy follows then he finds shes merely gone into podestas florist shop from a rear entrance
2029466 miss novak arrived on the set with all sorts of preconceived notions that i couldnt possibly go along with
2029467 i went to kim novaks dressing room and told her about the dresses and hairdos that i had been planning for months
2029468 his original idea was to do a set in hollywood but he was a fanatic for detail and he wanted this tile floor and he couldnt duplicate it kim novak was very nice we sent lavender flowers to her room
2029469 we came back from shopping to find the back door smashed in and on the kitchen work top
2029470 the police here didnt tell us much so i went to the station to ask why
2029471 but when i told the desk sergeant i didnt know who they were looking for they just werent interested
2029472 when i came home i noticed the fridge magnets had been rearranged and said oldham task force called
2029473 these are for children theyre not for the police to leave a message theyve raided your house
2029474 it makes me feel theyre treating me like some sort of scruff basically something on the bottom of their shoe and theyre laughing at me
2029475 i dont find it a laughing matter when my two year old son is in bed with a wooden door that can easily be pulled off every night
2029476 my son cant play in the back garden and ive had to write to the chief constable to ask for a new door i want a written apology so i can show it to my neighbours
2029477 i only moved into the street 11 days ago because its a quiet area so ive had to go round to my neighbours and explain im not an idiot or a criminal
2029478 the back door boarded up makes it look like a crack house
2029479 i work for a living we try hard to keep our heads above water with the baby and everything so i dont want to be treated like a scruff who hangs about on the streets all day
2029480 acting on the basis of intelligence officers entered the house as part of a search for a wanted man who had been recalled to prison
2029481 if you have authorization then the school should be allowed to open it is bad practice to throw a spanner into the works for your fellow citizens one should work with the citizens not against them
2029482 why should you have to ask the competition when it comes to the founding of schools you dont ask coop konsum if they would like ica to open a store or not
2029483 i tugged them up and there was this loud pop
2029484 the doctor said he was thinking of my long term interests and whats best for my survival
2029485 i told him so was i and im not going
2029486 hes a good sized safety hes a physical guy right now and by the time he stays in the weight room hes going to be even more so hes got good speed hes an intelligent guy i think hes going to really be a good player before he gets through here
2029487 but im going to come in with the mentality of earning a spot so ill just go all out and if the coaches want to redshirt me thats fine that just gives me an extra year to get better and work hard
2029488 his current status is it looks like hes going to be ineligible so hes last team
2029489 i dont know if theyll appeal it or whatever and if they do and if thats granted then he might move up from there but right now were not going to waste reps on him until we know something
2029490 im just very excited about what i can do and what the team can do for me im just ready to make it happen academically and on the field

2029492 web 2 0 with their new modernista com destination i think this has to be the gutsiest web strategy ive seen specially when considering its from an ad agency
2029493 user generated content is having a massive impact on the internet
2029494 there is a huge appetite for services which allow consumers to create and customize their own content mixibodz allows users to create multiple versions of themselves dressed posed and animated differently and then use these avatars in different locations on their social networking sites on their mobile phone or on their own blog the content posted includes a mobile sending application that allows users to download and send each others creations from their profile pages it gives the user creative control over their online identity and its a lot of fun
2029495 the mobile delivery feature within the mixibodz site introduces a whole new level of interaction for avatar applications
2029496 users can send one of the animated avatars to their friends complete with an attached message the recipient can then save the animation and use it as a wallpaper ring alert or screen saver it moves the avatar outside the purely online world and into the users every day life
2029497 weve had some really great ideas while building the site and weve already started to get some fantastic feedback from users were going to be introducing some very cool new capabilities and concepts in the near future so watch this space

2029514 having dishonestly agreed with others to make or implement arrangements which directly or indirectly fixed the price for the supply in the united kingdom of passenger air transport services by british airways and virgin atlantic airways
2029515 at the time of these events iain burns was the head of pr at british airways with no responsibility for pricing decisions given his very high level of cooperation to the oft iain is naturally disappointed with their decision however he hopes that it will allow this case to be fully analysed before a court and finally provide him with the opportunity to clear his name

2029522 ping and i were honored to be invited by the chinese minister of education to attend the opening ceremonies as his guests
2029523 in addition to this gesture of friendship we are pleased to be there with other rice community members who are attending the games as athletes and coaches rice will be well represented at this olympiad
2029524 rice university enjoys a high reputation in the u s and the world
2029525 broad exchanges and research ties have been established between rice and chinese universities the vision and efforts of president leebron make the enhanced educational exchanges possible
2029526 if as some kind of gesture we said no to new coal fired power stations we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this technology ourselves it requires some new coal powered fire stations for the technology to develop
2029527 world demand for coal is projected to rise by 70 by 2030 an average annual rate of 2 2 and the bulk of the rise will come from india and china
2029528 china is a nation built on coal so the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
2029529 we are responsible for 2 of emissions worldwide and we have a duty to tackle that
2029530 but the real gain here the real challenge and if we do not meet the challenge all is lost on global warming the stakes are that high is to bring on clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage
2029531 once we can develop those technologies we can help the chinese the indians and others to retrofit power stations and make ccs a component of new coal fired power stations that is the only way we are going to tackle this problem
2029532 if we were to have a moratorium on coal fired stations we would therefore most likely become more dependent on gas
2029533 i dont want to exaggerate but gas comes from some fairly unstable parts of the world and some not readily associated with human rights and democracy
2029534 i think if we did that at the moment when we do not know 100 that ccs is going to work the engineering has not yet been tested and no one is fully aware of what the costs might be then that would put an end to coal fired power stations and demonstration plant and people would build gas again
2029535 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
2029536 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
2029537 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
2029538 desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
2029539 that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family for decades weve had politicians in washington who talk about family values but we havent had policies that value families instead its harder for working parents to make a living while raising their kids its even harder to get a break

2029563 an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2029564 the bush administration has consistently supported the unborn however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
2029565 legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience
2029566 several months ago i became aware that certain medical specialty certification groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortion i wrote to the organizations in question protesting their actions frankly i found their response to be dodgy and unsatisfying i sent another letter more of the same
2029567 patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
2029568 very quickly the original intent of sec leavitt becomes everyones right to withhold services because the person seeking it doesnt believe exactly the same things as the person providing it

2029570 what virtue is fundamental to the achievement of those values
2029571 whatever else may be thought about hitlers exploits they are among the most remarkable in the whole history of the world
2029572 it is a long term problem and requires a long term solution the city needs a concerted comprehensive policy to address this issue and it should be a priority for whoever assumes the leadership role in omaha in 2009
2029573 you shouldnt count me as a candidate for mayor ive been approached i thought about it but im really focused on my legislative agenda which includes immigration and violence and those are tough issues
2029574 small cheap cellphones have become ubiquitous in the workplace but federal tax rules governing them date to the days of big handsets big bills and big hair
2029575 the movie sees three thrill seeking strippers encountering a young couple in the desert spears character murders the boyfriend with her bare hands before taking the girlfriend hostage the troubled singer will also have sex scenes with another girl before the drama ends in a blood bath

2029596 we want to help children understand very early in their lives the impact of gods word and its outgrowth of giving through his church and this guide is a first class effort by so many to do just that
2029597 without this support from north carolina baptist churches we could not continue our ministry with the same ever expanding focus which we now employ in our work north carolina baptists should consider the ncmo the lifeblood for our ministry
2029598 to effectively congregationalize new believers is not only a command of the lord jesus christ but we are finding that the assistance we provide to existing congregations to develop a church planting mentality actually helps renew churches in their great commission task of reaching their world for christ
2029599 alongside the cooperative program and the national mission offerings of the southern baptist convention the ncmo stands as a vital source of intentional engagement with the culture of our state
2029600 the genius of the cooperative program and the ncmo is the multiplication factor which brings together churches from different regions of the state and forms a gospel alliance to accomplish together what they could never do alone
2029601 it provides the means whereby this state convention can expand and develop new ways of accomplishing eternal goals through a systematic method of research and development that many other denominations do not possess
2029602 our focus as north carolina baptists remains centered on the solid foundation of the gospel of jesus christ as revealed in the bible
2029603 but our providential advantage as a convention of churches is the strength we hold together as we learn from one another grow together and have the monetary means to actually reach out in new ways of church planting new associational partnerships and attempt new projects without the fear of compromising the solid stability that has come to exemplify north carolina baptists the north carolina missions offering helps us to do just that to the glory of the lord

2029625 if only i could do more to bolster the self esteem of this group theyd be less likely to sodomize themselves to death perhaps i could fasten down my fear of the negro long enough to flirt with these black homosexuals and show them the same interest i used to show my dear mates when i was a lad perhaps i could offer myself as some sort of lily white sacrifice to to the primitive embrace of jungle love perhaps i could invite some of these saucy blackamoors over to my hovel where we could watch the type of ultra feminine movies im always crowing about like a fair dinkum jackdaw or perhaps i could just wank off to some gay black pornography in any case its a win win scenario mainly for me mates
2029626 mom you need to get with the program dont you know video blogging is all the rage

2029632 the frequency of these images and references dont make any sense unless youre trying to send the message that obama could be the antichrist
2029633 if they wanted to be funny if they really wanted to play up the idea that obama thinks hes the second coming there were better ways to do it
2029634 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
2029635 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
2029636 now that theyve met me they can see i dont have two horns and a tail
2029637 i feel for anyone trying to sell homes in the current market including sawtooth
2029638 but for them to ask the court to pin sawtooths inability to sell their modular homes on a couple of bloggers and regular homeowners is incredulous
2029639 i think if his business has been hurt its been his business practices that hurt it i believe some call it karma didnt have smooth sailing with our subdivision so he has to go after us individually

2029642 these are the first gdp figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2029643 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavourable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2029644 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent
2029645 a full fledged adjustment phase has begun for the euro
2029646 players who have been bullish on the euro are now unwinding long buy positions
2029647 their economies are losing growth momentum and the central banks there are signalling a near term rate cut
2029648 terrorism continues to rear its ugly head in our region
2029649 the isi is waiting for the opportunity to launch cross border terrorism
2029650 terrorist attacks are a rapidly growing threat not just to afghanistan or india but for the entire saarc region
2029651 india can offer a lot to afghanistan in the training of our personnel in various fields at their security institutions
2029652 this rivalry goes a long way to explaining why saarc has spectacularly failed in its main task promoting regional economic integration according to a world bank report released last year south asia is the least integrated region in the world trade between saarcs members accounted for less than 2 percent of their combined gdp

2029654 after 25 great years i just felt i was getting a bit stale and it was time to try something else
2029655 hosting the games is in the context of the united states like having two super bowls every day for 16 days
2029656 every one of these is building new subways new airports new stadiums and new commercial buildings
2029657 all this top security technology is being employed for the olympics
2029658 the question is what happens to it and how is it used after the games

2029669 on the world cup we had tremendous results with ted and lindsey taking titles as well as a first world cup win by marco and podium performances by julia scott and steven this positions the team well and gives us great momentum going into the 2009 world championship season
2029670 jim is returning to lead a very powerful womens team he has the experience and staff in place to keep the momentum going and this will be invaluable as we prepare for the big events in the coming seasons
2029671 sasha has demonstrated great leadership skills as a head coach at the european and world cup levels the athletes and staff are all excited to see him take over the leadership responsibilities of the team
2029672 bode had great success last year with his own program and we expect that to continue
2029673 while our primary focus is on the athletes training in our u s ski team program we want to also support bode in achieving his success
2029674 while these top athletes didnt qualify by the team selection criteria we want to make our camps and coaching available to them to be as prepared as possible for the season
2029675 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
2029676 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
2029677 were going against the same defense over and over these days and theyre kind of ready to hit someone new and i think thats the way the rest of the offense feels
2029678 encourage creative and continuously varied compositions that tax physiological functions against every realistically conceivable combination of stressors
2029679 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2029680 the bulldogs will continue to stand up for whats right for the club and continue to stand up for the principle and sanctity of the contract
2029681 im no coward you know i stood up for myself and i stood up for player rights

2029685 weeroom is the next step in evolving the unique weeworld experience similar to the rest of the site weeroom is focused on creative self expression beautiful iconic design and a simple almost infinitely configurable interface
2029686 they have many layers in our past games weve tried to show that shrek is more than a ferocious apparently scottish ogre hes a hero with a heart too shrek the third carries on this proud tradition and gives players the chance to get even with the fairy tale villains of their childhood with a well aimed handful of mud
2029687 were here today to announce a nonannouncement more experiments and time are needed to resolve the results of the science experiments
2029688 opening a window to allow the public to see the scientific process in action
2029689 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
2029690 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
2029691 we found oxygen on mars and possibly a bit of rocket fuel
2029692 what benefit can i be to my country for the millions wasted on my education
2029693 anyone we might find evidence of primitive life forms if not an advanced civilization or outpost of intelligent life
2029694 low cal brownies made out of canned pumpkin among other ingredients they were pretty gross
2029695 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
2029696 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
2029697 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
2029698 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
2029699 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
2029700 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
2029701 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
2029702 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
2029703 can best be described as a design and usability ethnographer he explores the way mobile phones are used worldwide and reports back to nokias design team hes a fascinating person to talk to and i thought i might highlight some of the stories hes come up with while exploring in africa
2029704 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
2029705 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog beijing organizing committee of the 2008 olympic games or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
2029706 dear china your air is dirty and we deeply regret having to breathe it sincerely the u s cycling team

2029716 the sweetest little nazi in the history of the cinema
2029717 i believe the answer to some of the concerns on this string is that the novel movie is really a semi surrealistic allegory about the inglorious role played by most of the czech people during world war ii surrendered without firing a shot for the most part collaborated or just went about their business provided minimum help to jewish victims etc dont look for redemption because there wasnt any
2029718 this shit gotta be fuckin big yall its gotta be some global blowout shit this shit gotta have some symbolism to it sustenance this shit gotta be like fuckin john carlos and tommie smith at the 68 olympics know what im saying put the fists up some big shit

2029721 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
2029722 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire
2029723 and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2029724 we condemn chinas reluctance to resolve the tibetan issue despite the riots and death of hundreds of innocents and the absence of palpable measures taken by international bodies
2029725 tibetans in the city would wear black clothes as a sign of protest and will switch off electricity in their residences from 8 pm to 9 pm throughout the olympic games
2029726 we want to take the threadless com model and expand it into other businesses
2029727 with the benefit of hindsight we were wrong the department was wrong and the prosecutor was right
2029728 a little investigation and i come to see that it was all a load of particularly sleazy crap but the question remains will the press corps have the wherewithal to realize that or to be able to tell when theyre being
2029729 why is she releasing altered documents and trying to pass them off as originals
2029730 the burlington free press did not report that she filed separately but did state mistakenly that the forms symington provided were the actual tax returns she filed

2029732 partnering with automakers like mitsubishi is vital to developing compatible infrastructures
2029733 we are hoping for the opportunity to introduce the small four passenger mitsubishi i miev to pg amp es fleet in the fourth quarter of this year so that we can begin real world u s testing the joint partnership will yield valuable data and a greater appreciation of the practicality of an all electric vehicle in california
2029734 pg amp e has been researching the benefits of electric vehicles since the nineties partnering with automakers like mitsubishi is vital to developing compatible infrastructures to support electric vehicles in the marketplace and ensure responsible integration with the grid
2029735 by working with mitsubishi we will both benefit from a free exchange of electric vehicle information that includes charging infrastructure availability vehicle data vehicle commercialization expectations and public feedback
2029736 the small four passenger mitsubishi i mievs will enter into sces nationally recognized prototype testing and evaluation program this collaboration with one of the nations leading utility supporters of electric vehicles will provide us technical feedback on i miev vehicle and battery performance as well as vehicle connection and integration into the electrical system
2029737 southern california edison has more than 20 years and 16 million ev miles of experience operating the nations largest private fleet of electric vehicles
2029738 this new ev collaboration with mitsubishi complements sces existing work on plug in hybrids and next generation advanced batteries and their effective connection and control by edisons next generation meters
2029739 the development and production of next generation fuel sources is essential for the car industry as a whole and for mitsubishi to lead the way exemplifies our commitment to new green technology

2029741 these latest figures show that graduate job prospects continue to improve as more and more employers require the wide range of skills that graduates bring to their business
2029742 graduates can expect to earn considerably more over their careers than those without a degree with the average graduate earning comfortably more than 100 000 over their lifetime in todays valuation and net of tax compared to someone who just has a levels
2029743 it is good news that graduate employability is rising but it would be helpful to have more detailed figures about employment a few years after graduation with more information about the types of jobs being undertaken
2029744 obviously graduates with certain degree subjects and classifications will find employment sooner than others however it is worth noting that all subjects result in over 90 of graduates finding employment within six months
2029745 overall this is really good news for prospective and current students
2029746 the true picture of graduate employment is likely to be even better than reported today as many graduates will choose to opt for postgraduate study or take somewhat longer to find the job of their dreams
2029747 the benefits of a university experience are vast and should not be reduced merely to employment status six months after leaving
2029748 the figures do suggest that hard work at university is rewarded on graduation as students with higher degrees appear more likely to find work
2029749 citi understands the challenges facing consumers in todays economic environment
2029750 by working closely with mastercard and exxonmobil we were able to enhance the value proposition of our exxonmobil co branded card to deliver a card with strong consumer appeal offering cents per gallon gasoline rebates allowing consumers to easily calculate their savings and offering a competitive annual percentage rate with no annual fee
2029751 in an effort to offer one of the most competitive programs in the industry this unique new card differentiates us from the competition and will continue to drive customer loyalty for our exxon and mobil locations nationwide
2029752 it is remarkable that the oath ceremony containing pledges of violence took place in mersin in which there was a sharp increase in the population of kurdish citizens who migrated from the eastern part of turkey another formation of the ergenekon terror organization in the category of civil society organization is the association for the union of patriotic forces vkgb which urged the local villagers in mersin to engage in war with the claim that mersin was under the control of the outlawed kurdistan workers party pkk within this context they tried to organize mass demonstrations and protests in the city
2029753 actually my clients were detained by a police anti terror team they mentioned the man with the suit to the police they even pointed him out in pictures taken of the demonstrations according to my clients the police detained the man in the suit and presented him to them they made a positive identification of him but interestingly neither their detention nor their identification of the man was recorded my clients 48 hours after they were detained were transferred to the juvenile crime unit and the official records of their detention started from that point
2029754 it is a very well known fact that the flag demonstration in mersin was seen as even more provocative after the attempts at flag burning in 2005 at the nevruz celebrations the association vkgb selected mersin as the pilot site especially because of the efforts of mesut sezer the chairman of the mersin branch
2029755 this is an independence war and everyone carrying turkish blood has to participate in this war
2029756 there were 4 000 soldiers in the mersin demonstration no one was aware of it
2029757 first we made the soldiers march then civilians participated and we withdrew the soldiers
2029758 our party wants to know who put the flags in the hands of children and for what purpose
2029759 some of the families did not have the money to hire a lawyer the bar association tried to appoint lawyers for them but some lawyers refused to take the case there was an investigation into it but nothing came of it the children were forced to pass through x ray machines we complained about this treatment too they were under arrest for four months and now all of them are out of school and working in temporary jobs
2029760 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant coal can provide usable energy at a cost of between 1 and 2 0 52 to 1 04 per million british thermal units mmbtu compared to 6 to 12 per mmbtu for oil and natural gas
2029761 the character and ambience of the lovely old market town is being diminished by men wearing unattractive dirty baggy unseemly shorts sometimes even with socks
2029762 if people have a modicum of decency and common sense they would realise it is inappropriate in every town
2029763 as far as ladies go its obviously a different matter they normally have attractive lovely legs and are an asset to the town in summer its always a pleasure to see them wearing dresses and shorts which are beautifully tailored clean and elegant
2029764 it is another example of the sort of louts and ill mannered people who are increasingly visiting knutsford in a minority and causing drunken behaviour damage and occasionally assaults peoples moral and physical behaviour are linked
2029765 shorts are often accompanied by collarless t shirts or vests or even no shirt at all is this another nail in the coffin of the rapidly downward spiral of our once lovely town
2029766 its perfectly legitimate to wear shorts on holiday in the south of france where there are other cosmopolitan holidaymakers equally in ones own private grounds i often not only wear shorts but walk around naked at my home which is completely secluded
2029767 even in boiling hot weather shorts are unacceptable people should do their shopping at a different time
2029768 the length doesnt matter three quarter length shorts are the worst a typical example of an inappropriate mode of dress it savagely detracts from my sense of wellbeing when i visit the town and see such ghastly sights i am dismayed
2029769 i wear my shorts from the beginning of february right through until the third week of october
2029770 but i suppose it depends on the style some people who wear shorts just look like pirates
2029771 i do get dressed up when i go out at night but i think shorts are fine when youre just going to the shops like i am today i cant really see the problem
2029772 i dont see a problem with men wearing shorts in the summer theyre not something that i wear every day anyway only when the weathers reasonable
2029773 knutsford is a nice place but i dont know how the fashion shops would go on if they only sold long trousers
2029774 what would happen next would you get arrested if you wore shorts
2029775 whoever said that about shorts should go to new zealand
2029776 ive just been there and you see men going to work in shorts a shirt and a tie they look very smart too
2029777 we wear shorts everywhere in australia i dont see what the problem is here
2029778 arise shine for your light has come and the glory of the rather than let the blog go un updated another day i decided to pull something out of the archives

2029787 women and girls especially young girls are the most unprotected people of afghanistan
2029788 this is just an example among thousands of other cases
2029789 women and girls especially young girls are the most unprotected people of afghanistan they are raped kidnapped and murdered
2029790 these criminals are never brought to justice because police and government authorities are either involved or they cant handle the crimes
2029791 with criminals and warlords in the political scene we cannot expect justice to be served
2029792 in many cases of violence against children there is a sense of impunity people continue to violate childrens rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable
2029793 afghan children raped with impunity sharia law prevents accusers from coming forward

2029796 the evidence is now in and that optimism was unwarranted recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity these conclusions are significant for evaluating the likely impact of sen barack obamas recent proposal to distribute 1 000 rebate checks to low and middle income workers at an estimated cost of approximately 65 billion his plan to finance those rebates with an extra tax on oil companies would reduce investment in refining and exploration keeping oil prices higher than they would otherwise be here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the pay down of debt for a more comprehensive picture we can see how households divided their overall increase in disposable personal income that is household income including the rebates and net of income taxes and payroll taxes between additional consumer outlays and saving the official gdp figures show that disposable personal income increased between the first and second quarters by some 98 billion one fourth of the annualized figure of 393 billion shown in the government report up from an increase of 22 billion between the final quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 so disposable personal income rose by an additional 76 billion a bit less than the rebates because of declining employment and reductions in other sources of income the corresponding rise in consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of disposable personal income by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much

2029820 on the way up the last 2 000 feet a serbian climber fell to his death and a pakistani porter died trying to recover his body and on the way back a chunk of glacier splintered and came crashing down sweeping at least four climbers on ropes to their deaths and leaving a handful of others trapped in the death zone above 26 000 feet desperately cold starved for oxygen and without ropes
2029821 if you cant go down you have to climb up
2029822 so in such a difficult situation you are taking more risks youre climbing more technical slopes and finally you make a little mistake and youre gone

2029873 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
2029874 it is the abuse of this by politicians and leaders that have been bribed or corrupted but that does not mean that other civil servants have all fallen into the trap there are many more that work quietly behind the scenes to keep the civil service in fiji performing and survive the rat race and coup culture
2029875 no wonder many of them would rather leave the service and look elsewhere where they are appreciated and respected
2029876 this is excellent and will encourage dialogue among all the people of fiji
2029877 the common identity is a good idea as we all get confused when we are called fijian at international events and conferences so it would be good not to have to painstakingly explain and justifty out fragmented identities all the time
2029878 i do not support the placement of an lng facility in the middle of long island sound long island sound is our yellowstone it would be unthinkable to site an industrial facility in the middle of it
2029879 rejecting this back door attack on the arctic national wildlife refuge and voting to protect this incomparable wilderness
2029880 for the very first time im able to create superheroes in the fantastic japanese manga style thanks to my lucky partnership with the great hiroyuki takei what a kick itll be to join hiroyuki san in offering brand new action packed stories to an army of readers in both the eastern and western worlds
2029881 word of ultimos development and subsequent debut in japan led many domestic fans to wonder when they would get a chance to read it so were very excited to offer the north american debut in the upcoming september issue of shonen jump
2029882 ultimo was developed as a true collaboration with stan lee sending his initial story idea to takei san who developed artwork and characters and reworked the plot to fit into the japanese manga storytelling style the result is something extremely compelling and we invite everyone to check out this historic release in our upcoming issue
2029883 h con res 362 calls for a blockade of iran which i am totally opposed to until all diplomatic options are fully exhausted
2029884 the lesson to be learned from the iraq war which i opposed form the beginning is that we should not rush to imprudent actions when it comes to world diplomacy
2029885 a blockade is an act of war and i do not believe we have reached that point with iran
2029886 i strongly oppose the ongoing war in iraq and support efforts to prevent president bush from launching a military attack on iran while we must ensure the safety and security of israel we should first use all of our economic political and diplomatic tools to achieve our objectives of dissembling irans nuclear program and building peace and security in the region and around the world even though there are many aspects to h con res 362 that do outline a path of putting diplomacy first i would not vote for this resolution because this president cannot be trusted with the additional authority granted by congress
2029887 i believe that iran is a destabilizing force in the middle east and that the best way to confront this influence is through a spirited diplomatic effort in conjunction with our allies my concern is that the language of the resolution could open the door to a blockade or other military action that will further destabilize the region
2029888 for months ive called for a reduction of tensions through increased diplomacy with iran to lower oil prices and ensure compliance with the nuclear non proliferation treaty
2029889 i welcome the recent policy shifts by this administration including the sending of undersecretary of state william burns to geneva and the announcement of establishing a us interest section in tehran
2029890 i am pleased to see that my opponents have recently joined me in opposing the bush administrations approach to iran i have repeatedly called for the need of this administration to resolve these issues through diplomatic means it is no coincidence that after this administration announced new diplomatic measures oil prices went down by nearly 30 per barrel this drop in oil prices underscores the benefits of increasing diplomatic contacts with iran the bush administration must exhaust all diplomatic options with iran before imposing further sanctions
2029891 iran is a threat to the stability of the middle east and a nuclear iran is a threat to world peace u s military and naval forces must remain on station in the middle east withdrawal from iraq is not an option so long as iran poses the threat it does
2029892 we should be very careful not to pass anything that bush could interrupt as giving him authority to use military force in dealing with iran
2029893 whether its albany or washington the system is broken because lobbyists and special interests have a stranglehold on our government
2029894 on the national level barack obama has put the issue of the influence of lobbyists at the forefront lobbyists are writing our energy policies lobbyists are holding up a national healthcare policy the same holds true for albany
2029895 we need a representative in washington who is not beholden to these powerful special interests
2029896 the people should be represented by someone who will put their interests first and who wont let lobbyists drown out their voices
2029897 while there certainly are lobbyists who champion progressive causes we need to revamp the whole system because our government is broken
2029898 too much money is changing hands behind the scenes in and around government for special favors increased access or to kill a piece of legislation
2029899 i promise to you the citizens of upstate new york i will
2029900 i believe that congress should serve our interests not powerful lobbying interests
2029901 theres a lot of important issues that need to be discussed and paul isnt complacent by any stretch of the imagination
2029902 with upstate seniors and families having difficulty filling up their gas tanks paying higher taxes and buying simple necessities like groceries and prescription drugs it is very clear that we as a nation have to shift our priorities back home and invest in middle class tax relief and our families this new report is a stunning reminder of this administrations incompetence we need to make the iraqis take a greater role in rebuilding their country so we can bring our troops home sooner
2029903 energy is the most important issue facing our nation right now and paul tonko has the experience and expertise that we need on capitol hill
2029904 we strongly urge voters in the 21st district to cast their votes for a cleaner more affordable energy future by making paul tonko their next member of congress
2029905 i am thrilled to be receiving the endorsement of the new york league of conservation voters the nylcv has been a leader in protecting new yorks environmental treasures and in pushing for a sustainable policy focused on renewable energy sources as congressman for the 21st district i will make it a priority to work with the nylcv fellow members of congress and the president to develop a sound national energy plan that will preserve our environment strengthen our economy and guarantee a bright future for our children
2029906 perhaps lack of clear understanding of the election law haste and careless in gathering signatures numerous minor errors by witnesses and signers alike but no fraud

2029912 i am proud to be able to share some of my biography and positions on the issues through the mass media to be able to produce and run a television ad demonstrates my ability to win this primary and will further my name recognition so that i am in the best position to be elected in the general election
2029913 i am now able to focus on my grassroots efforts of going door to door and communicating with the voters my message of being the best candidate to support issues that matter to working families and my determination to stand up for what is right
2029914 its been a pleasure contributing my time and energy to gnu and the foundation over the last three years and i will miss everyone at the fsf and having the chance to work with gnu hackers all over the world
2029915 web apps are great and im in love with them but i think its time to ask for more freedom and more privacy here is a three step plan to achieve both these results
2029916 levi was gonna stay home but then he said dad mom i wanna go support moms purses

2029919 there is no magic number of soldiers that are needed on the ground to win this campaign
2029920 what we need is security of the people we need governance we need reconstruction and development
2029921 unless you stabilize that border with pakistan and uproot the terrorist safe haven that has developed in the pakistan tribal areas youre not going to be able to stabilize afghanistan
2029922 ninety percent of the worlds opium comes from afghanistan and much of that money ends up in the hands of warlords and other militants
2029923 there is a clear linkage between narco trafficking and financing of the insurgency
2029924 there is a sense of commitment from those troops and when they go in for the fight they go in with everything theyve got
2029925 if passengers are booking ahead of the 80 seat target we will close off the cheap seats if we are booking behind it we will open up more cheap fares
2029926 ultimately it is oil and the operating losses that will force some of these guys to the wall
2029927 we will dump the price to wherever it needs to be in order to get to 80
2029928 if airlines get a break in the oil price some of them will get financing from some idiot the more expensive oil is the faster we roll up the loss making companies that are not going to survive anyway
2029929 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2029930 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2029931 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2029932 i noticed many people here do not respect local brits or even respect the country they come here without having an idea about our culture and religion and all that they think about is how much salary they will take we as a british people feel worried about the thousands of foreigners we try to be open with others but if they respect our culture and our land e g speak english celebrate xmas and wear our clothes what do u think
2029933 im qatari this is my airline i dont pay excess
2029934 it is an irony that we build these residential apartments and dont have a roof to sleep under
2029935 my company did provide me with accommodation when i landed here in january but the rooms were overcrowded 12 in one room and the food quality was horrendous we simply decided to live out in the open rather than the hell my company calls accommodation the decision is solely ours
2029936 how are we supposed to live together with people who have religious and cultural habits diametrically opposed to ours
2029937 there is a remarkable difference in our bathroom habits food tastes and living style all of which we were forced to share
2029938 we have also made a makeshift bathroom onsite while our clothes and bedding gets bundled up every morning and tucked into a brick made storage space
2029939 the winters are tolerable in the open but now half the night is wasted scratching my skin due to heat rashes for most of the time we just pretend to each other that we are sleeping and gaze at the stars
2029940 we like our arab speaking qatari brothers its the construction firms that maltreat us actually thats an understatement they treat us like animals im just an employee a number to my company
2029941 if u want to see the change in world make a change in yourself first
2029942 actually i find expatriates are very respectful of qatari culture you might get a few that arent but you wil also get a few from qatari culture that arent respectful
2029943 let ppl respect us after that we will respect others
2029944 forcing someone to convert to be allowed to marry one of their citizans
2029945 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2029946 if were going to continue to see weaponization that is used in conflicts like afghanistan and iraq put on the canada u s border saying that its required for safety and security it really changes the nature of our relationship
2029947 no regrets no regrets at all yeah disney offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself
2029948 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2029949 its inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye
2029950 so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
2029951 they want those leaders to confirm the fact that china has returned to great power prominence in the world
2029952 they really want to say to the people of china that we the communist party of china have done a great job
2029953 we did not act like turks we found the logical and the sensible way
2029954 how does the structure of a picture affect our emotional response
2029955 the two sides will assess the trend of cooperation between the iranian atomic energy organization and the iaea
2029956 so what do you need our help with get to the point already
2029957 not now when we get a house a better job move to a new place save more etc

2029964 more reports of local muslim clerics referring people to the taliban in part because of their commitment to shariah or islamic law
2029965 a new position gives you a golden opportunity to shine observe whats going on around you assess the situation adjust your objectives determine your needs and draft a plan to meet them before taking any actions
2029966 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech that he gave in 2002
2029967 hillary clinton was making a strong and valid argument for why john mccain will be the next president
2029968 in this case we couldnt have said it better ourselves
2029969 a job well done deserves a proper reward right but in collaborative efforts such as agile development can you single out individual efforts without killing the teams morale and productivity
2029970 great design is intuitive great design eliminates confusion but not for everyone not all the time
2029971 the ftc submitted that the public service regulations fully encompass all matters of discipline and the code of conduct
2029972 inclusion of this in the boards portfolio would be duplication you cannot have two separate trials for one offence registration fee this matter was discussed at length and the unions proposed a fee of 20 a year
2029973 the unions are very disturbed to hear the ministry is meeting with members and instructing them to fill in registration forms with the intention of implementing it without any change to the draft discussed with unions
2029974 please note if this continues we will advise our members not to register until the unions have agreed to the document
2029975 it is negative attitude on their part and will only harden our side as well which will not help in the long run
2029976 on one hand they are seeking our co operation while on the other hand they are making unilateral decisions
2029977 the form now says that we have to 82 50 which includes 22 50 for police clearance 10 for registration and 50 for the year
2029978 we have to pay 82 50 per year but for three years 182 50 it is a three year term
2029979 apart from this student teachers who come for their practical also have to have about half of 82 50 and they offer us free services
2029980 according to the forms we receive if we have a complaint to lodge we have to 20 and thats silly
2029981 my concern is that the psc is still our employer as principals we will have to go to the psc but we normally only do that if we suspect that a teacher does not have a certification
2029982 there are students who come in from england during their gap year and they work for free now they and other student teachers doing practical have to pay a certain amount
2029983 we are planning to conduct a full and thorough investigation
2029984 inadvertently killing four women and a child located with them

2029987 it is true his holiness did not wish to meet president sarkozy during his trip of august 2008 since these are the dates of the olympic games in beijing which his holiness has supported in a consistent and coherent manner
2029988 penalised ongoing talks between the tibetan and chinese parties as well as the situation in tibet which remains very tense
2029989 but his holiness sincerely wishes to meet him and president sarkozy has the sincere wish and intention to meet
2029990 we are working with president sarkozys staff to set up a meeting this year but at a later date
