8990170 o senador mccain gosta de falar de julgamento mas sinceramente o que o julgamento dele quer dizer se ele acha que george bush tinha raz o em mais de 90 dos casos
8990171 n o acho que o senador mccain desdenhe do que acontece com a vida dos americanos acho simplesmente que ele n o sabe o que acontece

8990211 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics

8990215 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8990216 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8990217 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8990218 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8990219 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8990220 jeff the markets are playing a game of your economys worse than mine and that might be true in that i mean the eurozone economy might be slowing worse than the u s even though i highly doubt it but for this discussion ill play along when the dust settles the united states had a recession and the eurozone did too but in the end the u s is still saddled with all this debt a credit crisis and a housing market circling the bowl i just dont see how that is a good thing for the dollar
8990221 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8990222 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8990223 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8990224 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
8990225 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
8990226 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
8990227 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
8990228 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
8990229 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
8990230 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
8990231 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
8990232 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance

8990239 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8990240 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8990241 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8990242 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8990243 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8990244 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8990245 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8990246 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8990247 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8990248 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8990249 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8990250 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8990251 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8990252 a boa not cia que o processo est funcionando e j estamos vendo os sinais de que a infla o est convergindo para o centro da meta
8990253 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8990254 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8990255 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8990256 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8990257 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8990258 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8990259 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8990260 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8990261 who are open to doing something on the production side
8990262 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8990263 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8990264 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8990265 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8990266 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8990267 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8990268 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8990269 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8990270 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8990271 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8990272 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8990273 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8990274 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8990275 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8990276 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8990277 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8990278 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8990279 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8990280 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8990281 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8990282 small town kid he wants to be a plumber he ends up winning this mario bros competition and i wouldnt make it a bad movie
8990283 it could be this boy in a suburban area who really wants to steal cars and relentlessly murder pedestrians instead he plays a video game with this same premise eventually winning a tournament and i wouldnt make it a bad movie
8990284 it could be about this child living in a non metropolitan area has dreams of becoming a sarcastic anthropomorphic hedgehog with the ability to run extremely fast and curl himself into a perfect sphere capable of destroying the droid forces of the evil dr robotnik about how he wins a sonic the hedgehog video game tournament also i dont intentionally make it a bad film
8990285 i havent played that but the movie would be whatever the plot of
8990286 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8990287 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8990288 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8990289 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8990290 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8990291 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8990292 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8990293 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8990294 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8990295 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8990296 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8990297 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8990298 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8990299 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8990300 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8990301 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees

8990310 i am the only republican who is not a corrupt hypocrite of mindbending proportions
8990311 i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8990312 my ancestors didnt pay russia 7 2 million not to drill oil in this state
8990313 yes i made a choice and it is still a choice in this country to give birth to a son who by definition will never be able to pull himself up by those bootstraps barack obama was talking about last night
8990314 ive been in search for the right words and the closest thing that i can come up with is surreal
8990315 i had not seen him convey that kind of commitment he seemed to be operating from a place of strength
8990316 back then you would be viewed differently if you showed anger
8990317 you could be angry but you had to show that you were not dangerous especially if you were a black man
8990318 for a black person to say back then that im going to run for president would be like someone saying im going to walk to mars
8990319 i knew then that this was going to be something
8990320 it started getting good mahalia jackson started rocking and rolling with him it got inspired
8990321 people started calling from everywhere they thought it was great
8990322 king is the son of the segregated south obama is the son of integrated hawaii
8990323 king is a preacher and obama is a law professor no one would think of comparing the two if they werent both black
8990324 they both faced the task of introducing themselves to a potentially skeptical audience
8990325 i never thought in my lifetime that i would see one of us aspiring to be the head of our nation
8990326 mr obama leading us toward the presidency is like the promised land for us
8990327 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8990328 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8990329 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8990330 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8990333 only three years after hurricanes katrina and rita devastated gulf of mexico oil and gas production an emerging hurricane storm is tracking another potentially lethal swath through americas energy heartland
8990334 and with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon

8990340 instead of opposing magic and science it would be better to compare them as two parallel modes of acquiring knowledge their theoretical and practical results differ in value as science is certainly more successful than magic from this point of view although magic foreshadows science in that it also sometimes works but both science and magic require the same sort of mental operations which differ not so much in kind as in the different types of phenomena to which they are applied these relations are a consequence of the objective conditions in which magic and scientific knowledge appeared the history of the latter is short enough for us to know a good deal about it but the fact that modern science dates back only a few centuries raises a problem which ethnologiests have not yet sufficiently pondered the neolithic paradox would be a suitable name for it

8990366 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
8990367 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
8990368 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

8990372 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8990373 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8990374 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8990375 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8990376 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8990377 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8990378 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8990379 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8990380 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8990381 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
8990382 heel wat deelnemers zeiden dat ze aanvankelijk voor de doodstraf waren omwille van de informatie die ze te horen kregen via de media
8990383 veel opstelschrijvers waren ervan overtuigd dat de doodstraf een afschrikkend effect heeft
8990384 ze hielden er echter geen rekening mee dat misdaden soms worden begaan door mensen die ervan overtuigd zijn dat ze het gerecht kunnen ontlopen en ze hadden er ook niet aan gedacht dat goede straatverlichting en een effici nte politie voor een groter gevoel van veiligheid kunnen zorgen dan de doodstraf
8990385 de overheid schuift de afschaffing van de doodstraf bewust op de lange baan
8990386 ons land is op een cruciaal punt in zijn geschiedenis aanbeland we moeten de goede keuze maken en de mensenrechten respecteren
8990387 we mogen ons niet laten leiden door emoties maar we moeten we onszelf het recht voorbehouden om deze ultieme straf toe te passen

8990396 concerned and very disturbed by the media statements and articulations
8990397 the deputy president continues without mandate to attack the anc youth league leadership in the media despite our commitment that we will constantly engage with him and the anc on the resolutions and positions of the youth league
8990398 if there are problems the youth league has every right to do so but we are not going to engage in this in the media
8990399 prepared to die for zuma we are prepared to take up arms and kill for zuma
8990400 went in public to defy the decision of the anc national executive committee on his deployment to cabinet
8990401 a political case in our understanding can only require a political solution and not some highly questionable criminal justice system which has persecuted our president for more than seven years
8990402 so going around affirming the independence of the criminal justice system on the case of the anc president is worrisome
8990403 she heard two shots going off and found the two bodies at the back and informed the police
8990404 we actually disregarded any idea of it as a xenophobic attack there is not indication of that

8990420 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8990421 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8990422 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8990423 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that

8990459 in hindsight it actually sped things up the liberalisation process has been substantially sped up with todays ruling
8990460 were not necessarily going to build a national network but at least the process is now clear and transparent
8990461 there is only a handful of players that would have the financial wherewithal to build a national network altech would be one of those
8990462 i think icasa and the doc will now be more reluctant to oppose attempts to open up the market
8990463 it started to come together for us towards the end of last season and we have been able to push on because of it at the start of this season everybody knows how the next player plays now and also we have a togetherness in the dressing room
8990464 we have a good group of players we all want to be successful and thats why we are confident that we can have a good season we have scored in every game so far so we are confident that we have players who will score
8990465 i dont really care where the goals come from as long as we score but i think alves and tuncay will both score a lot this season they showed last season that they are both goalscorers we have created a lot of chances so far this season and as long as we continue to do that then the strikers will score goals
8990466 mido has been scoring and i am pleased for him he is trying to get fully fit if the manager wants to play him then that is great
8990467 hot on the heels of its denials that anything is wrong with the g92 and g94s comes another pcn product change notification that shows the g92s and g92b are being changed for no reason yup the problems that are plaguing g84 and g86 are the same that affect seemingly all 65nm and now 55nm nvidia parts it is hard to overstate how bad this is basically every 65nm and 55nm nvidia part appears to be defective we are hearing of early failure rates in the teens percent for 8800gts and far higher for 9600gts to make matters worse nvidia has a mound of unsold defective parts that they are going to bleed out into the channel along side of the hopefully fixed parts as a buyer you have no way of knowing which one you are getting until nvidia comes fully clean on this fiasco lists all the defective parts and orders boxes clearly marked you cant say anything other than just avoid them then again since doing the right thing would likely bankrupt them we wouldnt hold your breath for it to happen
8990468 georgia requires europes support in order to recover from the destruction of the war which in the short term means extensive humanitarian aid for relieving the problems of war refugees as well as those who have lost their homes
8990469 we cannot silently stand by as post cold war europes security architecture is attacked
8990470 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8990471 we will defend georgia to the end to the fall
8990472 using intels spec which is 10 years for a cpu to fail actual warranty is covered for 3 years only when oc a processor to about 12 of its nominal frequency it will not effect the cpu lifespan at all because you didnt raise any voltage voltage being the most important thing that will degrade the a electrical component heat is the next thing thats why cooling needs to be efficient
8990473 i havent heard of anyones cpu died in x years because he she oced it so i and anyone out there cant really tell you how long it will last as most people who oc will change to a new system cpu before it die anyway when i said 2 3years but maybe it can actually run for 8 years in oc form

8990482 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
8990483 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

8990487 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
8990488 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
8990489 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
8990490 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
8990491 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

8990495 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni

8990505 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

8990566 our own investigations agree with the atsbs preliminary conclusions dixon said

8990568 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political of outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
8990569 it is not true that mdc delegation has arrived in south africa for the talks
8990570 our negotiators are in south africa for the talks the talks are resuming this weekend
8990571 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humamanitarian crisis
8990572 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground
8990573 right now nearly 4 000 centrifuges are operating at natanz
8990574 this would be a pretty shrewd pick but one not without risk
8990575 how will she perform in the debate with sen biden on foreign policy he has a command of foreign policy details that few people in washington have she will have to cram like its her college finals
8990576 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics gov palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
8990577 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
8990578 shes an nra national rifle association lifetime member shes a right to life feminist she has every credential as a conservative she is young she exciting shes a mom with five kids
8990579 the huge gamble is that john mccain is 72 hes had a couple of bouts with cancer
8990580 it is likely he has already left perhaps for england or for another french port or perhaps he has headed to belgium or the netherlands
8990581 she is in shock she is suffering but she is also very courageous
8990582 priests and nuns are hiding out in the jungles because theyve no protection from police
8990583 as a mark of solidarity with our suffering brothers and sisters all catholic educational institutions in the region are closed
8990584 the rioters destroyed my house all of our family fled trying to save our lives ive got a 13 year old son and a husband who arent here in the camp and im worried about their fates
8990585 my house was burnt ive lost everything i was lucky to escape unhurt
8990586 ill dispose of the serious fraud office in exactly the time it takes them to understand the information
8990587 winston peters has been found guilty by a large number of journalists and a large number of politicians when in fact he is completely innocent in respect of these allegations
8990588 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8990589 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men 15 other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8990590 the afghan people and the afghan government have lost their patience
8990591 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
8990592 the prospect of codifying the ad hoc rules under which u s forces have operated in afghanistan since late 2001 sends shudders through the bush administration
8990593 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side
8990594 to us and the u s and afghan troops we were covering it appeared as though they were victorious
8990595 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8990596 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8990597 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8990598 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8990599 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8990600 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8990601 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8990602 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8990603 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8990604 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8990605 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8990606 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8990607 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8990608 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8990609 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8990610 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8990611 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8990612 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8990613 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8990614 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8990615 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8990616 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8990617 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8990618 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8990619 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8990620 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8990621 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8990622 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8990623 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8990624 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8990625 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8990626 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8990627 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8990628 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8990629 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8990630 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8990631 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8990632 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8990633 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8990634 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8990635 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8990636 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8990637 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8990638 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8990639 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8990640 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8990641 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8990642 no one works for someone we all just work together
8990643 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8990644 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8990645 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8990646 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8990647 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8990648 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

8990654 forensic specialists will begin the lengthy painstaking process of sifting and examining all of the contents
8990655 he liked to live life big with holidays and cars
8990656 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers she is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well

8990666 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8990667 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8990668 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8990669 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8990670 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8990671 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8990672 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8990673 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8990674 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8990675 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8990676 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8990677 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8990678 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8990679 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8990680 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8990681 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8990682 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8990683 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8990684 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8990685 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8990686 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8990687 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8990688 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8990689 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8990690 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8990691 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8990692 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8990693 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8990694 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8990695 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8990696 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8990697 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8990698 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8990699 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8990700 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8990701 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8990702 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8990703 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8990704 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8990705 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8990706 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8990707 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8990708 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8990709 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8990710 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8990711 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8990712 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8990713 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8990714 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8990715 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8990716 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8990717 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8990718 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8990719 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8990720 yes i think its great that it could put a woman that close to the white house
8990721 so what policies do they have that you agree with
8990722 are you going to make over 125 000 this year
8990723 mccain palin the choice for women who like speaking only when spoken to

8990726 i am pleased to have been able to play a small role in the development of singapores economy
8990727 over the years mr tatas business acumen has helped singapore tap into higher value added growth sectors
8990728 he is not in the intensive care unit he is in a reserved room
8990729 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8990730 they know what theyre doing i think we can let them take these babies home and love them now
8990731 strong indicator of good work occurring across new zealands universities in both teaching and research
8990732 the government is committed to ensuring that new zealand has a university sector that is internationally recognised and that supports the countrys economic transformation and social and cultural development
8990733 the long term worry is whether its sustainable with staff being paid more overseas and more heading offshore its not a good thing
8990734 the whole whanau needs to be brought into the picture as often bad habits start in childhood kids often go from house to house to house and the whanau as a whole needs to be aware and take some responsibility for healthy eating habits
8990735 unfortunately in many places fizzy drink is cheaper than milk but milk is still the better choice and water is free im horrified to see cases of type ii diabetes in teenagers today
8990736 under the pressure of other costs such as fuel and housing people are being forced to make a choice whether healthy food is worth it
8990737 obviously in the franks ben and owen case it is brother against brother but really if you focus on individuals and you focus on those sorts of contests you can be distracted
8990738 the jersey of the opposition is irrelevant really its much more important that we focus on our performance
8990739 im coaching canterbury and im just worrying about what this team does
8990740 no matter who the opposition is if our performances are up to scratch thats all i can ever ask for
8990741 assistant coach john haggart and i are really emphasising the need to do what we do and perform at the best of our ability and if its not good enough on the day so be it but lets not die wondering
8990742 weve got a lot of young people in this group and were exploring every avenue we can to increase their confidence and assuredness and decision making
8990743 this is the second time hes been with us and hes spent two days each time and done one on one with the boys hes done work with hags and i and hes doing one group session each time hes here
8990744 its very much a when the pupil is ready the teacher appears philosophy
8990745 adult millionaire daughter would be upset if she did not receive an expensive gift and party for her birthday
8990746 is emotionally upset by the abandonment of her father and deserves to have some kind of recognition for a young life well lived
8990747 we are particularly concerned at the secondary scamming that seems to be going on vultures in the shape of lawyers and consultants circling and picking the investors bones clean
8990748 if youre coming out publicly with a white knight image you really must be clear about where youre coming from what you charge chances of success and the timeframe involved
8990749 here they are with their recovery roadshow tearing up and down the country asking people to cough up 120 and then telling people their own hardship stories thats not helping thats helping themselves
8990750 time is a luxury for many of these people this kind of interference is compounding their problems its all about revenge and reparation eufa is trying to become the gatekeeper when it clearly has no right
8990751 regrettably its when people are at their most vulnerable that they believe anything
8990752 if anyone wants to suggest that im somehow making a nest egg out of this then theyre welcome to and i hope they get their jollies out of it
8990753 the message has to be understood when times are tough you need lawyers to solve the problem im not sure eufa understand this protesting isnt going to get you anywhere the only way to get any comfort is through issuing proceedings
8990754 weve recovered some money sued lawyers were suing developers weve got injunctions and weve stopped mortgage payments that comes through use of the legal process
8990755 legal proceedings are very expensive being part of a group makes it affordable for people who have seemingly lost everything
8990756 isnt it better having one firm one group of barristers acting rather than 10 different barristers with 10 different ideas a nuclear attack instead of a shotgun approach
8990757 there was no one else out there lobbying on behalf of investors no one challenging a lack of progress lack of action for that matter by statutory organisations
8990758 not so long ago the securities commission came out and said dont worry we will monitor the likes of bridgecorp if the laws worked properly or these authorities had done their job better maybe some of this wouldnt have happened
8990759 we believe land should be owned by new zealand citizens and residents only and our laws should be changed to say that we welcome ex pats coming home and people coming to this country to live but why should we allow singaporean australian or american speculators to buy investment properties in our country shutting first time home buyers from the market
8990760 i dont think there are hundreds of people just buying up new zealand we do sell houses to overseas buyers but it isnt a big deal the percentage is very minimal the people ive been dealing with recently tend to be first home buyers and people moving to hamilton from other parts of the country
8990761 the report makes it sound like new zealand is for sale but it isnt undoubtedly there is a number of overseas buyers looking after all its the only way they can look at a property looking at real estate is escapist thats why we have so much traffic people go online just to look sometimes its not like a bank website where you have to use it
8990762 on an average month our site gets around 270 000 unique visitors for the waikato in an average month around 370 000 pages are viewed about 12 000 pages viewed per day the waikato is the region of the country that has the lowest ratio of international visitors just 17 per cent the top region for international traffic is nelson bays with 39 per cent of all visitors from outside new zealand
8990763 i asked her if she was telling me it was terminal
8990764 she said yes so i asked how long i had the answer was six to 12 months
8990765 i have to prepare myself for the worst and as long as i can do that its fine to hope for the best
8990766 i also figure i can hope for spontaneous regression but this is so rare and unlikely that i havent even discussed it with my oncologist
8990767 a mate sent me a message that said as random and nonsensical as these situations are surely the same must apply to their departure i like that why couldnt that be me
8990768 i just thought i was in an unusual position to let people get an insight into the mind of someone in a situation thats so i dont know so nasty and so far removed from what any other 28 year old in a western country is going through
8990769 and to get a few things straight in my head i wrote for a month before i shared the link with anyone
8990770 sometimes i feel like a failure it shouldnt be that hard to live for 60 80 years loads of people do it all the time without even trying keith richards has done it despite actively trying to kill himself for 40 years
8990771 theyve got another 50 or 60 years ahead of them people will ask if theyve got brothers or sisters how will they respond do they say theyve got one sister or do they say theyve got a sister and a brother i dont know
8990772 in a weird way thinking about the funeral cheers me up itll be huge theyll be scalping tickets im hoping
8990773 no one can tell you what thats going to be like its a very very private lonely journey and i can only pray and hope that its pain free and not too uncomfortable
8990774 melanoma and cancer are very real they dont always affect the very old or the very young and theyre not always self inflicted toomey was never a sun seeker and when they get away from you they can be very very nasty
8990775 but for all that they can still be treatable if theyre caught early so for gods sake if you notice something get it looked at
8990776 i think the human mind is pretty good at adjusting its priorities to its circumstances
8990777 people often ask me how ive been able to stay so collected and together but i honestly think that most people would find themselves in the same mindset once theyd gotten over the initial shock
8990778 i cried myself to sleep for probably a week but at some point after that i just decided that i had to start thinking more constructively about my situation
8990779 was katie holmes offered the chance to reprise her role as rachel dawes in the dark knight
8990780 yes she turned it down because she already was committed to

8990806 the rockers have historically been the most courageous and honest musicians in cuba standing up to the castro regime and gorki aguila is the latest in that proud line
8990807 make no mistake about it the bands lyrics harshly criticize the castro dictatorship and that is the real reason aguila is being detained
8990808 aguilas arrest is a blatant case of musical censorship on the part of the regime and shows that nothing has really changed in cuba under raul castro since fidel disappeared from the public eye two years ago
8990809 we need to stand together and honor these men with the guts to do what the vast majority of musicians in my impoverished country havent done

8990921 its very unique to have that inherent loyalty hes always looking out for me and keeping me up to date on what i need to know
8990922 he can tell me the stuff that might be the most difficult stuff for someone else to tell me

8990947 the drought in the sahel in the 1970s created a shortage of watering holes
8990948 sometimes the elephants even break into our reserves and chase people to get the fruits because they dont have enough water
8990949 the problem we have is the lack of water we have excellent pasture but there is often not enough water for elephants and humans to share
8990950 the best water sources are hidden in the forest and the elephants open it up by trampling down the bush and exposing the grass to light they break off small branches which goats cannot reach often youll see a herder with his goats following the elephants through the forest
8990951 many herders and farmers take the arrival of the elephants as the start of the rainy season they wont plant until they see them because the elephants wont move until theyre sure they can find water

8990963 no interest in listening to that indictment not only because im expecting a new one to be filed but also because i have not yet put together my team of associates and helpers
8990964 can you explain to me what the difficulty is that youre having in dealing with the issues in such a prominent case in which the indictment was first filed over eight years ago
8990965 simply address any glaring or obvious issue related to the indictment
8990966 far more prudent particularly at this time the early stage of the proceedings to undertake the most comprehensive possible review to avert the need for any further issues later down the road
8990967 i find it surprising that bearing in mind the period since the original indictment the aim that everyone was aware of of concluding the business of this tribunal fairly expeditiously and the significance in the life and to the life of this tribunal of this particular case that you tell me now that its only once the accused is in custody that this exercise is being undertaken

8990971 i said already and im repeating it now absolutely it wasnt about reverse ethnic cleansing here in front of this honourable court i dismiss any possibility of characterising help for those people in that way
8990972 this area which the hvo defended was where the most people were saved and where the most humanitarian aid in bosnia was delivered
8990973 was a small number considering the million people already displaced around the world
8990974 i can only say that was to do with the war in mostar where both sides were involved bosnian army and hvo and where both nations got hurt

8991174 costello has that credibility and hes got a lot to contribute

8991179 it is requested that members do not partake of any refreshment until after the iftar refreshments are served
8991180 at no stage have we imposed ramadan arrangements on all staff and to say we have stopped staff having tea and biscuits is wrong
8991181 a memo was sent and we acknowledge it may have been worded slightly better
8991182 whatever is normally provided during meetings before ramadan will still be there during it
8991183 it seems that the council are backpedalling they should be a bit more careful about what they say
8991184 i am more than happy for the requirements to be put in place for muslim staff observing ramadan but i was unhappy about these provisions being extended to all staff
8991185 i took the memo to mean that no food or water could be consumed during daylight hours while at the council
8991186 there is absolutely no suggestion that during ramadan non muslim councillors have been asked to refrain from eating or drinking when muslims are observing the fast
8991187 as normal water will be provided at council meetings taking place during ramadan
8991188 tea coffee iftar packs and non iftar snacks will be available in a separate room
8991189 all thats being asked for is courtesy to be shown to the sensitivities around some councillors eating during the council meetings while others in the room are fasting
8991190 non muslim councillors have simply been asked to ensure that there is iftar food available for muslim councillors because in previous years muslim councillors wanting to break their fast following prayers had found that iftar packs had been eaten

8991211 siempre que viene un t cnico nuevo existe cierta incertidumbre hasta que no sabes realmente lo que quiere de ti pep me lo dijo justo antes de las vacaciones y me quede tranquilo
8991212 una de las t cticas que maneja el entrenador es salir siempre con la pelota jugada desde atr s y afortunadamente eso a m se me da bien
8991213 es cierto que se ha ido ronnie pero ha llegado daniel alves y xavi hern ndez tambi n est ah guardiola no ha establecido ning n tipo de jerarqu a en este aspecto as que lanzar el que sea vea con m s confianza en cada momento

8991296 es una oportunidad que tiene el productor de fruta tradicional
8991297 las perspectivas para colocar manzanas bicolor en estados unidos son muy buenas es un mercado enorme y con gran h bito de consumo
8991298 las variedades bicolor son muy nuevas y a n est n lejos de poder cubrir la demanda
8991299 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8991300 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8991301 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8991302 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity and some assumed we would continue with both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8991303 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to facts their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8991304 we plan to take them with us we do not know what we will expect at sea we have had indications that israel might stop us but we know full well that the palestinians that are coming with us have the right papers have the right visas and they should be allowed to travel there is no reason why israel is holding them hostage holding them prisoners in gaza and denying them medical attention denying them education denying them family reunification
8991305 the suspicion would arise that someone in the us created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates they needed a small victorious war
8991306 we are in the process of re evaluating our relationship with russia and we are doing that in concert with our international partners such as france but also many others including germany and all of the nato countries its premature to say i dont know what ultimately will result from the process that people are going to discuss what the consequences may be
8991307 this government will not be bidding for the 2018 commonwealth games
8991308 there is a lot better ways to spend 2 billion than on a bunch of sporting stadiums that will offer us a b grade sporting event for 10 days when australia can beat itself in the swimming pool
8991309 i am not going to see this state with the 2 billion of expenditure on sporting stadiums when the most pressing need for our state is economic infrastructure social infrastructure to underpin a significant economic boom in this state which will put enormous pressure on housing education hospitals road and rail infrastructure
8991310 this government will not be bidding for the 2018 commonwealth games

8991322 a clear and simple message that the united states has a deep and abiding interest in the well being and security of this part of the world
8991323 this came along and theres just no appetite for it now
8991324 at the moment people are worried that the current crisis in georgia will make it harder to insulate the nonproliferation cooperation from the wider difficulties in the relationship
8991325 without taking these actions the administrations tough talk should be viewed as white noise
8991326 my fellow americans it is an honor to address the democratic national convention at this defining moment in history we stand at a crossroads at a pivot point near a fork in the road on the edge of a precipice in the midst of the most consequential election since last years american idol one path before us leads to the past and the extinction of the human race the other path leads to the future when we will all be dead we must choose wisely

8991429 todos ellos se han mantenido completos de forma constante durante toda la muestra
8991430 les planteamos si les parec a conveniente postergar una hora el cierre de los pabellones y les pareci una medida muy positiva no hubo oposici n aunque algunos no podr n llevarlo a cabo porque tienen compromisos econ micos t cnicos y contractuales
8991431 esto permitir un mayor aprovechamiento de los pases de noche y que la gente pueda disfrutar m s de los pocos d as que quedan
8991432 as se descongestionar un poco la saturaci n moviendo m s a la gente sobre todo por la noche
8991433 pondremos espect culos infantiles deportivos y m s proyectos que estamos estudiando esa zona se puede aprovechar mejor y as se repartir de manera m s ptima a los turistas en ranillas
8991434 la marat n est organizada por la expo y por el corte ingl s y se destinar el 12 de los ingresos de las inscripciones a la construcci n de un pozo que abastezca de agua a la poblaci n de cinkass togo
8991435 durante el recorrido de la marat n habr puestos de avituallamiento cada cinco kil metros donde los atletas se encontrar n con voluntarios que les proporcionen l quidos pl tanos esponjas
8991436 adem s ofrecer n ayuda complementaria en los puestos m dicos y animar n a los atletas durante todo el recorrido
8991437 el desnivel favorece a las marcas que pueden alcanzar los atletas que se sentir n m s animados al saber que el inicio est situado en un punto m s alto que el final
8991438 la primera parte del recorrido es igual que la del a o pasado est centrada en el casco de la ciudad en la segunda pasamos al recinto urbano de la expo donde se podr observar el cambio que ha experimentado nuestra ciudad
8991439 no se queda s lo dentro de los l mites del aula queremos que tenga una implicaci n directa y unos flujos de comunicaci n y de conocimiento entre los barrios y los propios centros
8991440 necesidad de intensificar la sensibilizaci n hacia el mantenimiento de las zonas verdes
8991441 me gustar a que si el voluntariado sigue como tal se incorporase como una parte importante para entre todos encontrar f rmulas de colaboraci n y de implicaci n de la ciudadan a con los 50 o 60 kil metros de nuevos parques
8991442 la apuesta por las energ as renovables es un hecho
8991443 en el t rmino municipal de zaragoza tendremos el a o que viene tendremos ya un indicador sobre las instalaciones fotovoltaicas
8991444 espero que luego podamos visitar el pabell n porque llevamos una hora y media esperando
8991445 we all have made some serious investments in the mmorpg genre those investments are not simply monetary many mmo players have devoted their lives or at least their valuable free time to these games
8991446 that kind of reward system is very easily turned into a pavlovian or skinnerian scheme its considered best practice schedule rewards for your player so that they dont get bored and give up on your game thats actually exploitation players will naturally avoid boring tasks but developers override that by plugging into their pleasure centers and giving them scheduled rewards we convince them to pay us money and waste their lives in front of our game in this exploitative fashion
8991447 there will also be a list of things that players will never have considered doing more of a to do list like you log in to the game and go i dont know what i want to do today im going to pick a random achievement and go get it we dont have hidden achievements with the exception of very rare achievements called feats of strength that are worth no points
8991448 we have nothing new to offer you for now but in the meantime here is a reward system for doing all the stuff that you have likely already done and for some other things you never even considered doing
8991449 mantuvo una posici n muy firme respecto a tener en cuenta todos los estatutos y tener en cuenta la solidaridad interterritorial
8991450 un punto de partida desde donde se abordar n los aspectos m s concretos del modelo de financiaci n cumple con la constituci n recoge las previsiones de los nuevos estatutos de autonom a y se ajusta a los calendarios previstos
8991451 el nuevo modelo va a mejorar la financiaci n y ayudar a que los ciudadanos reciban mejores servicios
8991452 las comunidades aut nomas deben asumir su responsabilidad y no limitarse a pedir m s recursos al estado
8991453 los gastos en educaci n sanidad y servicios sociales han crecido en los ltimos a os de aplicaci n del sistema en el mismo porcentaje que el resto de gastos por lo que no se puede afirmar con car cter general que los problemas de financiaci n de algunas comunidades se deban s lo al crecimiento de los gastos en servicios p blicos fundamentales
8991454 es un ejercicio de transparencia y b squeda del necesario consenso
8991455 garant a de la financiaci n de los servicios p blicos fundamentales

8991458 la opini n de nogar que cuenta con gran experiencia en la ense anza del aragon s
8991459 el 99 de los escolares de la comunidad no conocen la existencia del aragon s
8991460 un problema porque la forma de reactivar el idioma es a trav s de la escuela y de los medios de comunicaci n
8991461 es m s grave que en las escuelas no se imparta el aragon s a que los ni os dejen de estudiar alem n o portugu s
8991462 los derechos que recogen leyes internacionales como la carta europea de las lenguas minoritarias y que reconocen que en arag n coexisten tres lenguas distintas no se est n cumpliendo
8991463 tenemos la sensaci n de que se nos han re do en la cara
8991464 muchas horas y muchos d as para obtener muy poca recaudaci n
8991465 ha sido un verano muy largo muy costoso y con muy pocos resultados
8991466 la declaraci n de guerra no es por haber incumplido los pactos de graco
8991467 sino porque se est convirtiendo en una ciudad poderosa y eso es lo que roma no pod a aguantar
8991468 desplazar la elecci n de los c nsules de los idus de marzo a las calendas de enero
8991469 el calendario actual surge con esta declaraci n de guerra
8991470 se ganaba tiempo para llegar a segeda a inicios de verano y no en oto o
8991471 para las personas m s profanas en el mundo de la arqueolog a
8991472 la teja la introduce en el mundo romano y tampoco en todas las viviendas sino en las m s nobles
8991473 las realizaban con madera de la zona que luego tapaban con una capa de tierra y encima de sta una capa de humus que era el terreno vegetal con semillas para que creciese y se impermeabilizase
8991474 no era necesario realizar chimeneas ya que si creabas dobles ventanas a una cierta altura sal a el humo por all y la vida era posible ya que la hac an en cuclillas
8991475 para acercar la cultura celt bero romana a los chicos de la zona
8991476 les hemos ense ado los productos que exist an en poca celt bero romana y cu les no
8991477 incluso hemos reproducido morteros romanos para que ellos hicieran su propia comida
8991478 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8991479 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8991480 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8991481 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8991482 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8991483 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8991484 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8991485 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8991486 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us
8991487 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
8991488 one second of him falling asleep and we will suffer for the rest of our lives
8991489 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
8991490 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
8991491 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
8991492 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
8991493 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
8991494 outro dia recebi uma liga ao da telefonica segundo a atendente o meu speedy estaria sendo descontinuado e haveria uma mudan a autom tica para um novo plano que inclui um computador gr tis questionando a atendente mais a fundo por uns bons 10 minutos descobri que a tal mudan a era uma mentira na verdade ela estava me empurrando um novo plano com um novo valor mensal obviamente mais alto e que entre outras coisas iniciaria um novo plano de fidelidade com respectiva multa em caso de cancelamento confrontada com o fato que que havia mentido a resposta que ouvi foi mas por que o senhor se preocupa com a nova fidelidade o senhor s cancelar o speedy se a empresa falir inacredit vel
8991495 this town must be special for him to put his sculpture here
8991496 developers are not to be questioned anyone who thinks otherwise should shut up were doing this live
8991497 this is going to be hilarious its almost as if mccain needed an escape plan and figured palin was the best choice to make that happen let the amusement begin as we watch mccain fumble even greater into absurdity
8991498 do you want this woman to be responsible for responding to the likes of vladamir putin
8991499 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8991500 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8991501 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8991502 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8991503 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8991504 he was trying to establish his role against a public perception that mccain might be stronger in a crisis situation
8991505 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8991506 he would be the right future president as long as he does what he promises
8991507 i like his idea to relieve the middle class by reducing taxes
8991508 and a retreat in iraq will be necessary because it is not good for a country to spent too much money on war
8991509 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8991510 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8991511 is a visionary and would certainly be a sort of fresh breeze on capitol hill
8991512 i think german people would vote in favour of him and hopefully america will do so
8991513 since hillary rodham clinton announced her support he has a true chance of winning the election
8991514 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8991515 soon after launch an update will be provided that supports download of paid content and more features such as versioning multiple device profile support analytics etc
8991516 the s c o states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetia issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8991517 even if it is eager to support russia in its conflict with the west and this is not clear china is not eager to somehow put at risk its own problems with succession and regions
8991518 chinas reaction to this dispute has been very muted because were also very aware of the secessionism in xinjiang tibet and the central asian countries also have the same worries
8991519 either had to just walk past or stop the bloodshed of that long suffering people
8991520 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8991521 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8991522 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8991523 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8991524 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8991525 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8991526 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8991527 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8991528 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8991529 he was trying to establish his role against a public perception that mccain might be stronger in a crisis situation
8991530 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8991531 he would be the right future president as long as he does what he promises
8991532 i like his idea to relieve the middle class by reducing taxes
8991533 and a retreat in iraq will be necessary because it is not good for a country to spent too much money on war
8991534 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8991535 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8991536 is a visionary and would certainly be a sort of fresh breeze on capitol hill
8991537 i think german people would vote in favour of him and hopefully america will do so
8991538 since hillary rodham clinton announced her support he has a true chance of winning the election
8991539 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8991540 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8991541 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8991542 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8991543 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8991544 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8991545 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8991546 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8991547 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8991548 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8991549 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8991550 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8991551 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8991552 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8991553 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8991554 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8991555 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8991556 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8991557 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8991558 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8991559 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8991560 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8991561 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8991562 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8991563 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8991564 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8991565 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8991566 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8991567 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8991568 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8991569 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8991570 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8991571 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8991572 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8991573 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8991574 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8991575 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8991576 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8991577 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8991578 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8991579 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8991580 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8991581 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8991582 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8991583 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8991584 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8991585 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8991586 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8991587 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8991588 coincide con un repunte de la moral de los hogares y con el aumento en la venta de viviendas
8991589 se debe especialmente al impacto de la devoluci n de impuestos aprobado por la administraci n bush como est mulo a la econom a
8991590 im very happy here im a young player and just like last year i hope to continue gaining the confidence of the coach to be in the first team at 18 is a privilege and im looking forward to taking advantage of every minute i get on the field last season was a very good one for me but thats already in the past everything is new now and were starting from scratch
8991591 with the tax refund effect on spending now more or less over we think the worst is yet to come for consumers
8991592 continued conservatism in it spending in the u s which has extended into western europe and several countries in asia
8991593 the thing that is concerning and the thing that is making the stock go down is theyre starting to talk about demand destruction in western europe and in asia
8991594 up until this point the large tech companies like the ibms of the world have done pretty well in holding up their earnings because theyve had strong and consistent international demand
8991595 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8991596 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

8991601 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8991602 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8991603 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8991604 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8991605 the running mate who can best help me shake up washington

8991615 were going through a great time of growth as more and more businesses learn about the benefits of having an online database support their business
8991616 once business people see how much more they can do with trackvia than say a traditional spreadsheet program like excel they immediately sign up

8991624 a malaysian is a person who holds malaysian citizenship passport and identity card thats it
8991625 living in a city that comes alive at night where 24 hour restaurants and mamaks are in abundance
8991626 i only began to feel a surge of genuine pride to be malaysian after march 8
8991627 is to be constantly tempted to leave to be constantly pushed to grasp at smaller and smaller straws to stay
8991628 empower national unity and integration through a malaysian way amongst its diversified races amidst rapid development of the country
8991629 to be young and to be indifferent can no longer be synonymous

8991636 i told congress thanks but no thanks to that bridge to nowhere
8991637 if our state wanted that bridge wed build it ourselves
8991638 the people of america expect us to seek public office and serve for the right reasons
8991639 and the right reason is to challenge the status quo and serve the common good
8991640 this is a moment where principle and independence matter beyond party lines
8991641 this is a moment that requires resolve toughness and strength of heart in the american president
8991642 in the darkest of places in the service of his country im going to make sure no one forgets that during this campaign there is only one man who has fought for this during this campaign and its john mccain
8991643 as the mother of one of those troops and as commander of the alaska national guard thats the kind of man i want commanding our troops
8991644 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8991645 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8991646 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8991647 the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy sen
8991648 were a better country than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment hes worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to china and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news
8991649 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8991650 now i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped my life and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8991651 and it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8991652 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8991653 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8991654 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8991655 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east we will do this
8991656 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccains been there for 26 of them and in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil that we had on the day that sen mccain took office
8991657 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies retool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant be outsourced
8991658 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
8991659 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland
8991660 but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination you know passions may fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8991661 we recognize this for what is was a well delivered speech on an historic occasion but barack obama didnt win my vote tonight and based on the content of his speech i think its unlikely he won the hearts of many hoosiers however for future generations it is important to recognize that tonight was an important milestone in our nations history

8991666 we started with master slave replication on mysql for a very simple reason we know it well and we know that while mysql replication has many wonderful features like simple set up it also has many deficiencies that have persisted for a long time

8991673 our government has a zero tolerance policy for drugs in our institutions illicit drugs in federal prisons compromise the safety and security of correctional staff as well as our communities
8991674 drugs undermine the success of our rehabilitation programs and increase offender recidivism rates the policy announced today will help better detect and eliminate drugs in federal prisons
8991675 the presence of drugs in correctional institutions interferes directly with our efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate inmates back into the community as well as contributing to violence and intimidation inside and outside of our institutions
8991676 i am pleased that the government is acting to improve the safety of our correctional institutions and the staff who work in them

8991767 nothing speaks louder than aunt kizzyz boyz music in our eight years of existence rbc has never signed a group based on one listen until we heard akb and it only took two songs we are not alone in our opinion as everyone who hears the group falls in love immediately above and beyond their musical talents the guys are incredibly hard working and gig over 200 nights per year although blues is not the most commercially viable genre we believe that with the right talent and music we can traverse this stereotype and we know we have this
8991768 its important to take your songs and play them for kids around the neighborhood and at school where people dont know youre connected to the music and watch their reaction
8991769 if you know a dj in a club take it to him let him play it watch people on dance floor and see how it moves them see what they have to say

8991776 as of the last 48 hours distribution has become less of an issue
8991777 we are thrilled that is now behind us and we can solely focus on putting a great product on the air
8991778 we were at 17 million homes august 30th and then were in 30 million after our first 30 days
8991779 we added comcast on august 15 and most recently time warner charter and mediacom we were hopeful that at this first anniversary we would have achieved all of our distribution goals and i think there is no other way to describe where we are at now than as a complete success
8991780 all the words i have heard from fox is that they are proud of the network
8991781 its a joint venture that is fully branded and fox understands we are branding the conference on the air but using their innovative technology and high quality production in doing so fox has also been able to learn from things we are doing so they can utilize on their other networks
8991782 the nfl is having a tough time doing it by themselves right now and i know we couldnt have done this by ourselves
8991783 you need the ability to be steady in choppy waters in my view this is not doable without a great strategic partner and that how i would describe fox
8991784 the btn gives us an opportunity to present our teams coaches and student athletes in a unique way but it gives us another opportunity to explore our universities through non athletic programming
8991785 our on campus studios allow these institutions in real time to bring stories and student athletes to our fan base our studio shows allow for an exclusive focus on highlights of big ten action and archived materials all of these elements will become even more powerful and help reinforce and actualize the branding rationale that was so important to our thought process to move in this direction
8991786 we did a lot of investing in dollars to bring quality people behind the cameras to represent the conference well
8991787 each school had an average of 80 contests this past year and over 90 percent of what we aired was in hd every school presented us with campus programming and we were thrilled to broadcast the events that had never before been on air
8991788 i thought the efforts to capture the campus activities through friday night tailgate was done well and
8991789 i love going back in time and watching some of those games because it brings you back in time to what your life was like and what you were doing and who you watched it with
8991790 you get transformed back to these moments and i think that programming has brought a lot of similes to peoples faces it is an element that has succeeded more than we ever would have thought
8991791 if you played in this conference you understand what this network is all about if you played here you can report it more intelligently its more than just a game here its a way of life
8991792 many of our former players and coaches are working in the media and we should be able to pull quality people from that pool
8991793 we have also hired some talent who have established themselves this past year and i think thats been remarkable
8991794 the michigan game was one of the biggest upsets in college football history
8991795 we reported it we had it on our air these are big events and you have to be credible to cover these events
8991796 i think the network accurately reported the sampson story but it did not make it a game story
8991797 you have to recognize the responsibility you have to report the news to the fans but the game is a game and you dont want to turn that into 60 minutes they hit a good balance between journalism and letting the game be the game in their coverage of that story
8991798 the network treated michigan football and indiana basketball with the appropriate amount of coverage and discipline i think other networks went completely overboard on the basketball situation we covered what it was were going to report what is happening but in no way are we going to sensationalize it either
8991799 by having a brand a name people know what they are going to find here
8991800 other networks will do a mac game then an sec game and then an acc game but thats exposure its not a brand here you always know its going to be about these 11 schools i dont think its a close comparison to what other conferences have
8991801 these sponsors are realizing they have a unique opportunity to attach their product to one of the premier brands in all of sports
8991802 people were lined up around the streets in baltimore in 1997 when we opened our first espn zone
8991803 they were able to experience that brand in a new setting and that is what we are doing here we are taking the big ten brand and strengthening it in a new 24 7 365 television network setting
8991804 this has been far and away the most challenging rewarding and fulfilling role that i have had
8991805 the challenges are significant but the rewards are off the charts
8991806 apart from exports everything including investment consumption employment and the current account balance is showing a trend similar to that of 1997
8991807 heres a little secret ladies men never really ask for anything they command and believe me what you wont do ten broads around the corner will

8991809 when you go to the grocery store to shop do you pick out the nastiest looking most rotten smelliest fruit or meat you can find
8991810 oh you dont why not its the same with men when they see baby elephant sized out of shape women
8991811 i didnt have much choice thankfully ive never tired of it
8991812 its the best upper body workout you could ever have
8991813 my family and i eat a healthy diet heavy in wild alaskan seafood moose caribou and fresh fruit
8991814 i guess my biggest pitfall is breakfast i know its the most important meal of the day but i still havent bought into it i hate to admit it but a skinny white chocolate mocha is my staple in the morning
8991815 my ideal fantasy is to be running on a hot dusty road just wearing running shorts and some kind of top that wicks away sweat but in reality im running in 20 below temperatures so i wear layers of fleece and always a good outdoor waterproof trail shoe right now ive been running in nike air structure triax and i always wear sunglasses my kids tell me to put them on so i dont freak people out when they see me with a goofy hairdo and no makeup
8991816 we were less interested in the stories of the superstar dominican players that weve all heard of
8991817 we wanted to know the stories of the guys that youve never heard of and you never will hear of
8991818 its not a typical story about someone trying to make good and lead the team to the championship
8991819 its about this particular person trying to adjust to a totally new world its a new take on the immigrant experience with the hero ending up in a small town in iowa instead of moving to a big city with a large immigrant community
8991820 i think this is going to open a lot of peoples eyes to an aspect of the game theyre not familiar with
8991821 at the same time its also a coming of age story and a self discovery story and i think many people will be able to relate to that experience
8991822 in that time we have to decide if we like the kid and want to sign him or not
8991823 there are independent private facilities that work with young players from an early age
8991824 some coaches start training kids from little league age many kids go to school and then train in the afternoon but others drop out of school at 12 or 13 to train full time in hopes of achieving this nearly impossible dream and if they dont make it they dont have any sort of education to fall back on
8991825 although its ultimately a pretty personal story about a very specific person and his journey it came about through this accumulation of details of a common experience
8991826 its not the story of a poor boy that comes out of the ghetto and makes it to the major leagues
8991827 its a different viewpoint on a story of immigration and its also a story about understanding who you are as a person
8991828 miguels whole life is baseball but he suddenly realizes that this thing that hes really good at hes not exceptional at once thats stripped away what do you do
8991829 i thought it was really important for us to represent sugars world as authentically as possible
8991830 and everybody along the way has really wanted to help facilitate us in that
8991831 if we found someone interesting wed bring him in for a callback to read from the script
8991832 a lot of them had no idea what they were doing but their coach or manager had told them to come some of them thought they were going to be on pbs we got really lucky and we found some amazing young people who were just so natural and fun to work with
8991833 i played baseball until i was 20 everyone wants to play baseball every father wants his children to have a chance to be the next sammy sosa or pedro martinez its a sport that can change your life in one day
8991834 because i never signed it feels like a godsend i was never in an academy when i was a baseball player being in the movie i met a lot of important people like jos rijo and jos cano that didnt happen when i was a baseball player but its happening now
8991835 algenis got the role not because he was a good pitcher but because he is a good actor
8991836 but hes also a good athlete which made it easy for me in the film he looks like a professional pitcher to have two months to do this role and to be this ready for it he has to be a gifted player
8991837 he was so charismatic and charming we had to put him in the movie
8991838 he had tons of great stories about when he played baseball and he used to play for the as my favorite team
8991839 the main reason we play is that we are poor
8991840 we are desperate to leave the country and find a way to help our families i was throwing a ball and i was throwing it well because that was the only way i could help my family
8991841 when i first signed there was nothing even close to this we would just sign and go to the united states and start playing right away
8991842 i thought the script for sugar was awesome when i first read it
8991843 its about my life and to be able to do something so different to be acting and consulting for a movie it was just an outstanding opportunity
8991844 i know what these kids are going through i came back to the dominican to try and keep playing but that didnt work out
8991845 for most of them the number one problem is language specifically ordering food and finding food they usually eat at someplace like mcdonalds where there are pictures
8991846 starting salaries in the minor leagues average around 1 000 per month
8991847 american players can get a significant signing bonus to offset a few years of low pay but dominican players are often paid far less than american kids getting signed out of high school or college
8991848 so that miguel in the film would be able to experience the community in a much more intimate way
8991849 theyre baseball fans who have been doing this for years
8991850 they have extra room in their house and they like to take care of the players but their number one priority is seeing the team win
8991851 even though this isnt really a baseball film baseball is one of the underlying themes so every part of the baseball has to be accurate
8991852 in the dominican republic we could shoot at a real academy the players on our team are all players formerly signed to the academies the coaches are real coaches we hired a baseball consultant who could watch every play to make sure that we were never cheating
8991853 things are a little bit more fluid in the dominican in terms of schedules
8991854 but i think its kind of good for everyone to slow down a little bit sometimes when everything runs like a machine you dont have the opportunity to discover things
8991855 any time you mount a production in another country there are always logistical hurdles to get through
8991856 and the scope of this film is large with a lot of moving parts we were dealing with baseball opposing teams lots of extras lots of props but we had a really good team and a lot of them spoke spanish so the language barrier wasnt too difficult
8991857 there are things here you couldnt shoot anywhere else and it was really important to capture those specific elements and locations
8991858 on the other hand working with the sun in the dominican republic was a huge challenge between 11 00 a m and 3 00 p m the light is incredibly strong and almost bleaches everything out we were shooting mostly on baseball fields so i couldnt really cover the set with anything to block the sun i prayed for clouds every morning its really beautiful in the morning and really beautiful in the evening but you cant shoot the whole movie in the morning or the evening
8991859 we were initially introduced to the town because there is a ball field on the outskirts where a lot of the kids come and play
8991860 we noticed a lot of similarities between the story of miguel and those of the kids who converge on the local field to play softball and hardball then we started exploring the side streets of the town and found this beautiful street that became miguels street
8991861 at first there was an incredible amount of curiosity and then an incredible amount of excitement the community was very supportive of us and a lot of them actually appear as extras in the movie because the day before miguel leaves for the united states theres a big party and the whole town comes out to celebrate
8991862 we used the uniforms and the stadium of the real team
8991863 miguel leaves a place of comfort for somewhere that is really strange and awkward for him we wanted the dominican republic to feel really natural sort of pastoral arizona and iowa are more garish with more neon and artificial lights so i tried to give the dominican republic a softer palette and arizona and iowa have a stronger brighter punchier palette when he gets to new york which has a sizable dominican population i returned to that more comforting palette we used when he was at home
8991864 its an amateur league that has a ton of former professional players we were shocked that there was this huge community of latino players who were living in the bronx and playing in this league some are in their 20s some in their 40s and they are still super competitive but they have a great time
8991865 im sure when americans go see a game and see sammy sosa they think that dominicans are great baseball players who make a lot of money in the big leagues
8991866 what theyll see here is the players who are up and coming who are working really hard to become something

8991906 data and security oriented roles were the hottest roles in our study based on a combination of high risk and impact of the roles coupled with scarcity of supply
8991907 the growth in types and volume of information has been driving roles associated with data or information management
8991908 while a 500 person it shop may need hundreds of software developers for example theyll require no more than half a dozen enterprise architects information security experts or storage directors
8991909 cios need to identify their primary skill gaps determine which roles they should hire cultivate or rent identify where they can compromise and develop retention and development strategies for those roles
8991910 many of the hot roles demand breadth influence without formal power and knowledge of company culture rather than hiring these from outside source roles from within

8991931 after i got that behind me i felt comfortable throwing the ball
8991932 its really good to have kole out there making a lot of plays
8991933 they were also doing some things that gave us some problems with the running game
8991934 i think it was a good game for the defensive line and for the defense in general
8991935 where is computing being done right next to you or far away
8991936 now we are in a world where you can get the best of both worlds when you call a subroutine that subroutine can exist on another computer across the internet and they think they are calling a local subroutine
8991937 people get confused there is storage in the cloud which is clear that your file should be up there and geo distributed and backed up and there is computation in the cloud those are both great appropriate things
8991938 the one that is without any tradeoff is to have the logical storage master up in the cloud
8991939 the most important thing is the creation of the software industry and the importance of having this platform that anybody can write to there was no software industry before the pc came along
8991940 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
8991941 shes got the grit integrity good sense and devotion to the common good and thats exactly what we need in washington today
8991942 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8991943 governor palin has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8991944 governor palin has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8991945 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
8991946 we dont want people to focus on the exact track this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and the entire florida peninsula is going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
8991947 we want every every floridian and guest to be a survivor
8991948 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
8991949 just wanted to sent a quick note to say how great everything went on our move from hampstead to salem nh i cannot emphasize enough how professional courteous and conscientious the guys were i just wanted to thank you and your team for a job well done
8991950 just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
8991951 ladies and gentlmen in my estimation i think were ready for this threat
8991952 i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so
8991953 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level
8991954 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing

8991957 the market is conjuring up images of a replay of three years ago when katrina wreaked havoc on the refinery system in the gulf so were seeing a little spike from that
8991958 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8991959 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
8991960 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8991961 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8991962 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
8991963 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
8991964 they havent given me any guarantee that this will not happen again
8991965 theres a whole series of our vehicles full seized trucks and some cross overs that have a heated windshield washer system
8991966 the circuit board apparently can short and normally what happens is theres smoke and the system doesnt work but in rare cases there could be a fire
8991967 in rare instances a fire can occur so we want to make sure that our customers are safe
8991968 its a very simple and fast fix and it really isnt all that inconvenient to them especially this time of year
8991969 in spite of the rapid dispersal of the economic stimulus payments in the april to july period consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth
8991970 with the tax refund effect on spending now more or less over we think the worst is yet to come for consumers and we expect an outright decline in real q3 third quarter consumption
8991971 the broad outline is roughly the same the details fill themselves in as you go
8991972 i knew what would happen at the end of 21 from the get go for instance but i had no idea what would happen aboard the aircraft
8991973 hughies probably more interested in the boys than the supes right now the legend obviously left him hanging regarding their history and their ongoing mission
8991974 youll see him doing a little sniffing around in the coming months when he can because hes going to be very busy he probably feels no different about supes than he did before his relationship with member of the seven annie is another matter entirely of course given that right now neither knows who the other really is
8991975 i have always tried to make the conversation stuff as dynamic and interesting as possible in some way i like moving my mental camera around a stationary scene than traveling through a changing one the people on the plane and arranging those sequences were far more challenging
8991976 to have garth tell it there are still surprises he has for himself along the way
8991977 yes we have the arc planned out and ive brought some things to the party but really its his epic and i am doing my best to bring it to the page as close to the mark as hed like
8991978 i knew what we had with the boys before it was even printed i was a big fan of enniss preacher series and im taking a lot of direction in the pages because i believe the heart of the success of this project is that garth has a great sense of humor and a clear idea of what he wants the series to be and i can help him achieve that and walk both lines i love drawing these characters that weve created
8991979 the next arc is we gotta go now running from 23 29 with an epilogue in 30 the books halfway point so its obviously a biggie
8991980 well see the boys taking a look at the g men earths most profitable superheroes
8991981 frenchie and the female get a chance to work their own particular brand of magic too butcher meanwhile comes at things from another angle and makes a discovery that pisses him off enormously which means someones going to get taken off at the neck
8991982 by the end of this storyline things will have gotten fairly intense the big secret is not pleasant issue 29 closes with what i can only describe as an inferno
8991983 he has sledgehammers for hands they were all a lot of fun to design designing these guys is the best part of the job
8991984 i was protective of the cover art for the first two years but when i recall how fun it was to see my colleagues and heroes draw spider jerusalem on the transmetropolitan covers i couldnt say no
8991985 cassadays cover is very cool once you see your own characters depicted through another artists eyes you see them differently yourself
8991986 we tend to just say to the artists here you go any character you like any scene you like go for it
8991987 i tend to find that gets better results from cover artists than heavy handed direction at least when it comes to one offs so far ive only seen john cassadays and howard chaykins covers both of which are top notch
8991988 voglio far capire alle persone che non sono sole so come ci si sente completamente da soli e senza nessun aiuto lultima cosa che vuoi sentirti dire in quei momenti vedrai che tutto andr bene lunica cosa che pu davvero aiutarti che qualcun altro che si sentito cos ti parli della sua situazione

8992048 the concept behind kind of blue grew out of the way the two miles and evans played together
8992049 evans and davis were certainly on the same wavelength and the pianist certainly contributes more than a sidemans share of kind of blues air of pensive melancholy in addition to which his eloquent liner notes titled improvisation in jazz cued listeners to hear the album as the very essence of jazz an unmediated exercise in spontaneity
8992050 took place in the nick of time its impossible to imagine davis evans coltrane and adderley coming together so harmoniously a year or two later by which point each had become not just leader of his band but practically founder of his own school
8992051 the last king of america how miles davis invented modernity
8992052 kind of blue would not have been possible if the lp did not exist
8992053 it was jazz conceived for the record album not only because of the playing times of the tunes but also because of how the album creates an overall mood kind of blue is not simply a series of tracks as the standard small group jazz album of the day was kind of blue was one of the few jazz records of its time that had a sense of narrative a cohesive inter relation between the tunes it was a work not a bunch of disparate tunes used to pace a small group jazz album one fast tempo piece one ballad one blues one or two standards a bop oriented original the sense of the album as an organic whole added to its appeal
8992054 improvising on the sparest and starkest of scales as an alternative to bebops dense thickets of chord changes
8992055 sprang verbatim from evans introduction to alone together on an earlier recording of that standard by chet baker
8992056 along with dave brubecks time out another columbia jazz record released in 1959 that made jazz a middlebrow music a respectable music for middle class educated people who felt they had refined taste this was enormously important for davis both commercially and artistically for the rest of his career as jazz ceased to be dance music it needed middlebrow status in order to survive as art music davis was essential in making this transformation possible

8992086 channels in bacteria perform absolutely key roles in cell survival we have been able to show how this channel opens and closes understanding how they work will play a major role in inhibiting the survival of bacteria and could have applications as basic as cleansing hospital equipment and wards or helping to make food safer these channels are found in mrsa and c difficile and this knowledge has not yet been exploited the future path is to find new chemicals and processes that exploit the importance of the channels to these bacteria
8992087 the system is mechanical the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8992088 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8992089 new chemicals designed to force channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader

8992118 i swear to you on my love for slipknot this is not a joke its the 100 truth
8992119 they shouldt change they should make another iowa im sure the next album will sound like the old ones
8992120 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
8992121 when we were starting out we had all these strikes against us
8992122 we were from iowa there were nine of us we wore masks we wore coveralls we played metal hard metal
8992123 it was tough getting people to come out to des moines
8992124 i dont know why its a pretty cool place but a amp r dudes jaded folks from los angeles or new york its hard to get them to come to iowa
8992125 we also took a lot of shit from other bands
8992126 when we hit the road with ozzfest in 1999 i heard a lot of condescending remarks from other musicians they were saying
8992127 our music stood up were much more popular now and it wasnt because of our image it was the music
8992128 its our fourth album and we wanted to do something different
8992129 you cant put out the same record over and over again at the same time you can definitely still tell that this is slipknot
8992130 im looking forward to the expressions on peoples faces when they hear the new record
8992131 theres very very heavy stuff on this album and its gonna blow peoples minds but im also excited for them to see the stuff thats different on this album the more experimental music no ones going to expect it
8992132 i think everyone just went in with an open mind we would always listen to everyones ideas and if they worked they worked if they didnt they didnt
8992133 this time we really tried to build off the ideas really tried to work on them i think it helped that so many of us were able to spend time doing our own thing too just writing with different people really makes a difference in how you think about music when we finally came together we were able to bring that to the mix
8992134 it gave us more time and energy to experiment in the studio i was able to come up with more guitar sounds than ever
8992135 our shows were like sporting events wed put everything into them and then afterwards wed be fucking exhausted we werent going to pile into a van all nine of us and then drive all night to the next show wed have fallen asleep at the wheel and died
8992136 those early shows were rough but i loved the small stage
8992137 there was something intimate about it it was like an old school punk show which is what i grew up with
8992138 it was 8 000 degrees youre bumping into people youre tripping over equipment those small stages have low ceilings so the heats trapped real low right at your head those shows are about survival not about playing
8992139 shawn used to bring chop saws on stage to grind pipes for sparks
8992140 once a chunk broke off and sent a kid to the hospital but people who got hurt at our shows were cool about it wed follow them to the hospital and sign some shirts and shit it was like you know no harm no foul
8992141 wed be on tour and fire marshals would show up with camcorders and accuse us of all kinds of crazy bullshit theyd say we heard you set yourselves on fire
8992142 sid and clown would spray each other with lighter fluid and then theyd pull out lighters that got us in trouble one promoter would call the next theyd warn each other and theyd hit us with do not lists we were castrated
8992143 sometimes we hate each other sometimes we hate the world sometimes we just hate our own lives but when we get together something monstrous happens and we pull this amazing sound out of all that energy
8992144 we believe in world domination and this is the band thats gonna get us there
8992145 you know we went from being some local band in a basement to selling millions of records
8992146 its going to be a decade since the first album came out im so happy and amazed and proud and thankful for where this band has gone ive gotten to see the world and i get paid for it id have done it for free
8992147 i think the best part about being in this band has been getting exposure to the rest of the world you realize that everything in the world is the same people feel the same they have the same desires hopes fears being worldly is a gift that i dont ever want to give back it changes your life especially when youre from a small town in iowa
8992148 i always knew wed go far i just knew it
8992149 there was no way this band was going to fail but i never knew wed reach the heights weve come to weve traveled the world so many times all the different countries are like our second homes to this day it still blows me away that we took this crazy idea and made it a global sensation
8992150 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
8992151 ok golf could be fun but do i have to walk

8992155 we started with master slave replication on mysql for a very simple reason we know it well and we know that while mysql replication has many wonderful features like simple set up it also has many deficiencies that have persisted for a long time
8992156 the code is in the early stages but will mature very rapidly
8992157 we are looking forward to creating something that brings powerful replication within the reach of every database user
8992158 a potential incremental scale out offering for customers using low end databases and hardware that either cant afford or dont want to buy into the whole oracle rac architecture
8992159 this is an interesting long term opportunity but in the near term the most significant opportunities for tungsten probably lie in improving the replication and high availability features for mysql

8992234 entrepreneurialism is fundamental to capitalist development economic growth and renewal however some innovations created by entrepreneurial activity can have destructive consequences as the financial engineering that contributed to the global credit crunch demonstrated

8992257 it is perhaps this history which informs the reaction in european countries to muslim immigration however there are very real differences between european and muslim culture in terms of history in europe religion has traditionally been used to oppress in muslim countries it has historically been the state which has been at war with a much weaker religious authority in the case of islam there is no clergy and it has operated on the fringes of power somewhat reminiscent of pre roman christianity
8992258 this partly explains the differences in threat perception between europeans against catholicism versus muslims against islam
8992259 it is for perhaps this reason that some of the more insightful western analysts may privately insist on supporting religious groups at least it was the rage pre 911 when these groups were considered a bulwark against communism not just to use as a pressure group within the country but also to perhaps create a muslim clergy which would first gain dominance and then wind up disgusting the people this is a very long shot and would take years but more likely will create more suffering and wind up failing nonetheless
8992260 i hope this gives you a perspective on a wider time and space scale
8992261 because in the islamic sensibility if an islamic state does not have jurisdiction over europe or another country it will not ask people to incite trouble there
8992262 if you live there then live in peace and if you cannot then you should not live there
8992263 however as i said above that does not prevent a child of immigrants in europe to start acting european himself although to native europeans he may seem only half european and demanding the rights he is given by the local constitution which may seem like a contradiction to native europeans i
8992264 he is asking for his islamic rights as well as his european rights doesnt he know that is contradictory

8992340 we started with master slave replication on mysql for a very simple reason we know it well and we know that while mysql replication has many wonderful features like simple set up it also has many deficiencies that have persisted for a long time

8992351 our government has a zero tolerance policy for drugs in our institutions illicit drugs in federal prisons compromise the safety and security of correctional staff as well as our communities
8992352 drugs undermine the success of our rehabilitation programs and increase offender recidivism rates the policy announced today will help better detect and eliminate drugs in federal prisons
8992353 the presence of drugs in correctional institutions interferes directly with our efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate inmates back into the community as well as contributing to violence and intimidation inside and outside of our institutions
8992354 i am pleased that the government is acting to improve the safety of our correctional institutions and the staff who work in them

8992371 everybody has the potential for having a little bit of flexibility
8992372 its another way for me to express myself and show off my physique which i work on several hours every day
8992373 girls tell me gay sex is hot that was very shocking to me
8992374 most are curious or bi and the others just want the money the few honestly straight guys who just want the money are hard to work with mostly because they havent really come to terms with their sexuality what they need to realize is its ok to be who you are
8992375 if they tell me theyve never done it before thats all it takes to get me ready to go
8992376 to be honest ive yet to run into a gay for pay model
8992377 we do hear from a lot of young straight guys but theyre only interested in solo work if a straight guy posing naked and jacking off for the enjoyment of gay men is gay for pay then i guess i know a lot of them im familiar with the concept of g4p and im aware of some well known gay porn performers who are supposedly straight in my own experience though i havent met any
8992378 quite honestly we have always assumed that gay for pay is really just a marketing ploy to sell the straight fantasy to gullible consumers
8992379 the vast majority of the performers being billed as gay for pay are actually bisexual or gay
8992380 gay means happy happy content and accepting of your homosexuality
8992381 so while many of these gay for pay models are bisexual or homosexual they are not gay as they have not been able to be happy and accept their own sexuality they can rationalize their actions as long as they are being paid to do it
8992382 it also might be a way for some guys to come out im not gay im getting paid to do this what ive noticed over the years though is that most of them become more gay acting the longer they do gay porn
8992383 i was surprised to find so many straight men in gay porn
8992384 the ones who continue to identify as straight say they dont enjoy the work theyre just in it for the money
8992385 our models and staff dont have gay on straight fantasies michael lucas forbids them
8992386 you seldom get good chemistry between gay or bi guys and gay for pay models in my best scenes the ones ive enjoyed the most and the ones that have been nominated for awards ive always worked with a gay scene partner
8992387 should use our good looking gay models we need to have more respect for our industry and ourselves
8992388 we have always felt it was somewhat degrading to our customers and ourselves to use gay for pay performers
8992389 there are many hot gay performers who actually enjoy what they are doing on film and thats what we want to portray in our films our core erotic premise is showing hot gay men having hot gay sex not straight performers being paid to do something they arent into
8992390 straight boys are easier to work with theres nowhere near as much drama
8992391 but i have had more than one tell me the more i deal with womens shit the more i realize i like men better they continue to like affection from women but they prefer to have sex with men because theres less drama
8992392 ive had sex with a lot of women and im as gay as they come
8992393 i myself am gay but 99 percent of the models i employ are gay for pay the gay for pay guys work really hard and they are always turned on and ready to go when the cameras start to roll i think this is because they are all secretly bi and its their chance to have sex with a guy regardless of whether its on camera or not when i was a performer i always requested to fuck or get fucked by the gay for pay guys then always hooked up with them off camera i probably shagged too many but i was gorgeous and in my prime
8992394 the gay for pay guys sometimes show up with their girlfriends who sit beside me by the monitor and watch their boyfriends fuck and get fucked
8992395 nine times out of ten these girls are gorgeous sometimes porn stars themselves and they definitely get turned on watching their lovers nosh down on some guys cock hbo made a documentary about gay for pay guys for which they shot me making a film called brute in it ben campezi fucked jason hawke in the wrestling ring bens then girlfriend sara diaz a penthouse pet watched and instructed him how to suck jasons cock it was quite extraordinary
8992396 we all like things that are unattainable seeing these boys cross the line is a huge turn on
8992397 there are so many people shooting gay porn now that you have to set yourself apart from the rest of the pool

8992424 there are the ones we know we lost then there are the ones we dont know we lost then are are the ones we know are not lost
8992425 is that many people want the government to have even more control over our lives mainly health care and retirement look this is the fbi if they cannot keep track of sensitive data how in hell can we trust another government organization to do better
8992426 accountability is the one thing the government has always lacked and the one thing they seem to want from everyone else you me and any other non government entity

8992428 people of the country have started taking interest in sports other than cricket and if it continues then we will certainly bag more medals in the next olympics to be held at london
8992429 quality infrastructure and latest equipment should be provided to sportspersons for this the government various sports bodies and indian olympic association will have to play a crucial role

8992435 e un impegno durissimo forse lunica squadra che avrei evitato volentieri avrei preferito di gran lunga la dinamo bucarest e una squadra di enorme valore tradizione ed formata da validissimi palleggiatori il pubblico poi abituato a certe sfide quindi non ritengo che soffriranno molto il fatto di giocare prima al san paolo dopo tante stagioni senza riscuotere successi cerca il riscatto e ci evidenziato dal fatto che in campagna acquisti hanno speso molto come ultimo rinforzo arrivato suazo si sono rinforzati tantissimo per passare il turno gli azzurri dovranno disputare due gare perfette
8992436 a parte la grande impresa contro la juventus nella coppa uefa del 1989 ricordo con piacere una strepitosa qualificazione centrata dal napoli di vinicio proprio in portogallo contro il porto landata a san paolo era terminata in parit 0 0 nella partita di ritorno il napoli con rete di clerici espugn il campo di oporto che vittoria straordinaria il napoli usci dal campo tra gli applausi del pubblico lusitano correva lanno 1975
8992437 forse manca ancora qualcosa sul piano qualitativo nutro qualche perplessit sul piano dellesperienza poich molti azzurri si affacciano per la prima volta sul palcoscenico europeo e poi non prenderei la questione europea di fondamentale importante il cammino in campo ha una rivelanza maggiore rispetto alle coppe sul piano tecnico vedo una difesa migliore soprattutto nei movimenti dei centrali santacroce fortissimo sempre puntuale e preciso nei suoi interventi personalmente non disdegno nemmeno rinaudo che a parte la doppietta col vllaznia gi ha alle gode di esperienza in europa avendo partecipato col palermo a qualche edizione della coppa uefa
8992438 credo si manterr sui livelli dello scorso anno lottando per una qualificazione in europa di certo ripetere grandi partite disputate nello scorso campionato praticamente unimpresa battere le grandi non sar facile a mio avviso non dobbiamo tanto fossilizzarci sui risultati ma dobbiamo valutare se vi sar una crescita collettiva della squadra ancora presto per ambire a grandi successi la strada quella giusta abbiamo i mezzi e i giocatori per toglierci parecchie soddisfazioni gargano se si disciplina tatticamente pu diventare un grande centrocampista potrebbe essere un grande trascinatore e poi sono curioso di vedere allopera in campionato denis potrebbe risultare come una piacevole sorpresa
8992439 al presidente si devono riconoscere tantissimi meriti quello pi significativo di avere portato la nostra squadra a livelli decorosi ha costruito una societ solida e si circondato di persone giuste scegliendo marino ha assicurato alla squadra una stabilit pluriennale il progetto serio e valido ma ci vorranno ancora parecchi anni per colmare il gap dalle grandi big del campionato e nonostante il bacino dutenza partenopeo non sia da meno rispetto ad altre piazze del massimo campionato impensabile di poterci allineare subito a squadre come inter e milan che alle spalle hanno colossi finanziari e possono elargire milioni di euro di stipendi
8992440 amauri poteva sul serio farci fare il salto di qualit garantendo alla squadra una ventina di gol sicuri fisicamente impressionante di testa fortissimo il suo cartellino poteva essere anche alla portata del napoli ma il problema restava lingaggio il suo ipotetico acquisto avrebbe creato malumori nello spogliatoio
8992441 a parte balotelli che reputo gi anziano per il modo in cui si approccia alle partite credo che sia lanno di giovinco e russotto se juve e napoli avranno il coraggio di lanciarli titolare credo che per mezzi tecnichi godano di tutti i presupposti per fare grandissime cose

8992459 when the vehicle did not stop after several signals the german forces opened fire at the car
8992460 when the forces later checked the vehicle they found two children and a woman dead and four other children wounded in the vehicle

8992498 hari inilah saya datang ke padepokan andika untuk membuktikan kabar tadi
8992499 bahwa saya telah mengajarkan dan menyebarluaskan ajaran sesat dan menyesatkan
8992500 jika andika menyebarkan kesesatan artinya telah keluar dari ajaran islam yang sesungguhnya
8992501 seandainya saya melakukan kesesatan dan menyebarluaskannya artinya saya telah murtad kafir mungkin juga musrik tetapi benarkah tuduhan itu bahwa saya telah sesat dan menyesatkan dengan ajaran yang saya sebarkan bukankah saya menyebarkan ajaran islam meskipun kita hanya memiliki satu ayat menurut kanjeng nabi maka sampaikanlah tidak bolehkah menyampaikan sesuatu tentang ajaran islam yang saya anggap benar dan harus disebarluaskan
8992502 memang itu tidak salah sudah seharusnya karena mengajarkan dan menyebarluaskan agama merupakan kewajiban kita sebagai umatnya
8992503 mengapa saya dianggap melenceng dan sesat karena saya bukan seorang wali seperti andika mungkinkah karena saya hanya seorang rakyat jelata
8992504 ya ajaran itulah yang mengkhawatirkan jika andika terus menyebarkan ajaran sesat saya khawatir rakyat yang menerimanya keluar dari esensi islam yang sesungguhnya

8992603 some of the things that we have identified as contributing to the number of uninsured in texas with regards to health insurance are the number of small businesses that are paying relatively low wage that we have in our state our number of people getting employer coverage is less than in other states theres an economic climate in texas that is very much free enterprise which affects that other factors are that health care costs more here also we have overall lower household wages
8992604 texas has had a number of initiatives started to address the problem of the uninsured theres a lot of activity a lot of legislative activity that is happening were finishing up two interim studies one of them is more affordable options for small businesses to offer health insurance ways to make it easier for them including premium subsidies help to cover the cost to the business were also looking at that for individuals other sources of funds that might be used to cover their health insurance premiums
8992605 but when you look at whats really going on the number of uninsured dropped by 1 3 million and the increase in coverage under medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip went up by 1 3 million

8992613 quiet humble confident just a sincere interest in doing whatever it took to get here once he set his mind on georgia he was coming to georgia that was it and whatever obstacles where in the way whatever you say i need to do i will do it and he did he did a great job and he never wavered
8992614 right this second hes not in the starting lineup no but we want him to play so hell play chris davis could easily play some guard and vance could play some tackle and were creating depth by moving guys around a little bit which we wish we didnt have to do but we have to this year ben jones will play well have a true freshman snapping the ball some time during the game and we hope to get justin anderson in the game and hes a redshirt freshman
8992615 once youve been through it lived through it for an entire season youve got a lot more confidence at least the types of things that are coming at you throughout the year and im sure he was able to reflect look at some of the things he didnt like didnt get right and try to get better this year he still knows hes got to learn what were capable of doing a lot of that is going to have to do with the capability of our offensive line a year ago i thought he and the offensive staff did a great job of not trying to go beyond the boundaries of what our offensive line could accomplish and i think theyre going to have to do it again unfortunately theres probably going to be some limitations of what you might do if you have a real veteran offensive line you can probably just dial a play but with this group well probably have to be a little bit careful in terms of what we can accomplish
8992616 you can prevent it if you decide not to block and tackle in practice but half of our injuries were pulled muscles when youre teaching guys to play the way the game should be played guys are going to get hurt
8992617 everybody has depth everybody has enough players but how many experienced players is kind of what were talking about when you look at our next three guys in line to play on offensive line its three freshmen two redshirt freshmen and a true freshman so thats not a lot of experienced depth its zero experienced depth and even some starters have no experience safety could become an issue in a hurry if we had something happen fullback got dangerously thin but at least we found out some things early enough to do something about it to provide some depth but theres no experience behind chapas right now
8992618 hes not out of the mix as a punt returner and he is still returning kicks im not sure if it will be him or ramarcus starting i dont know for sure if both of them will get it but those are the top two right now we dont think the other younger guys are quite ready for it yet i dont mind him doing both just so long as hes not doing every kickoff return and every punt return but if hes taking some punts and some kicks i dont think that would be so bad but to be the guy every single time and play the position hes got to play i think it would be too much
8992619 he learned what to do pretty quick hes a quick study i still dont know if he talks he hardly says a word he just works he works hard hes tough hes athletic and he learned what to do he got to the point where he was a pretty darn good football player and were really looking forward to getting him back
8992620 right side of the line right guard right tackle if he has to play left tackle hes got to play left tackle thats why im curious curious to see what happens with a lot of those guys
8992621 hes a smart player an athletic kid that can play all three positions which is a major advantage to us he kind of fell into the outside linebacker position he looked really good there too hed been inside at mike and will and we put him out there because of trying to get reps and a couple injuries and we really like him there he looks like a natural at all three of them which is an advantage for us
8992622 thats always going to be something coaches and players care about but youve got to win one before you can win two youve got to win two before you win three so we take it one game at a time but at the end of the day thats what were playing for were playing to go undefeated and win a national championship
8992623 i think that going into the season with the injury to quintin banks thats puts a little damper especially to our two deep safety system but i think that with john knox there hes going to provide depth at both safeties rambo hes been doing a good job obviously experience is something that he lacks but i feel like hes been doing good at practice
8992624 its big its a lot different than practice at practice youre going up against guys that you know when you go against them its kind of a competition and youve been going up against them all camp so you really know them but now youre going up against another group of receivers every single week but with every game you get more experience and grow as a player so hopefully for the younger people that will happen
8992625 athletically hes about as good as you can ask for hes unbelievably quick strong flexible he can bend hes everything you want youve just got to have experience but that will come and i think hes got the mentality to get it done
8992626 the thing people dont realize is we were never promised or guaranteed to be in that position we went to a great bowl game in the sugar bowl we had a great time down there and were fortunate to be in a good position this year
8992627 theyre a talented group theyre a smart group and theyre out there just playing their hearts out theyre going to make mistakes but at the same time theyre going to do a lot of good things and theyre just going to learn and get better as time goes on
8992628 once that first hit comes on you get a better feel for it and youre like alright cool and youre back to normal ive gotten a little contact so i dont think itll be a problem
8992629 we lost a good guy there but every year i dont think you have to replace a certain guy every year somebodys going to be different it wasnt always a guy like him back there you dont have to replace exactly what he left you have to leave your own thing maybe next year people will be saying you left this year you lead in different ways
8992630 the main thing is being able to communicate the spread they try to hit you fast most teams run the no huddle out of the spread offense so from a defensive standpoint youve just got to be able to run to the ball and hit that closed space and make open field tackles
8992631 thats basically how the whole defense wants to play if anything goes wrong we can always look at dannell he always has energy and everyone can feed off him hes out leader

8992637 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8992638 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear

8992928 if any person had told the parliament which met in perplexity and terror after the crash in 1720 that in 1830 the wealth of england would surpass all their wildest dreams that the annual revenue would equal the principal of that debt which they considered as an intolerable burden that for one man of ten thousand pounds then living there would be five men of fifty thousand pounds that london would be twice as large and twice as populous and that nevertheless the rate of mortality would have diminished to one half of what it then was that the post office would bring more into the exchequer than the excise and customs had brought in together under charles the second that stage coaches would run from london to york in twenty four hours that men would be in the habit of sailing without wind and would be beginning to ride without horses our ancestors would have given as much credit to the prediction as they gave to gullivers travels

8992973 our goal is to identify biomarkers that will help predict which patients will respond to therapy against insulin like growth factor several inhibitors of the igf pathway are in patient studies right now theres a large movement to understand which patients will respond to these drugs this is a step toward that goal
8992974 we have technology now to allow us to globally assess what igf is doing in breast cancer at the whole gene expression level
8992975 this is one of the first studies to do that we know that igf is bad in cancer but now we can globally understand it in a more comprehensive manner it could lead to finding biomarkers for patients response
8992976 we found that igf i is a major regulator of cell growth and cell survival
8992977 if you have something regulating dna repair you want that turned off
8992978 once patients are resistant to hormone treatment as with tamoxifen their treatment options are limited a treatment that inhibited receptors for igf might give them another option
8992979 growth begets further growth which is good news for both china and india but this column argues that it is easier to create or improve a market than to build state capacity which means that china with its lagging private sector is likely to fare better than india which has deteriorating institutions
8992980 interestingly the change in trade sectors accounts for almost all of growth in the advance it accounted for more than all gdp growth and while the proportions coming from export growth and import shrinkage are about the same here i think absolute percentage point contributions are important reductions in real imports now are calculated to contribute 1 45 percentage points as opposed to the earlier estimate of 1 26 percentage points of course some of this reduction is due to the weaker dollar as journalistic accounts have stressed but unlike exports imports are according to macroeconomic estimates highly insensitive with respect to exchange rates and much more elastic with respect to income so i suspect that real income is either actually stagnants or falling or perceived to fall in the near future
8992981 the set of possible policies is not that different from what it was in 1975 there must be a combination of increasing the supply of energy and reducing the demand for oil that can include more drilling and it can involve alternative energy sources one of the lessons that mr ford understood was that it also needed to involve high prices in recent decades there was far too little investment in energy either in the search for more oil or in alternative sources and too little effort devoted to conservation neither suppliers nor consumers acted as if they believed prices would stay high mr ford understood that weak economic times were hardly ideal for raising taxes and proposed offsetting the energy taxes with rebates and income tax cuts that would leave the money in the economy but still propel the needed conservation and investment his proposals were buried on capitol hill and in due course the lessons of that era were forgotten
8992982 a large number of interrelated steps are needed to reduce systemic risk that is the types of failures of institutions or procedures that might cause the entire system to crash such a calamity was narrowly avoided in march when the federal reserve took some extraordinary actions to prevent the abrupt failure of bear stearns cos in a nutshell those steps will involve limiting risks undertaken by financial institutions much of whats needed is likely to meet strong resistance because those limits might prevent a return to the high level of profitability that prevailed before so many people and institutions overreached and created the mess we are in today
8992983 the core inflation rate you see in the news the cpi less food and energy does do a fairly good job of representing the information the fed uses to forecast future inflation i e it is a measure of the trend rate of inflation but not the best one and it also does well at approximating the information the fed will use to set policy but the actual process it uses is more complicated than this and the fed employs measures that are specialized for the job at hand
8992984 despite the fact that one of the great social achievements of the last quarter century is the emergence of a black middle and professional class people of color are still over represented among the poor and working class the advantage of income based affirmative action is it would address many of the same issues as race based affirmative action but it would also address the needs of low income whites and income based affirmative action would not create tensions between lower income whites who dont benefit from race based affirmative action and blacks who do demagogues would have a harder time using race to stoke the fires of economic resentment finally income based affirmative action would lead to more economic diversity on our college campuses and more economic diversity is a key to reversing americas trend toward widening inequality
8992985 respect by the have nots for the property rights of the haves
8992986 continued stress in the housing market and concerns over liquidity and the need for more capital have kept the outlook for the financial sector and brokers in particular fairly negative

8992993 it is a pity that the french government rolls out the red carpet when the colombian politician ingrid betancourt comes to paris but forces the dalai lama to come in through the back door
8992994 only the french fear of losing business orders from china explains our cowardice
8992995 it is not by acting as a bedside carpet that we are going to gain respect from the chinese

8992998 guarantee the sane and stable development of french chinese relations
8992999 the new policies have led to rapid economic development chinas real per capita income has grown an average of 8 4 a year since 1995 climbing to 4 766 indias 5 average annual growth has raised per capita income to 2 534
8993000 about 45 of chinas workforce remains in the countryside 30 is in services and 25 in industry seventy percent of indias workers are still on the farm leaving services at 20 of the labor force and industry at 10
8993001 labor migrating from rural areas can usually go to work doing the rote tasks of factories so industry often takes the lead in economic development this may provide a growth spurt but research shows industry eventually bumps up against a ceiling at about 30 of the labor force and a per capita income of 20 000 beyond these levels further expansion of goods production doesnt raise income and economic progress comes from increasing services share of the economy
8993002 the comparison between china and india will make sense only when some day in the distant future the china has true democracy and freedom of speech
8993003 real time gdi has done a substantially better job recognizing the start of the last several recessions than has real time gdp
8993004 discussed how best to reconcile the slowdown in output growth over the past year with the relatively strong performance of the labor market
8993005 this apparent tension could partly reflect measurement issues in particular participants noted that the more rapid gains in estimates of gross domestic income over this period might better capture the pace of activity than the modest advances in measured gdp
8993006 gap between gdp deflator and cpi widest since 1980 for a graph

8993044 grade 10 on the internet since its much easier for most to understand i guess anyways the doors opened at 10 30 the new principal really did turn out to look and sound gay i thought everyone was exaggerating but it really wasnt an understatement and because of how
8993045 grade 9 school all the manuals were kept in class so we never had to carry any im going to have to get used to having sore arms for a while until i build
8993046 i am glad the nfl took a second good hard look at the case
8993047 it was agreed that we would begin the process of developing a comparative project involving between fifteen and twenty european countries to examine the interrelatedness of the mathematics related beliefs of teachers and students teacher practices and student cognition
8993048 to assume that the development of enthusiasm is sufficient to guarantee achievement would be na ve as there are countries in which students have little enthusiasm for mathematics but achieve relatively highly and of course vice versa
8993049 one of the problems of english education is that students experience a fragmented and procedural conception of mathematics due to underlying notions of vocationalism and so rarely come to see the subject as a coherent body of concepts and relationships which can be worth studying for the intrinsic satisfaction it can yield
8993050 the situation in countries like hungary is almost the complete opposite all students experience an integrated and intellectually worthwhile mathematics taught by teachers with little explicit interest in the applications of the subject but an enthusiasm for logical thinking and the problem solving opportunities that mathematics can provide
8993051 where teachers do not necessarily expect to teach students in ability groups but expect to work with the full ability range achievement is generally higher across the board
8993052 the most extreme case of overlooked diversity is the morphospecies apanteles leucostigmus
8993053 each attacking one or a very few closely related species of caterpillars
8993054 one of the messages of this paper is that you really need all of these different kinds of data in order to tell the species apart that just using the morphology alone or the genetic data or the ecological information alone isnt enough
8993055 however once the species are distinguished anyone can use the dna barcode to rapidly and accurately identify one of them
8993056 this represents microgastrine wasps reared from approximately 3 500 caterpillar species in acg
8993057 since there are an estimated 10 000 species of caterpillars there including many unsampled ones that mine inside leaves or live in fungi this is just the tip of the microgastrine iceberg
8993058 the family braconidae to which the microgastrines belong has about 15 000 described species in the world and its been estimated to have 50 to 60 000 species which is about the same as all vertebrates all fish birds mammals amphibians reptiles which is a lot
8993059 and what were saying is that if anything were underestimating how many more there are
8993060 this isnt just about cutting down on the number of squirrels killed on the roads we also know that when a natural habitat becomes fragmented such as by the introduction of unnatural barriers like roads there is a lesser chance of the species surviving in the long term because the opportunities for breeding are fewer the bridges hopefully encourage the squirrels to explore a wider area and therefore lessen the chance of inbreeding by finding out whether they actually use these bridges we can assess how useful it is to install them
8993061 an snh grant for rope bridges was successfully applied for by the local community of strachur and two have been erected across the main road there but we needed to find out how cost effective they were before spending any more money putting them up at other sites when we looked into it we were surprised to discover that no one has ever really tested the efficiency of these bridges the research that stephen from the university of leeds has now carried out should help us make our case when we apply for funding for future projects
8993062 in areas where there is a high population of squirrels then the new bridges we put up were being used within a couple of days not surprisingly we also found that baiting the bridges with food also encouraged the squirrels to use them this kind of information has never been collected before and it could now be used by other wildlife conservation groups or even by developers when considering plans for new road building projects that cut through squirrel habitat
8993063 our masters programme in biodiversity and conservation provides us with an opportunity to conduct the kind of research that could have a real impact on british wildlife this project is just one example
8993064 well be suprised in heaven at whos there and whos not
8993065 you white people think you can try and do anything shouldnt you hire someone to do that

8993067 we have found out that we are stronger than we ever thought we were
8993068 since the nineteen seventies vigorous technical debates have been in progress regarding the function of plasma which however have not led to any conclusive results in particular we do not fully understand the exact energy coupling mechanism
8993069 ever since plasma has been discovered and utilized significant differences have existed between theoretical predictions on the behavior of the plasma and actual measurements
8993070 electron resonance can even be controlled specifically to initiate the mechanism
8993071 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral
8993072 this will show dinas true colors thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8993073 nuestro taladro t rmico es como una sonda de fusi n

8993079 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8993080 youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8993081 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8993082 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8993083 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8993084 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8993085 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
8993086 we are planning for our convention to open on monday
8993087 like all americans we are monitoring the situation closely in the gulf
8993088 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
8993089 these storms have a tendency to change and so i dont have a scheduling update for you now
8993090 if its a major hurricane i think that they certainly need to show they learned lessons from three years ago both from a policy and perception standpoint
8993091 the republicans cant seem to catch a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8993092 public messaging and attention to the public affairs part of the response is going to get added attention
8993093 the american people want to know the people they elected are paying attention care about them and are making decisions they need to make
8993094 the smart thing is not to poke their chests out and say what a great job theyre doing or going to do but just to do what needs to be done
8993095 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8993096 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8993097 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8993098 obama took sky high expectations and brought them down to ground level with a tremendous political speech that tried to connect with the concerns of average american voters
8993099 he managed to mix boiler plate policy proposals with american stories and values into a road map for the fall campaign it will take a few days before we know whether voters think obama hit a home run here in denver tonight but by any measure it was a big success
8993100 he made the argument that he is qualified to be commander in chief which is one of the criticisms that has been made against him because of his judgment not his experience and again he questioned john mccains judgment but if this speech is successful for him it will be because he got through to people who are worried about their kids education who are worried about whether theyre going to have health care and he talked a lot about that
8993101 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8993102 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8993103 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8993104 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8993105 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8993106 this was democracy at its best it was open you look at everything the people the surroundings the colors the imagery it reminds you of athenian democracy
8993107 this is about that you know we use images of these columns from athens to tell us about our history of democracy about openness about the people and we have a great example of this where this has been opened up i think for the first time and may set a precedent for future conventions very powerful
8993108 theyre at the white house they are at the library of congress they are at the largest memorials and they draw us in and they remind us this is about democracy extremely powerful images
8993109 the white house and you see them walking off into it it showed that hey were normal just like you we are a family very very powerful images here we havent seen these by the way since the kennedys and when you see them walking away you see that they fit in theyre comfortable here were comfortable with them this is extremely powerful theyre going to be talking about this for a very long time very tough to top
8993110 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8993111 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed
8993112 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life
8993113 he could also have been killed by one of the spikes
8993114 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8993115 and i said to the church hey were gonna have to go rent a facility somewhere else unless god drops a couple million on us and i was joking i wasnt praying for it i wasnt asking for it i was just kind of being funny and four weeks later thats exactly what happened
8993116 it usually means something bad happened so i was expecting something horrible and obviously that wasnt the case
8993117 he sat me down and told me of his intentions and i could tell right away he was serious and his spouse was right there with it and it was wonderful
8993118 in year one were gonna give all of it away

8993141 this is the first human study to show that the fat in obese people is sick meaning that it does not function as it should
8993142 the bad health effects associated with obesity are probably not caused by the extra fat itself
8993143 they probably result from the constant overloading of the system with excess calories
8993144 people have all kinds of theories about why bariatric surgery works the way it does but the most simple and straightforward explanation is that the dramatic and immediate reduction in caloric intake is responsible for this improvement
8993145 we know it exists but we dont have a good molecular explanation for it studies like this one provide important clues

8993155 he is willing to take a risk and put it all up on the line i think the republican base will be pleased by this
8993156 this the most out of the box pick in a very long time
8993157 it says to me that the mccain camp believes the democratic convention was a success for the democrats they cannot afford to play it safe
8993158 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
8993159 there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
8993160 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
8993161 one that with the departure of hillary clinton from the race that this is an opportunity for mccain to make even more headway to a key voting block
8993162 second theyre aiming to reinforce message of reform palin is someone who has made a mark on both the state of alaska and nationally as someone who has taken on ethics reform boldly
8993163 the mccain campaign seems to believe those two qualities will more than make up for her lack of national exposure
8993164 if hes going to argue shes ready hes taken away the argument that barack obama isnt

8993171 the over prescription of antipsychotics is a serious breach of human rights these drugs should only be a last resort
8993172 the forthcoming national dementia strategy is a crucial opportunity to stop this dangerous over prescribing and we look forward to its launch in the autumn
8993173 this study should remind us all that antipsychotics are powerful drugs which can both be essential for some people while carrying other risks this is another warning that all antipsychotics should be prescribed with great thought and care and be subject to rigorous follow up

8993191 that was the last time ever i peeked on someone hiroshi
8993192 ohh i think im going to throw up oh how my head hurts
8993193 the very thought that that could be possible no its too terrible to even imagine
8993194 im reforming i swear no more peeking no more sneaking to look at the girls even its all over for me i swear that monstrous sight is indelibly printed on my soul
8993195 we hear the sound and creep in oh poor we a girl we think we innocent peeps we
8993196 the horror the sanity gnawing dark revelation of the evil mockery this frail existence of ours is
8993197 hiroshi calm down you sound like something out of h p lovecraft
8993198 an american writer he wrote about things just like this
8993199 and we see there is indeed someone there removing their clothing we creep closer silent and unseen we shiver with disgust as we quickly recognise the dark clad vile form we see
8993200 no we think that epitome and mockery of all such activities that are so dear to us and then then the garment drops and we behold the ultimate secret the supreme terror
8993201 frozen we are frozen and unable to move as the monstrous misshapen diminutive form waddles into the bath naked and terrible woe
8993202 finally we can move we move we run for our lives run like all the demons of the hell be pursuing us we try to overrun that terrible glimpse of unholy reality but it flutters after us a memory a memory a memory too terrible to be forgotten
8993203 no matter what we do we still see it so clear every unholy detail so well etched to the tender canvas of our gouged minds with a mighty cry we bang our heads against the implacable cement of the yard but in vain the image remains the terrible knowledge the knowledge of the dark attentions that could be visited upon us should the thing know we saw it
8993204 dark clad and unnameable it could creep to visit us in the dark of the night force us to act in perverse unwholesome ways to sate its devilish fantasies no i cannot sleep i cannot close my eyes for the fear of seeing that awful sight printed inside my fluttering eyelids
8993205 hiroshi my dear friend my fellow in the ultimate dark horror of revelation cry with me woe is us the terrible ruin we have by our own clueless curiosity brought upon us i dread the dark of night knowing the secret i cannot rest lest that thing creep up to me demanding unnatural attentions and gruesome acts hiroshi cry with me it tears my soul to know that happosai is a woman

8993225 gay activists and their allies have made no secret of their strategy to convince bible believing christians and jews that homosexual behavior is no longer sinful in gods eyes
8993226 this false doctrine is playing out in denomination after denomination with increasing discord
8993227 christians are not called to rewrite the bible in order to love our gay friends and neighbors true love does not sacrifice the truth
8993228 an unconditional welcome to people of all sexual orientations and gender identities

8993230 the more than 2 5 million individuals in the 3 100 congregations supported by the institute for welcoming resources and these partner organizations are some of our movements most valuable advocates in promoting understanding reclaiming what unfortunately has become a narrow view of moral values espoused by those who seek to divide and advancing lgbt equality
8993231 our biblically based opposition to the normalization of homosexuality and the affirmation of homosexual behavior should not hinder us from ministering to homosexuals and offering them the love and healing environment they need to leave this destructive and unbiblical lifestyle

8993238 in the near future we will not be looking back at the early church with envy because of the great exploits of those days but all will be saying that he certainly did save the best wine for last the most glorious times in all of history have not come upon us you who have dreamed of one day being able to talk with peter john and paul are going to be surprised to find that they have all been waiting to talk to you
8993239 and you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not and have found them liars
8993240 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into apostles of christ
8993241 rick joyner the harvest 128 129 so from what i can gather joyner says that they are going to reverse what the apostle paul did peter wagner has recently written a book called the new apostolic churches which explains the new apostolic spirit that is raising international leaders it is from these churches that the new christianity will go forth and be implemented throughout the world we are not talking about those who plant churches or are leaders of movements or denominations but those who claim spiritual authority just like the apostles by revelations and miracles this boasting before the facts is a constant theme throughout these mens writings i have more to boast of than any man ever had i am the only man that has ever been able to keep a church together since the days of adam neither paul john peter nor jesus ever did it i boast that no man ever did such a work as i
8993242 the result of that visitation is that the poor misguided flock is united and transformed into a majestic war horse a great vehicle of power and energy a fearsome awe inspiring effective tool of war
8993243 those in this army will have the kind of anointing his kind of power anyone who wants to harm them must die
8993244 i had a vision of you people coming from a circle of maybe a hundred miles and i saw people coming from every major city within that circumference and a great conclave was taking place and it was the training of joels army i believe that people are going to come together by the thousands and train for the army of the lord thats long overdue
8993245 i had a dream that became a recurring dream and it was about all the stadiums and weve told this hundreds and hundreds of time all across america all over the world in fact and i saw these stadiums and football fields soccer fields and sports arenas all of them filled with thousands of people sometimes over 100 000 in each place
8993246 promise keepers meeting april 29 1995 detroit silver dome the last time i read the scripture it was jesus who was the captain of the lords army and he was in charge then as he is now in the church who will be the leaders or leader of this church army we have no appointed generals except self appointed ones today god has made local churchs as part of the universal church each is autonomous none answer to a leadership that controls them all since they are to be called men in the pastorate listening to gods direction for their communities as well as in the world why wouldnt you want to be a part of what god wants to do with his hand picked leaders i think almighty god is going to rip open the hearts of our leaders i think hes going to tear them open and i think hes going to put them back together again as one one leadership w eve got to have one leadership one leadership only weve got to have everybody hitting on all cylinders theres only one race its the human race theres only one culture its christ before culture christ culture thats all that there is
8993247 in dreams and visions blue often represents heavenly mindedness the sky is blue and gray speaks of those who live by the power of their own minds the brain is often called gray matter this will be a conflict between those but who live mostly according to their natural minds and human wisdom and those who follow the holy spirit
8993248 i do not believe that this prophecy can now be stopped or that the lord wants it stopped

8993264 it would be quite dangerous for the bank of canada tostart fooling around with that interest rate cuts becauseinflation is still sticky
8993265 credit growth is still fairly hot here so i think thebank would be playing with fire by cutting rates at thisstage
8993266 over time it looks like growth is going to remain weak slack is going to build and the risk on inflation is tilting tothe downside but i think its premature for the central bankto signal the all clear

8993273 suspending uranium enrichment has no logic behind it and it is not acceptable and the continuation of negotiation will not be based on suspension

8993301 mr peters is an honourable member and i must accept his word unless i have evidence to the contrary
8993302 i have accepted mr peters word i have to say that i have had dealings with mr peters for a number of years and i consider that i have not ever been led astray by him
8993303 i think its essentially a political issue for the court of public opinion
8993304 i have accepted the honourable members word and will continue to do so unless something arises out of the privileges committee or some other appropriate authority which suggests i shouldnt do so
8993305 obviously with there only being four home test matches it was going to be a difficult ask for new zealand cricket to allocate two tests to the basin
8993306 in my mind we are a two test a summer venue so theres always a tinge of disappointment when weve only got the one but thats going to be a great fixture
8993307 the icing on the cake is the twenty20 we know how our city gets in behind the sevens so id like to think we can create the same sort of mood

8993319 with tasman not being there next year pretty much every week its important for us to win because its another opportunity to say stuff you guys you got rid of us
8993320 in three years weve gone from a team that didnt win any games to a team that can foot it with the big unions so every week is an opportunity for us to say that again

8993322 at this stage my contract with tasman is for next year as well and still has to be honoured as far as the monetary part is concerned but obviously ive got to look for a new union come next years npc

8993366 literally over the last few days geopolitical differences in the caucasus have led to military confrontation the events that followed have greatly exacerbated the international situation a direct consequence i believe will be a buildup of military political positions by the north atlantic bloc and all this will occur primarily near our states borders

8993379 august is going out with a bang for the energy markets as gustav rolls in and hanna and her sisters are following right behind
8993380 cyclone activity is really ramping up and all along the gulf coast the storm watch is in full gear
8993381 if gustav does damage to refining or drilling facilities then all bets are off as to how high gasoline and heating oil could go but the most incredible spike could be left for natural gas which is already at bargain basement levels

8993391 i think they were geared up to try and stop the triple option and we didnt run the triple option a lot they were definitely playing the run thats why they were vulnerable against the pass early on we threw the ball some early on
8993392 i was thankful for the opportunity to run it again
8993393 we showed our fans and the nation what this offense can do
8993394 we have a lot of talent here and we were very productive we have some things to clean up but we looked pretty good
8993395 he didnt play perfect but i thought he did some good things and made some plays hes like everybody else hes gonna get better the more he plays

8993744 after 30 plus years devoting myself to my art and craft i needed to make a musical statement that someday i could look back on and realize at that moment of time i did exactly what i wanted to do ive never written songs like this i was on this inspirational roll there was an urgency to it i realized that i had no more time in my life for rehearsals and i took that energy into the studio

8993907 i think teams who have deficit should be kicked out of europe
8993908 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly

8993916 when a clarification of this news report was sought from their lordships the bishops of jaffna and mannar the minister was reassured by the bishops that the communication was made without their sanction and appears to be the writers personal perspective
8993917 the two bishops have also acknowledged the excellent cooperation extended to them by the sri lankan security forces and in particular the security force commanders serving in the wanni who are in regular contact with them and have often facilitated delivery of humanitarian assistance when requested by the bishops
8993918 the purported communication to the un secretary general is sourced to one father james pathinathan who is said to be president of the peace and justice commission in the wanni

8993929 a dilutive capital capital raise is not in the plan and should not be necessary given what he knows now and added that he is even more confident about the levers available within the company
8993930 long term ambition for asset management which fitzsimmons said seems to indicate that the bank might keep its evergreen investments unit

8993938 a forthright strong and results oriented leader as governor sarah palin will bring exceptional energy and ideas to the position of vice president of the united states
8993939 its unfortunate that a celebration of the democratic partys presidential nominee was marked by this situation we take such threatening messages very seriously and im glad that a suspect has been arrested
8993940 bella arriverei ad odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male
8993941 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razzionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi stelle niente aveva pi senso
8993942 torner talmente presto che non avrai il tempo di sentire la mia mancanza prenditi cura del mio cuore te lho lasciato
8993943 una cosa mi era chiara e la sentivo in fondo allo stomaco al centro delle ossa dalla punta dei capelli alla pianta dei piedi e nel mio petto vuoto chi ama ha il potere di distruggere e io ero stata distrutta sbriciolata
8993944 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche quando il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scarti e bonacce prolungate ma passa persino per me
8993945 essere amati tanto profondamente ci protegge per sempre anche quando la persona che ci ha amato non c pi
8993946 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8993947 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare

8993962 after extensive deliberations i have decided that although we do not condone the actions antonio participated in for a time as a competitive athlete he is remorseful and is now in a position to speak out against the dangers and consequences of using illegal substances
8993963 the university of north carolina has one of the most if not the most stringent anti performance enhancing substance policies in all of amateur or professional sports
8993964 there is no excusing that i regret my actions and am embarrassed for what they have done to my family teammates country and the sport of track and field
8993965 i know i have an obligation and duty to speak out against the use of banned substances i want to play a role in teaching people especially young athletes to know that the negatives far far outweigh the benefits these substances may give you
8993966 has done an extraordinary job of teaching and coaching our young men and women for the past two years and would never encourage them to make a similar mistake
8993967 he has dedicated his coaching career to making a positive impact on track and field and to teaching people of all ages that it is better to compete with honor than to win at all costs
8993968 one of the things that we try to explain to our players is that every year youre going to be playing some non conference games and a lot of times they may not have name recognition
8993969 certainly everybody knows who notre dame is but theres to be some teams over the next ten years that may not have that name recognition so you have to rule out what you see on the helmet
8993970 the offense all really centers around what our offensive line can do and what our quarterback can run
8993971 we think that derrick fourroux has done a really good job of running our offense and getting the ball to where we need to get it in the past well see if thats going to happen that way this year
8993972 they are a very fast football team they are very similar to appalachian state from the standpoint that theyve got some talented fast kids
8993973 once you hit this tunnel and the smoke is going and you hear the fans going crazy and the band is playing and you see the recruits down there its just a feeling thats unmatched
8993974 its a blessing to have the opportunity to play like this there are a lot of schools that dont have stuff like this so i feel like were blessed every time we hit the field its going to be a tremendous opportunity for us this saturday

8993980 the room guard was over zealous he should not have done it she already passed security and his only duty was to guarantee the safety of the artwork in his room
8993981 it is not acceptable for people to completely cover themselves on the street it threatens public order and security plus it is a terrifying sight and only increases the cleft between natives and foreigners
8993982 a manual of islamic law certified by al azhar as a reliable guide to sunni orthodoxy says that

8993987 we seek to reduce the fear of islam and increase christians love for muslims
8993988 an irrational fear of islam or a lack of christian love for muslims
8993989 christianity is the best and maybe the only chance we have of defeating islam just earlier i said that our main problem was organizational christians have that solved and have many times exerted social and political pressure christians bring a certain mass to the solution just imagine what could happen if christian intelligence communications organizational skills morale and capital could be brought to bear christianity must realize that this is live or die as a civilization and there are only two choices war or annihilation see turkey egypt iraq and north africa for what an annihilated christianity looks like
8993990 most of all they need somebody to speak with imams must therefore be open to listen to homosexual muslims we recommend that everybody respect homosexuals and lesbians
8993991 it isnt possible to live homosexually and at the same time say that one practices islam these are two incompatible things
8993992 no homosexuality goes against what islam stands for and therefore it cant be combined
8993993 the imams should listen to homosexuals and to their concerns but naturally we will also inform them about islamic thought and how it relates to homosexuality
8993994 i dont want to speak of curing or that homosexuality is an illness as an imam i will note that every muslim should live in conformity to basic islamic principles
8993995 we stress that the islamic council of norway rejects the death sentence for homosexuals in norway but we dont want to go into legislation in other countries
8993996 as said the islamic council cant get involved in how other countries are run
8993997 he he no ive heard much about it and it was certainly not so clever of me

8994067 eviscerates the rights of voters who should be choosing their judges by election
8994068 it appears this could be a lay up for this court to enter an injunction pending review as if the talented justices on the panel knew what had to be done but could not bring themselves to do it
8994069 the governor pulled similar tactics to prevent the chief justice seat from going to election indeed a retiring supreme court justice bargained with the then governor if she agreed to retire early would he agree to let her pick her replacement that retired justice was quite public about her bargaining power see ex 8 to ex c but that little bargain intentionally disenfranchised minnesota voters

8994080 we continue to believe that the contagion effect of subprime and credit related issues within financials has largely been underestimated
8994081 therefore we believe there remains a high likelihood of additional weakness to earnings estimates heading into the months ahead until analysts and companies alike become even more conservative with their assumptions
8994082 the stock market is telling us we have a greater likelihood of recession
8994083 odds are increasing that the economy is slipping into recession
8994084 there is no clarity on the health of the global economy but we are still viewing july 15 as the low
8994085 with no conclusion to the fannie and freddie insolvency crisis the lingering uncertainty may have a renewed negative effect on the markets

8994105 since dhrs creation 35 years ago under governor jimmy carter our states growth and healthcare needs have changed dramatically
8994106 this restructuring of dhr recognizes those changing needs and puts in place a framework for a more efficient effective delivery of these critical services
8994107 it has been exciting serving with my fellow legislators and governors staff as we look to transform the delivery of health and human services in georgia
8994108 this has been a lot of work and there still is a lot of work to do this is a step in the right direction and i look forward to working closely with the agencies legislature and advocacy communities on these important changes

8994110 when the demands of our formal education grow heavier a lot of us lose sight of this the pleasure of poetry is transformed into the study of poetry and its direct appeal to our feelings has to adapt to include other kinds of address to our intellects
8994111 am nachmittag trainiere ich im kraftraum in den katakomben des home depot centers der heimspielst tte von chivas usa und la galaxy

8994124 oberhausen ist unangenehm die mannschaft spielt schnell aus der kompakten defensive heraus
8994125 jeder der am zweiten spieltag von druck spricht hat keine ahnung was soll ich denn meinen jungs am 30 spieltag sagen
8994126 ich berlege ob ich gegen oberhausen mit zehn mann starte

8994268 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8994269 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche

8994271 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8994272 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8994273 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8994274 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8994275 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos

8994280 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
8994281 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
8994282 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8994283 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8994284 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8994285 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8994286 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8994287 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino

8994293 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8994294 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8994295 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8994296 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8994297 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8994298 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8994299 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8994300 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8994301 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8994302 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8994303 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8994304 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8994305 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8994306 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8994307 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8994308 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8994309 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8994310 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8994311 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8994312 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8994313 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8994314 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8994315 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8994316 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8994317 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo

8994320 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8994321 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches

8994370 although thats contrary to what everybody saw a week ago saturday because that was clearly the worst day for both of them i mean that was discouraging but for the big big picture theyve really done a good job and theyre competing well and doing a nice job in both regards
8994371 at least from the place kicking standpoint im a lot more optimistic than maybe i would have been a couple weeks ago
8994372 its very frustrating because its something that should be as routine as it gets in football
8994373 that was one of the things just move on past it its a very frustrating and disappointing moment but its just a matter of moving on
8994374 i went out and did what i knew i could do i didnt really overthink anything i just went in there and basically kicked the ball
8994375 i think that helped me out quite a bit as the season went on i tried to develop a routine and started to think maybe do this instead of going out and just kicking i think wisconsin was just a good eye opener just set up a routine but dont worry about it too much
8994376 overall in camp i think we were very good especially compared to where we were in the spring and even last fall
8994377 this year going into it i think were more confident going out there and not being oh well i hope we can perform i think we both know were capable of performing and how consistent we can be

8994412 understandably this topic can stir a range of emotions even among hunters not to mention other users such as hikers and bicyclists
8994413 undoubtedly there will be long term consequences if we dont address the decline in hunting and fishing nationally hunters and anglers have been the largest contributors to government wildlife programs for game and nongame species contributing over 10 billion for conservation and more than 80 percent of the funding our state fish and wildlife agencies rely on all of us who care about wildlife and wild places should be concerned its time we started to think about how we can encourage more hunters and what hunters are telling us is that they need more time to hunt

8994417 our proposed casino will pay a 30 tax on all gross casino receipts which we estimate will exceed 200 million if however any other non indian casino opens in ohio then our proposed casino will pay 25 tax on gross casino receipts if hypothetically an indian casino opens in ohio we would still pay a 30 tax because our amendment only pertains to taxable entities an indian tribe is not a taxable entity therefore even in the unlikely event if it does open it would not trigger the provision that lowers the tax rate we would pay that is our intent and our pledge to the people of ohio

8994486 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8994487 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8994488 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8994489 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8994490 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8994491 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8994492 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8994493 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8994494 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8994495 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8994496 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8994497 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8994498 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8994499 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8994500 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8994501 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8994502 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8994503 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8994504 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8994505 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8994506 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8994507 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8994508 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8994509 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8994510 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8994511 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8994512 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8994513 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8994514 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8994515 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8994516 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8994517 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8994518 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8994519 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8994520 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8994521 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8994522 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8994523 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8994524 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8994525 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8994526 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8994527 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8994528 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8994529 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8994530 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8994531 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8994532 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8994533 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8994534 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8994535 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8994536 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had

8994546 this means it can spot names or numbers that crop up alongside anyone already of interest to the authorities and then catalogue any documents that contain such associates
8994547 as a tool to help the security services tackle crime and terrorism
8994548 authorized groups need to have direct access to communications between suspects whether it is individuals groups or organizations only then can they take appropriate action detect prevent and anticipate crimes and guarantee peace and security

8994550 to anticipate identify prevent and or monitor criminal and terrorist activity
8994551 a vast database of names that feeds the nations terrorist watch list

8994560 the efficiency and reliability of such tools is as yet unknown more surveillance does not necessarily lead to a higher level of societal security hence there must be a thorough examination of whether the resulting massive constraints on human rights are proportionate and justified

8994589 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
8994590 we regret this step from the georgian side it will not assist our bilateral relations
8994591 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia
8994592 no moral right to the role of mentor in matters of international relations and to judge the actions of other states

8994594 well done to the city of liverpool and the city council for such a memorable long weekend
8994595 your full page story on wednesday august 20 said the shipwould arrive in liverpool on friday at 8amand depart the same day at 7pm
8994596 i collected my three small grandchildren from birchwood warrington and took them along at 6 30pm to watch the departure there was no ship no people no sign of anything at all other than the isle of man boat unloading holidaymakers
8994597 we were very disappointed as you can imagine having gone all thatway
8994598 do you know what happened did it actually come into liverpool that day i appreciate you can only publish what you know at that time

8994601 i cant believe a family paper in a city blighted by knife crime could include such a photo without editing out the unnecessary prop
8994602 young people are influenced by all that goes with famous footballers
8994603 its reputation as a no go area was allowing serious crimes including drug abuse and stolen property dealing to carry on unhindered
8994604 this is part of your life the decision was made last week to bring in shawn but we really need someone in there who can bring us back together
8994605 we were expecting him to be sworn in at the next city council meeting on tuesday
8994606 i dont know why it had to be such a secret
8994607 even if we were to try and give him a chance the swearing in situation was a sign that things are probably going to get a lot worse
8994608 the fact is that it was kept a secret from the department and if they are going to start that then i dont think things will change at all
8994609 i think shell be a great inspiration to women who see all the things that shes done and how shes been able to juggle her career with raising her family
8994610 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8994611 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8994612 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8994613 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes

8994615 as far as we are concerned this decision was taken some time ago and we made our case at the time
8994616 there is nothing that can be done about it now but 30 full time posts will go and it reflects the ever increasing workload across public services with fewer resources
8994617 it is still an issue of concern to us and there are probably people out there who feel the same the priority now is on prevention but that doesnt mean you dont still need an emergency response capacity
8994618 the county council is under further financial pressure now and i certainly hope there are no further cuts around the corner in the fire service
8994619 the progress is in front of us and all we have to do is reach out and grab it
8994620 once we go down this road it sounds like were stuck with whatever cost

8994632 there is nothing left of the warehouse but a shell the fire investigation team has been looking into the blaze but have yet to come back with a cause
8994633 we sent a paramedic in a rapid response vehicle an ambulance crew and an incident support officer to the scene
8994634 one ambulance took two men to walsall manor hospital as a precaution
8994635 more than 60 firefighters also had to be decontaminated because of explosions from the asbestos sheet roof
8994636 if it had not been for the professional and calm actions of the driver we would have been talking about the death and serious injuries of fire officers this morning
8994637 we received a number of calls at 11 30pm saying a caravan was on fire in a garden at juniper rise in twinbrook
8994638 as the fire crew from lisburn road station were making their way along stewartstown road they could see a ferocious blaze in the distance that is when they came under attack the crew proceeded on to the house where they courageously tackled the fire
8994639 there had been an explosion and the fire had spread to the house the occupant was suffering from smoke inhalation and shock no doubt if the crew had not continued on to the scene the incident would have escalated and endangered the life of the occupant
8994640 there was heavy fire venting from the rear of the house
8994641 the whole right side of the house was involved when we pulled up we couldnt attack the fire from the inside because it would have placed the guys in danger it was well involved so we had to attack it from the outside
8994642 we were trying to get it knocked down when it collapsed on the side
8994643 its unsafe right now to go in and look around and see what it is

8994737 oh about 180 million and shooting in albuquerque n m or hawaii take your pick generally though the actual working method is not really especially different on a big or small film maybe ben has more technical things to worry about but at the end of the day i think movies live or die on the small things the things that dont cost any money or those tiny moments that connect with people or not thats the same in a big budget movie or a low budget movie
8994738 tom wasnt on set for the teleconference scene he shot but he was there for a day of rehearsal at the studio
8994739 my job in that movie was to get freaked out by everybody he just eyeballed me and gave me that thousand yard stare that he can muster and he said all those pretty nasty things to me that were quite effective

8994777 michelle is not scheming like her wardrobe should make certain points
8994778 i was wounded on 28 may 1992 in my house which is in the centre of the city close to the presidency that was the night when the intelligence agencies caught a conversation between ratko mladic and one of his soldiers in which he orders his soldiers to burn part of the city and my house happened to be in this part of the city i was wounded taken to the hospital and stayed there for a month the bosnian serbs used a rocket launcher and shot with it through the city thirty six rockets were fired and one of these rockets fell in our apartment the previous day was the first massacre when people queueing for bread were shot at many were killed and injured the night i was injured there were many people like me and i was lying on a bed in the corridor of the hospital as there was no place in the rooms later i was transferred to a room with 48 other wounded people
8994779 the night i was admitted to hospital an elderly woman was admitted too she was wounded much worse than i the doctors were discussing in front of me what to do with the scarce resources they had whether to treat me first or her they decided to treat me first because i was young and had better chances of survival later in the night the older woman with whom i shared a bed as there were not enough beds died i spent the night in a bed drenched in blood next to a dead body i stayed in the hospital over a month to have my leg treated all the treatment was without anaesthesia
8994780 i believe in justice and i hope that his trial will allow us to learn something more about the reasons for the war and everything that happened in bosnia and herzegovina at the same time i am very suspicious that it can really bring us closure the war lasted so long nobody really helped the people during this period we waited so long for the arrest of karadzic and mladic is still free but the wounds not only those that we carry but the wounds are everywhere and this country is so fragile and i am not sure how much bright future we can have in this country as it is now so i am not sure that it will bring what we hoped for we were idealistic hoping that when karadzic and mladic are arrested that a new life will start for us this will not happen but we can at least hope that we can watch him in the trial and learn the truth about the many things that happened around us
8994781 people in the country realize that all the perpetrators will never face a trial like the man that shot me in the leg i will never learn who he was and what happened to him even though i would like to know i am following trials in the war crimes chambers on a daily basis and it is of huge importance the hague is very important but having the possibility to have the trials in the country where the crimes were perpetrated is very important for all of us it is a very important message not only for the people in bosnia but for the people in the whole world that it can be done it is still the whole process and the prosecution and the courts are still weak but they are getting stronger i hope that they will be stronger and able to deal with the most sensitive cases and the most important people who have committed war crimes this week 29 july the war crimes chamber pronounced the first genocide verdict in bosnia and herzegovina it was a verdict in the trial of 11 people who were accused of genocide committed after the fall of srebrenica seven of them were found guilty and they were sentenced to 42 years in prison
8994782 at this moment on state level the justice system is still not completely state owned because we still have international judges and prosecutors and the courts still depend on international donations it has to be a bosnia thing because it will demonstrate that this state wants to deal with war crimes on a local level much more is needed on a local level the system is underdeveloped the prosecution does not have enough capacity the courts do not have enough capacity they still do not have the possibility to offer witness protection much more has to be done on a local level than on a state level even though the state judiciary have to fight much more for their independence and the messages they are sending about the willingness to face the fathoms of the past

8994792 providing this information would be a first step towards accountability for the uks involvement in the us programme of rendition and secret detention and in the torture and other ill treatment of terrorist suspects
8994793 statements that binyam mohamed made in the course of his unlawful detention will form the basis of charges against him if he is tried before a military commission at guant namo bay a trial which would be unfair and could involve charges which could be punishable by death any information which the uk authorities have which relates to violations of his human rights or could help binyam mohameds defence should be disclosed to his lawyers without any further delay

8994802 at this level its all about opportunities and seizing those opportunities
8994803 its an opportunity to prove it again to myself and the organization and really to this league because you never know how many opportunities youre going to get
8994804 its important to come off the bye week and get a win thats more important
8994805 weve proven we can play with the west division beating them is another step montreal is 0 3 in 2008 it could set the tone for the second half
8994806 they were suffering from metastasing brain tumours caused by various cancers mainly lung and breast cancer that failed to respond to conventional treatment and were otherwise inoperable

8994810 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
8994811 we regret this step from the georgian side it will not assist our bilateral relations
8994812 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia
8994813 no moral right to the role of mentor in matters of international relations and to judge the actions of other states
8994814 even during the cold war regardless of political or other circumstances the soviet union always promptly met its contractual obligations to deliver energy to europe and russia being a responsible and reliable partner will also uphold such principles

8994820 many families will be returning home from cottages and other vacation spots while thousands of others will be on the roads this weekend to take advantage of the last long weekend of summer
8994821 our goal is ensure every one of them gets to their destination and home again safely
8994822 that translates to nearly a hundred lives saved since last year
8994823 i think thats a result of the street racing legislation where were targeting extreme drivers aircraft enforcement but also a lot of buy in from drivers themselves people are getting serious about safety
8994824 were looking for drivers licenses proper documentation log books trip inspections just generally making sure that the vehicles on the road are in a safe state
8994825 the maple ridge rcmp felt it may be an intentional act so they called our office

8994827 its always important your centre forward takes one in shootouts i dont think its a pressure you should put on defenders i was very disappointed not to be on the pitch for the penalties but when edwin van der sar saved that last penalty it was just an unbelievable feeling all the disappointment went straight away
8994828 the cfia is working at bilateral levels to convince the usda that its system is equivalent to theirs in order to minimize the need for extra import rules
8994829 weve contacted dietitians that have long standing experience in our homes and theyve never been warned about listeriosis or deli meats being a huge issue or that they should be avoided
8994830 the canadian government needs to be a little more aggressive in informing canadians of the risks associated with refrigerated ready to eat foods like deli meats
8994831 the provinces and territories require staff in these institutions to have a standard level of knowledge about food borne illnesses such as listeria

8994834 we have as i said put our money into this sector and we believe that these cuts will certainly negatively impact on this sector therefore we felt it imperative that we do step up at this particular time
8994835 people should see it for what it is with a health care crisis in the province ongoing issues at mun national media attention this week about unsafe drinking water in rural newfoundland and labrador and his testimony at the cameron inquiry starting to draw closer ramping up the abc campaign helps the premier try to distract from these challenging issues at home
8994836 its a cliche but in europe there arent look at the events of last night with liverpool we showed character i saw qualities and values that i liked tonight
8994837 who put the ball in arsenals net all of fucking europe
8994838 i think teams who have deficit should be kicked out of europe
8994839 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
8994840 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8994841 you only get a brief glimpse of sunlight before its cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains i would like to test myself in another top league spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities its not only the weather in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel joy throughout the week they work hard they only talk to people at lunch then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8994842 if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8994843 to what extent we can talk about happy people or happy places is it the place or the people my guess would be its a bit of both the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness
8994844 the only place in england that escapes our characteristic vice of snobbery

8994851 i think it is impossible for him to play for england
8994852 this will be his first start and he certainly wont be on for more than an hour after that he will need a recovery period so i think it is very very unlikely that fabio would risk him
8994853 its very exciting to be part of something like this helping find good young players
8994854 no club has defended the champions league and that is a great challenge to us
8994855 i have looked into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger you need to succeed and i am satisfied we are ready to go again we took an important step in moscow towards improving our record and that continues to be our next challenge
8994856 we have a very good team emerging and they will get better
8994857 we have the strongest squad in my time as manager at old trafford and whats more its going to get even stronger as we have a pool of players with time on their side some of them are so young that at times ive wondered how they have delivered such a technically high level of football but the best is yet to come because so many of them have not yet reached their football maturity i am thrilled to be in on the start of their great adventure

8994903 senza un accordo con i sindacati il progetto di rilancio di alitalia potrebbe essere a rischio
8994904 il progetto al quale stiamo lavorando un progetto imprenditoriale molto serio
8994905 il progetto a medio lungo periodo il lavoro da fare tanto e mi auguro che sia un progetto di sistema
8994906 le prossime 4 5 settimane ha aggiunto saranno cruciali per capire se si va avanti o no
8994907 ci siamo impegnati negli ultimi due mesi perch vediamo grandi possibilit abbiamo avuto molti incontri con possibili partner internazionali perch questazienda ha bisogno di altri alleati metteremo su una compagine forte per un investimento a lungo termine
8994908 perch il progetto potesse partire era necessario passare attraverso una procedura e stata corretta la legge marzano a mio parere in maniera saggia perch era pi adatta a crisi industriali che a crisi finanziarie adesso era necessario mettere in condizione il commissario di agire in fretta
8994909 posso dire ha detto passera che la totalit degli azionisti con i quali ho parlato e credo di aver parlato con tutti sono persone libere consce dellinvestimento che fanno che hanno analizzato il progetto con grande attenzione e il fatto che se ne continuino ad aggiungere imprenditori che nulla debbono a nessuno che nulla vogliono chiedere in cambio della partecipazione a questo progetto ci rassicura sul progetto stesso
8994910 oggi il cda ha chiesto il commissariamento che verr formalizzato a breve e a quel punto si potr presentare il piano per il salvataggio alitalia
8994911 ma andranno conquistate giorno per giorno attraverso un importante confronto con il sindacato perch questazienda ha s bisogno di essere ridisegnata ma ha al suo interno le possibilit per avere successo
8994912 e stato chiesto a roberto colaninno di fare limprenditore di riferimento a questazienda e lui ha accettato ma voglio dire grazie anche a sabelli che fin dallinizio ha contribuito molto alla realizzazione di questo piano a cui stiamo lavorando
8994913 rappresenta uno spacchettamento che scarica sui contribuenti i debiti i costi e gli esuberi
8994914 berlusconi stato il problema non la soluzione del problema alitalia se quando ha governato dal 2001 al 2006 il titolo sceso da 10 euro a un euro
8994915 il sindacato non accetter di essere relegato alla esclusiva gestione degli effetti sul lavoro di un piano sconosciuto rivendichiamo dicono il diritto a confrontarci preventivamente sui contenuti industriali del progetto
8994916 io non amo molto gli ammortizzatori sociali ma quando si sono esplorate tutte le strade e non ce ne sono altre
8994917 siamo molto preoccupati dice il segretario generale della filt cgil franco nasso perch lo scenario che si sta definendo avr un costo elevatissimo e non assicura nessuna prospettiva ai lavoratori di alitalia che rischiano di rimanere senza tutela
8994918 gli aeroporti di linate e malpensa e in particolare che vengano accolte le richieste della sea
8994919 prima di tutto vanno rivisti gli accordi bilaterali in modo da consentire che nuovi vettori possano impegnare le rotte lasciate libere da alitalia su malpensa
8994920 non abbiamo preclusioni a considerare anche una possibile riconfigurazione di linate nellambito per di un potenziamento del sistema aeroportuale lombardo
8994921 da come leggo sulla stampa gli esuberi dai tremila dellaccordo con air france oggi sono diventati seimila dovevamo mantenere con il precedente accordo una grande compagnia di bandiera internazionale mentre oggi lo stesso governo ammette che diventer una compagnia regionale diminuiscono i lavoratori e viene ridotta la flotta in questo modo si colpisce laeroporto di roma capitale
8994922 si tratta di un club con esperienza internazionale dunque pericoloso mi dispiace solo dover giocare la partita decisiva in casa loro e non qui
8994923 operare insieme per la soluzione dei problemi mondiali dalla diffusione delle armi di sterminio di massa ai problemi dei cambiamenti globali del clima riponiamo le nostre speranze nellobiettivit e razionalit dei dirigenti dei paesi membri dellue

8994931 overheidsbedrijven zoals belgacom zouden beter geprivatiseerd worden de rol van de overheid is in de eerste plaats de voorwaarden cre ren voor een competitieve goedwerkende markt het is niet aan de overheid om zelf een marktspeler te zijn met in dit geval een quasi monopoliepositie er bovenop
8994932 de overheid moet zorgen dat de consument profiteert van scherpe concurrentie dit is vandaag nog altijd niet het geval belgacom schermt de markt af

8994938 we were immediately dispatched to the downtown area after hearing a report of a car alarm going off and after our investigation as we got back into our car i looked over and was startled to see a torso of pink flesh covered with thick curly hair wheres your shirt wheres your shirt i started shouting while pointing at him before he looked down at himself and jumped out of his seat after noticing it was gone we looked all around the car and walked up and down the street but we couldnt find it it was weird but the truly weird thing was that he was still wearing his badge on his chest i dont know how it was staying up
8994939 its a matter of whether we can get an agreement to stop it or whether we have to get court protection to stop it

8994947 we never in real life tell stories in a linear way
8994948 i think that cinema is a very young medium and its beginning to find its own language and among these languages is the deconstruction of time
8994949 i have been obsessed with the weight of death over the living ones
8994950 my identity is constructed by the people that i love by the people that surround me every time one dies part of my identity is broken and lost i am obsessed at how that loss of someone that i love affects my own identity
8994951 im fascinated by how this industry survives how it struggles
8994952 i dont have to do it every time but its something that i really enjoy when i feel i meet people where were like minded and we walk the same road and tell the same story
8994953 especially i think now in her age more than when she was working in her 30s theres a strength with this leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch

8994956 efforts by certain parties to destabilize the country by attempting to seize power through illegitimate means and without the mandate of the people must be rejected
8994957 i will not allow disturbances to continue i will not permit the mandate given by the people to be seized
8994958 would undermine the governments financial position and bequeath a bankrupt nation to the next generation
8994959 there are sweeteners here and there but it fails to address some fundamental flaws in economic policy issues of efficiency endemic corruption and governance

8994996 this operator is hardly unique to groovy c has had it since 2 0 in the form of the
8994997 one of the unique features of this budget is that all groups benefit from it without exception from the taxpayers to the disabled all benefitted it is also the governments effort to avoid slower economic growth since the world economy is moving towards recession therefore we increased government expenditure
8994998 our deficit has increased because government expenditure has increased and we have also included new elements like food security fuel subsidy and developments in terms of social safety net
8994999 there are only two ways of doing so one is to increase the revenue base and the other is to reduce government expenditure and look into ways of creative financing but we have not made any decisions yet
8995000 that is anybodys guess we have to see how the price of oil plays out in the next several months going on into 2009
8995001 because one of the complaints of the people is the rising prices of goods and the higher cost of living so with the reduction of tax we can ensure consumers will benefit
8995002 most of them suggested that the government look at the uniqueness of sabah and sarawak especially in terms of its size the slower development and high poverty rate
8995003 therefore the governments intention to reduce the gap between sabah sarawak and the peninsula is our promise all this while so it is only proper for this budget to reflect our effort towards this
8995004 we are responsive to the needs of the people and we have to admit that people are very concerned about their rising cost of living
8995005 it is only right for us to address the needs of the people at large but at the same time remaining physically responsible and to ensure macro management of economy is on a sound footing
8995006 it is not right to label us as a populist government but we are a government that is sensitive to the needs of the people thats why we embarked on a lot of people centric measures and programmes
8995007 we cannot have sabah and sarawak lagging behind from the peninsula and we have to spend more because of its size the sheer size of sabah and sarawak is huge
8995008 whether they sign it or not that is another matter what is important is what is in their heart so far there have been no signs that they want to leave bn
8995009 but we rely on their loyalty to bn and that they would not sell their dignity to others

8995018 natixis is ready to write a new chapter in its history
8995019 we have suffered the consequences of this crisis which surprised natixis in the very first months of its existence
8995020 clearly we welcome the lifting of the ban we hope to resume work with our ngo partners in scaling up our operations
8995021 it seems unlikely that we will be able to reach out to all of them because the lifting of the ban was announced today and our partners still have to go out into the communities to identify and register the most vulnerable
8995022 plans to deliver seeds and livestock for the next agricultural season were also put on hold
8995023 without the immediate resumption of food aid across the country widespread hunger and worsening malnutrition will be unavoidable water and sanitation services are also in dire need of support
8995024 the lift characteristically excludes organisations operating in areas such as transitional justice human rights and governance and democracy
8995025 we hope that these modalities will not involve restrictions on aid agencies or local civil society
8995026 it is vital that non governmental actors are given the space to deliver on their mandates of support to poor and vulnerable zimbabweans
8995027 the mission estimates that 2 04 million people in rural and urban areas will be food insecure between july and september 2008 rising to 3 8 million people between october and peaking to about 5 1 million at the height of the hungry season between january and march 2009
8995028 based on twitters growth and brand dominance 75 million post money seems plausible there must be a pony in there somewhere

8995037 one of the great economic success stories of our time
8995038 the washington metropolitan area again leads the nation in business growth and a u s labor department study in 2007 noted that fairfax county is the private sector jobs leader in the region we believe our companies are the best of the best
8995039 these companies are part of a dynamic economy and business community that bolsters the quality of life for everyone who lives here
8995040 yes but we want to believe that there is a japanese people
8995041 the weakening of the nation state by a process of internationalization is by the same token a weakening of democracy
8995042 the emigration of important decisions to spaces for which democratic processes and institutions do not exist
8995043 the nation state is still the most important political space at the beginning of the 21st century it may have lost some of its strength but it remains the inclusive community for most people

8995053 corporations focused on efficiencies and productivity started to make research more short term and tailored to the companys needs
8995054 with the result that most research done at corporations now is applied research
8995055 if you look at problems in the energy sector today we could have used the seeds and investments in that field from years ago
8995056 if you go back to the original days of bell labs and xerox parc they worked with universities in a very open collaborative way
8995057 they were part of the research community if you look at corporate research in the past few years it has become more about research for the companys good than the good of the ecosystem
8995058 there are a few foundations out there that fund basic science research but a lot more is for applied causes such as education or getting medicines to those who need them
8995059 it would be nice if all these institutions looked into their portfolio and gave just 10 of their overall allocation for research
8995060 companies say they are doing research and development but it is mostly development and very little research
8995061 research at microsoft is very well led though it is still bound to the areas that are of interest to the company
8995062 still they are one of the few that are still investing in research

8995066 while her appointment comes as a surprise i am sure governor palin will make a positive contribution to the mccain campaign
8995067 palin brings administrative experience energy and gender diversity to the ticket she also has firsthand knowledge of the importance of energy development which will help keep the focus on this important domestic issue during the campaign
8995068 fills all the holes in mccains r sum it makes sense to put the two of them together

8995086 while we acknowledge that this was a particularly dramatic episode we were very careful to make sure that any actual violence was implied rather than explicit and it was made clear from the outset that jases life was in serious jeopardy
8995087 we do appreciate that some viewers found the images of jases dead body uncomfortable however in trying to fully convey jays loss and depth of emotion we felt it was necessary for viewers to see what he was seeing
8995088 we understand that some viewers were upset but we signalled the nature of the content of the episode through the pre programme continuity announcement and billings
8995089 this was the climax of a long running story involving jase and his former firm and we believe this was the outcome that many viewers would have been anticipating in the context of this storyline
8995090 while issues of violence and knife crime may be in the news currently they were not glamorised or glorified in any way within this episode rather we saw the devastating consequences of such actions and the clear message was that crime does not pay

8995102 she completes a strong ticket that will bring a real record of change and reform to washington
8995103 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party she is a strong defender of traditional family values with an unquestioned commitment to protect life
8995104 proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner
8995105 being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8995106 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
8995107 i am a proponent of teaching both evolution and intelligent design
8995108 and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution
8995109 it is a real roll of the dice and shows how john mccain karl rove et al realize what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election
8995110 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
8995111 after his attacks on obamas readiness for the job itll be amusing to hear a 71 year old with a history of health problems justify this decision

8995121 i heard every one of the songs that was there heard the finished product
8995122 im the average philistine at the opera who by the third act of wagners siegfried is asleep
8995123 im not the greatest choice in the world for this but im doing my best and hopefully nobody will get hurt
8995124 i really wanted a theatrical experience if i was going to do stage and ive never done stage never mind opera i want that experience
8995125 i dont want to muddy it with half baked film video stuff
8995126 in theory there are many ways you can do close ups onstage you can do it with lighting but i wasnt even thinking about that i found that i could direct the singers just as i would direct actors on film
8995127 that production was such a success that we are still doing it
8995128 movie directors see things in a different dimension they bring some beautiful wonderful refreshing ideas
8995129 if it hadnt worked we would stop but it has worked so we are enthusiastic
8995130 we approached david cronenberg and howard shore because howard had said hed like to do an opera and i said lets do it now lets discuss the subject
8995131 and he said no i dont think we have to discuss the subject ive already been working on a project the fly
8995132 one is already so bored as to strongly suspect the presence of the parasitical tsetse fly
8995133 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
8995134 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
8995135 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
8995136 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
8995137 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
8995138 earlier this year we undertook the largest expansion initiative in the companys history simultaneously launching 22 new cities
8995139 the successful launch of those cities has allowed us to accelerate our geographical development beyond the original plans we had previously announced expanding by 10 cities in the 4th quarter of 2008 but we are now fortunate to include 3 additional cites
8995140 id rather have people singing my songs than buying my cds
8995141 radio song that they cant write a song over 3 and a half minutes
8995142 okay guys you have to make sure every song has a chorus and its repeated at least 4 times oh and be sure to sing three harmony tracks over every chorus
8995143 trouble is only pulling in 30 50 people a night in the clubs they are playing i personally dont know how lucrative a pg tour would be sure i would be winning over a bigger fan base but as i said i am very happy with things as they are for now
8995144 stuffed and starved the hidden battle for the world food system
8995145 metrobridges second quarter results show the strong organic growth resulting from our continued focus on enterprise level contracts were expanding our enterprise level network in utah and anticipate securing additional accretive acquisitions in the future to enter new markets

8995154 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and washington second
8995155 there is an enormous talent going to waste in our parliament
8995156 if he is going to stay it is the big job that he needs to do
8995157 the electorates feedback to me is that under peters stewardship australia and the economy did very well
8995158 costello has that credibility and hes got a lot to contribute
8995159 i think his contribution would be priceless in the parliament
8995160 strongly in the interests of the liberal and national parties for peter to stay
8995161 this government will not be bidding for the 2018 commonwealth games
8995162 there is a lot better ways to spend 2 billion than on a bunch of sporting stadiums that will offer us a b grade sporting event for 10 days when australia can beat itself in the swimming pool
8995163 i am not going to see this state with the 2 billion of expenditure on sporting stadiums when the most pressing need for our state is economic infrastructure social infrastructure to underpin a significant economic boom in this state which will put enormous pressure on housing education hospitals road and rail infrastructure
8995164 mediations seven deadly sins avoiding the seven sure fire ways
8995165 our advisory subcommittees will play an important role in shaping the future of this organization laying the groundwork for the realization of our goals today we are a small but agile group of dedicated volunteers and we see these advisory subcommittees as an opportunity to involve the greater community and benefit from the collective wisdom therein it is crucial that aihsp be driven by its constituents and that the energy and founding philosophy be widespread among the vast spectrum that is the web hosting and internet services industry
8995166 the formation of aihsp advisory subcommittees is critical in terms of getting quality feedback from service providers and more importantly is highly relevant in the process of organizational structuration one of the most important missions of the aihsp will be to continually generate panoramic snapshots of the industry in action and build apparatus to address the problems and inefficiencies we find

8995184 herr mordhorst und ich haben gemeinsam berlegt wie wir das in j ngster zeit ramponierte ansehen der bremer polizei beheben k nnen

8995192 if the twentieth century may be characterized as the era of the automobile it was also the era of automobile regulation
8995193 attacked as orwellian when first introduced the use of radar is now a standard tool of law enforcement innovation in traffic management has not been limited to speed control most municipal authorities believe police officers have better things to do than to control traffic at intersections
8995194 allowing each municipality to impose different liabilities for a photo ticket as opposed to an officer issued ticket would render the acts uniformity requirement meaningless
8995195 the actual conduct prohibited exceeding speed limits is the same
8995196 the fact that state law does not authorize the state to enforce its statute through certain remedial options does not mean that it forbids municipalities from the same course of action
8995197 in the context of state local preemption the silence of the legislature is not prohibitory but permissive we have reviewed the colorado and minnesota cases and find nothing to dissuade us from our approach which is dictated by well established iowa case law
8995198 in reaching our conclusion we are aware that the desirability of ate ordinances is the subject of contentious political debate
8995199 the pros and cons of ate ordinances have no bearing on the narrow legal issue that we are required to decide in this case any determination on the merits of the policy arguments is not for the court but the political organs of government influenced by an informed electorate
8995200 for the davenport ordinance to be valid it must treat its violators as the legislature treats violators in other parts of the state
8995201 why would the legislature allow a person with five violations under the davenport ordinance to continue to drive when its stated legislative policy is to prohibit a driver with three moving violations in any other part of the state from operating a motor vehicle an unsafe driver in davenport is an unsafe driver anywhere else in this state by not applying our suspension and revocation laws uniformly our streets and highways become a more dangerous place
8995202 the uniformity of our traffic laws keeps the roads safe for all iowans
8995203 the legislature never envisioned that municipalities could raise revenue under the guise of traffic law enforcement at the expense of safer highways
8995204 shes looking at you ah no no shes looking at me

8995227 it doesnt show much commitment on her part to the poeple of alaska
8995228 her administration is already under investigation for abuse of power and shes got no experience i would love to see what a debate between her and joe biden is going to look like he will squish her like a bug
8995229 a s for that v p talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that v p slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question
8995230 hey she looks young and kind of cool lets vote for her and ignore everything that mccain has done for the past 30 years

8995309 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8995310 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8995311 inside gop circles thursday speculation swirled around lieberman it was fueled by reports that mccains advisers had asked for additional detailed information from him by mccains close friendship with the 2000 democratic vice presidential nominee and by word that republican operatives had been told to prepare for the possibility of an unconventional choice
8995312 this will not be a year of politics as usual it can be a year of inspiration and hope and it will be a year of concern of quiet and sober reassessment of our nations character and purpose it has already been a year when voters have confounded the experts and i guarantee you that it will be the year when we give the government of this country back to the people of this country there is a new mood in america we have been shaken by a tragic war abroad and by scandals and broken promises at home our people are searching for new voices and new ideas and new leaders although government has its limits and cannot solve all our problems we americans reject the view that we must be reconciled to failures and mediocrity or to an inferior quality of life for i believe that we can come through this time of trouble stronger than ever like troops who have been in combat we have been tempered in the fire we have been disciplined and we have been educated guided by lasting and simple moral values we have emerged idealists without illusions realists who still know the old dreams of justice and liberty of country and of community my vision of this nation and its future has been deepened and matured during the nineteen months that i have campaigned among you for president i have never had more faith in america than i do today we have an america that in bob dylans phrase is busy being born not busy dying we can have an america that has reconciled its economic needs with its desire for an environment that we can pass on with pride to the next generation we can have an america that provides excellence in education to my child and your child and every child we can have an america that encourages and takes pride in our ethnic diversity our religious diversity our cultural diversity knowing that out of this pluralistic heritage has come the strength and the vitality and the creativity that has made us great and will keep us great we can have an american government that does not oppress or spy on its own people but respects our dignity and our privacy and our right to be let alone we can have an america where freedom on the one hand and equality on the other hand are mutually supportive and not in conflict and where the dreams of our nations first leaders are fully realized in our own day and age and we can have an america which harnesses the idealism of the student the compassion of a nurse or the social worker the determination of a farmer the wisdom of a teacher the practicality of the business leader the experience of the senior citizen and the hope of a laborer to build a better life for us all and we can have it and were going to have it as ive said many times before we can have an american president who does not govern with negativism and fear of the future but with vigor and vision and aggressive leadership a president whos not isolated from the people but who feels your pain and shares your dreams and takes his strength and his wisdom and his courage from you i see an america on the move again united a diverse and vital and tolerant nation entering our third century with pride and confidence an america that lives up to the majesty of our constitution and the simple decency of our people this is the america we want this is the america that we will have we will go forward from this convention with some differences of opinion perhaps but nevertheless united in a calm determination to make our country large and driving and generous in spirit once again ready to embark on great national deeds and once again as brothers and sisters our hearts will swell with pride to call ourselves americans

8995319 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8995320 from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt now theres a pattern here barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbitt ran for president and he lost now speaking for myself and for at least this next election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8995321 john mccain has no problem hitting the snooze button on the economy because hes never been a part of the middle class and i would say to him sen mccain its time for your wake up call because we just cant afford more of the same
8995322 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8995323 the question in this race is which of the candidates will make the change that will restore the promise of america is it john mccain no im shocked maybe thats because john mccain continues to claim that president bushs policies have been great for the economy in 2007 john mccain voted with the administration 95 of the time so if he is the answer the question must be ridiculous
8995324 even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8995325 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8995326 i am honored to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8995327 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8995328 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8995329 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8995330 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8995331 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8995332 and this has been made clear to mccain by none other than joe lieberman himself
8995333 mccain knows biden well he knows how good he is as a knife fighter hell take mccain apart
8995334 warner get a real job no ones going to want a phone in the car
8995335 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8995336 nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
8995337 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w bush i havent heard any of this we are a country that is in a borderline recession we are an 80 percent wrong track country health care energy i havent heard anything about gas prices
8995338 i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
8995339 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8995340 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8995341 whether we supported hillary or not we are one party
8995342 i find it perplexing that they make us feel like outliers or rogues because at the convention we plan to vote for the candidate we were elected to vote for
8995343 if he said clinton was on the shortlist and did not vet her at all what does that say about the veracity of his words my intent was to come to denver with an open mind how all of us would be treated is a measure of how inclusive obamas campaign and presidency would be his campaign is all about post partisan washington but if he cant even do it with his own party how can he do it as president
8995344 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
8995345 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
8995346 she wants to reassert her relevance and introduce a new political identity
8995347 i think she understands that if she runs again she has to run a different style of campaign
8995348 and shes got a huge opening right now for the first time in her career she actually has a base to invigorate at the beginning of the 08 campaign she was the issue she had to explain herself her celebrity now shes got a base the working class and she needs to speak to them
8995349 i think youll be able to imagine many things senator mccain will be able to say
8995350 hes never been the president but he will put forth his lifetime of experience i will put forth my lifetime of experience senator obama will put forth a speech he made in 2002
8995351 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am mr
8995352 shes got grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good and what is right and that is exactly what we need in washington today
8995353 as the mother of one of those soldiers and as commander of the alaska national guard thats the kind of man that i want as our commander in chief
8995354 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
8995355 she stands up for what is right and she doesnt let anybody tell her to sit down
8995356 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
8995357 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8995358 the women of america are not finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling
8995359 i promised todd a little anniversary present and hopefully he knows i did deliver
8995360 to be honest i would have preferred mitt romney over everyone really because hes conservative and just embodies the republican base
8995361 the most famous bike in japan is the honda super cub here a never before seen high speed action super cub movie is born our hero delivers soba japanese noodles to customers on his bike not only for his job he also heats up his super cub for his friends this tense action movie delivers love friendship and soba the world was starving for such an unusual action movie
8995362 he either put it with a fluid and drank it or put it with a food and ate it
8995363 weve been able to pick things that offer the biggest value
8995364 a strong indication of the macro environment getting a lot worse
8995365 er ver nderte die art wie filme gemacht werden er berzeugte die konsumenten zur digitalen musik zu wechseln und gestaltete das mobiltelefon neu
8995366 shes exactly what this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
8995367 it was a very special time for us all he won gold which was incredible
8995368 i videoed not only the races but the family in the stand and their reactions
8995369 we can get the coverage from the bbc but we cant get that special coverage that you get using your own camcorder
8995370 so they willingly allowed the pretence to continue issuing threats to mr patels family over the telephone
8995371 the victims here were the mother and brother of mr patel and they were in genuine fear of his safety
8995372 it is proper and a valid point to distinguish that the idea came from the victim and the defendants latched on to that idea
8995373 lisa contacted tracesmart looking to find her father whom she had never met her parents had split up when she was a baby and her mother moved to belfast that was 21 years ago
8995374 when i last spoke to lisa she had travelled to blackpool with her husband and children to meet her dad i believe they met for the first time yesterday
8995375 the missing persons campaign has been a great success for tracesmart and our reunited customers lisa and her fathers story is another example of just how easy it can be to track down a lost loved one using our search facility the media has been keen to feature our reunion stories and hopefully it will encourage more people to start searching for their long lost friends or relatives
8995376 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
8995377 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia
8995378 the reasonable action to be undertaken was the cut off of diplomatic relations as a temporary measure after the end of the occupation of the territory we will see when and how that can be restored
8995379 we regret this step from the georgian side it will not assist our bilateral relations
8995380 orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation
8995381 russian armed forces including so called peacekeepers are declared as occupying armed forces
8995382 the talks are resuming today those groups are in south africa at the moment talks will resume today in order to finalise all outstanding matters
8995383 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political of outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
8995384 it is not true that mdc delegation has arrived in south africa for the talks
8995385 our negotiators are in south africa for the talks the talks are resuming this weekend
8995386 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humamanitarian crisis
8995387 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground
8995388 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
8995389 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8995390 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
8995391 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
8995392 there are now up to three thousand police deployed outside government house
8995393 i am convinced that the military will not forcibly crack down on us
8995394 pad must go ahead and intensify the protest we think that more unions will join us and it will lead to more airport closures
8995395 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
8995396 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8995397 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8995398 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8995399 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8995400 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8995401 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8995402 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8995403 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
8995404 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8995405 challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
8995406 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
8995407 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8995408 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8995409 theres also this issue that on april 18th she gave birth to a baby with downs syndrome children with downs syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
8995410 this is a home run she is a reformer governor who is solidly pro life and a person of deep christian faith and she is really one of the bright shining new stars in the republican firmament
8995411 ill not let the situation get worse when it comes to a certain point ill take care of it
8995412 if he cannot manage the situation successfully he cannot hold on to power too long
8995413 symbolically he is not in control he has to fight back
8995414 i am a bigoted greek in the condemnation of the roman architecture
8995415 o ur religion requires a church wholly different from the temple our legislative assemblies and our courts of justice buildings of entirely different principles from their basilicas and our amusements could not possibly be performed in their theatres or amphitheatres
8995416 a senator who votes 90 percent of the time with a president whose policies have devastated our economy
8995417 this election is about the choice between more of the same old policies that have gotten us where we are today or a new direction that will get this economy working again for middle class families
8995418 when i was governor i worked with a republican legislature to find real solutions for new hampshire families
8995419 this is a critical election we are facing this fall
8995420 im supporting jeanne shaheen because she will work to get our economy moving again she kept our tax burden the lowest in the nation and she worked across the aisle to do it we need a new direction in washington this fall and that is why im proud to support jeanne shaheen for senate
8995421 for too long john sununu and george bush have used their positions in washington to put extreme ideologies ahead of science and common sense
8995422 im proud to be a republican for shaheen because she will bring new hope to millions of american families by investing in and encouraging the stem cell research that holds so much promise for new treatments and cures jeanne shaheen has the courage and leadership to take our country in a new direction and thats why im proud to support her candidacy for the senate
8995423 having the primary on top of the holiday season just barely a few days after the iowa caucus i think does a great disservice to the voters
8995424 the idea that we had holiday greeting television ads was just unbelievable
8995425 in terms of our standing in the world last year at under 19 level and this year at under 20 weve finished in the world top four and thats very promising
8995426 but whats also very promising is the number of people coming through some of whom have started playing regional rugby people like dan biggar sam warburton darren evans gareth owen and jonathan davies
8995427 these are all people playing some form of regional rugby and its very encouraging that they are making a stand on the world stage
8995428 tu s demasiado honesto que at irrita nem posso dizer que sejas honesto s extremamente correcto
8995429 look my mom already told you to wait your turn have some manners
8995430 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
8995431 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president

8995444 this is a move to peel off disaffected hrc voters i guess mccain thinks theyre stupid and willing to vote for any woman rabidly pro life an nra member shes not exactly a champion of womens civil rights well have to see where she stands on health care and equal pay but one thing this does is keep hillary clinton in the forefront throughout the general election well be hearing the phrase hillary clinton voters until november
8995445 once again tune into politics and karma will once again prove to be a total pain for barack obama and the party elders of the undemocratic democratic party
8995446 barack obama should have begged hillary rodham clinton to be on his democratic ticket john mccain may well be about to bring that chilling fact home to barack obama
8995447 all that said she doesnt have much foreign policy or any other governing experience which puts a dent in mccains argument that experience is everything but yeah this was a smart choice on mccains part damn
8995448 ladies and gentlemen in my estimation i think were ready for this threat
8995449 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level
8995450 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing

8995469 our evaluation of obamas sms service leading up to his vp announcement demonstrates the inadequacy of the sms technical infrastructure to support large scale marketing campaigns

8995499 youve heard about all of these political fundraising dinners hosted by washington lobbyists and filled with representatives of special interests contributions like these are at the root of whats wrong with politics and john mccain and hillary clinton have built campaigns fueled by them but our campaign is different in february alone more than 94 of our donors gave in amounts of 200 or less meanwhile campaign finance reports show that donations of 200 or less make up just 13 of senator mccains total campaign funds and only 26 of senator clintons our funding comes from a movement of more than one million people giving whatever they can afford

8995502 i am with you on everything but the abortion rights i know many freethinking liberals that feel the same way abortion does not birth control stem cell research does not abortion why is abortion seen as such a fundamental right or necessary or needed to be lumped in with all the other liberal ideals this drives me nuts i will happily support all other liberal agendas but not that one labeling babies as fetuses doesnt change a thing by the time most women are having abortions they most certainly are babies being dependent and helpless does not give us the right to take their human lives a newborn is dependent and helpless and not fully developed and cramps their mothers style too but no one would ever think its okay to rip them into pieces or dissolve them or any other such atrocity abortion isnt necessary to avoid overpopulation or unwanted children or even to allow people to f ck like selfish irresponsible bunnies that dont acknowledge that what they are doing is an act of reproduction particularly now that we have the morning after pill if you dont want a baby dont have sex use birth control get sterilized take the morning after pill give it up for adoption you dont need an abortion i dont think that women should be prosecuted but those performing them certainly should be if democrats could leave this issue behind they would win every time
8995503 abortion rates are no lower overall in areas where abortion is generally restricted by law and where many abortions are performed under unsafe conditions than in areas where abortion is legally permitted

8995733 montagmorgens haben wir uns oft verabschiedet indem wir uns liebten
8995734 aus dem werk 1992 passierte es dann w hrend des liebesspiels bekam jim eine herzattacke
8995735 ich war so stolz auf ihn und wollte allen meinen jim zeigen und sein bestes st ck
8995736 meine mutter hatte sich 1991 in den kopf geschossen ich habe die urne mit ihrer asche vor einem jahr aus bayern zu mir nach mallorca geflogen es ist eine art wiedergutmachung sie jetzt f r immer zu mir geholt zu haben ich will jetzt die n he zu ihr aufbauen die ich zu ihren lebzeiten nicht hatte
8995737 sie hatte wundersch ne pechschwarze haare die oft zu einem zopf zusammengeknotet waren als sie starb wurden ihr die haare abgeschnitten und diesen zopf habe ich er f hlt sich an wie sich die haare meiner mutter angef hlt hatten als sie noch lebte
8995738 als meine mutter 1963 aus rum nien nach deutschland ging hat sie ihre kranke mutter zur ckgelassen die auf ihre hilfe angewiesen war sie ist weggegangen damit ich eine bessere zukunft habe und nicht in armut aufwachsen muss
8995739 meine mutter musste sich zwischen mir und ihrer mutter entscheiden das ist eine belastung mit der sie leben musste und die dann irgendwann wie ein bumerang zur ckkam
8995740 ich habe nie zeit f r meine mutter gehabt das bereue ich zutiefst ich w rde ihr gern sagen dass es mir leid tut dass ich mich nicht um sie gek mmert habe dass ich zu jung war und zu selbstbesch ftigt um auf ihre themen einzugehen
8995741 hier finden die generationen unserer familie zusammen yaris wei dass seine oma hier ist und ich will dass er die m glichkeit hat zu ihr einen bezug zu entwickeln
8995742 ich habe im fr hjahr erde aus dem dorf meiner mutter in siebenb rgen hier in die kapelle geholt erde auf der sie m glicherweise gelaufen ist jetzt ist sie mit dieser erde wieder eins und mit unserer familie das ist mir sehr wichtig
8995743 ich berlege manchmal was meine mutter wohl zu ihrem enkel gesagt h tte ich glaube es h tte auf der ganzen welt keine gl cklichere gro mutter gegeben als sie
8995744 es ist extrem tiefsinnig und emotional dieser song wird die leute erreichen
8995745 wir stehen alle in den startl chern wir warten nur noch darauf dass sich nastassja kinski meldet
8995746 gut dass manche menschen nicht noch l nger auf der welt sind
8995747 dont stand there letting in the rain shut the door and state your business
8995748 mr abel whose maps are the envy of cartographers everywhere and whose inks are legendary for their colors mr abel who is mapmaker for the wealthiest merchants and most particular clients
8995749 youve a silver tongue in your head i see that plain enough what i dont see is what your business is state it or stop wasting my time
8995750 mr abel who reputedly makes the maps for certain shall we say independent entrepreneurs of the sea maps that form a certain reminder as to where they have um invested their earnings
8995751 in other words treasure maps for certain pirates for instance a treasure map to where the late great pirate ignatius donatu buried his treasure
8995752 a certain conversation overheard in a certain tavern led me to believe that the current captain of the good ship goshawk the grandson of that same ignatius donatu might possibly be picking up that particular map first thing in the morning i thought that i might make a counter offer i am sure i can compensate you far better than he can
8995753 someone said that did they and was this person smoking gilly flower or did the bartender run out of the good ale and start serving the stuff they brewed with the moldy grain
8995754 ive been asking around and i know you sailed with donatu in your youth they say you can make a map of anyplace in the seven seas just from memory and some of them say that you helped donatu bury that treasure
8995755 i am sure that the map can do you no good here you need a ship and a crew to get it what did the captain of the goshawk offer you a share of the treasure whatever it is i can better it
8995756 now what would an old man like me do with treasure ive everything i want right here the captain of the goshawk is a customer of mine aye that is true enough he pays me a bit for maps but better yet he brings me the special ingredients i need for my inks for me those are priceless these inks i make are what make my maps special the colors the intensity and they dont fade at least not that ive seen in all of my years of using them these inks will make sure that the world remembers abels maps long after im gone
8995757 old man dont toy with me i know you have the map and i want it im willing to pay if you cooperate if you dont well ill just have to find it for myself
8995758 left your protection a little too far away did you old man youre slipping you havent sailed with pirates in years have you youve gone soft and thats going to cost you
8995759 ill have you know that that sword is the finest damascus steel donatu gave it to me himself when i retired from the sea your blade is bigger yes but not nearly so fine
8995760 i never said i didnt and its a well known fact that i did so what
8995761 ill have that map one way or another old man it would be a shame to get blood on that nice map youre working on now wouldnt it
8995762 was there poison on it id have your head off with my cutlass before your poison could even begin to work in my veins
8995763 youve been at your drawing board too long old man and youve forgotten how the real world works
8995764 and poison is a womans weapon you sailed with pirates you should be ashamed to stoop to poison
8995765 youll find it hard to make your maps without your hand
8995766 i guess youll never know if it was poison will you would it make you feel better if i used this instead
8995767 nothing here to stab a man with now is there
8995768 so if i were to give you this map what guarantee do i have that you would share the treasure with me for that matter how do i know that the crew of the goshawk wouldnt hunt you down and take it from you
8995769 i really dont think you have a choice about giving me the map but ill throw you a bone never fear if you cooperate we might even develop a little partnership you remember things make me maps i bring you a share and maybe ill even bring you some of those special ingredients for your inks that are so important to you as for the goshawk my ship is far faster than that old tub i can sail rings around her on my worst days
8995770 those inks of mine are made with truly special ingredients and some of them are quite poisonous
8995771 i have a great deal of resistance to them after all these years but you wont this one is rather nice it turns a mans muscles to water so he cant move at all easier to deal with a man who cant move and while youre waiting for it to work it burns the eyes and blinds a man so he cant oh say cut off your head with a cutlass as for poison being a womans weapon well you can say what you will but im an old man and i have to protect myself somehow by the way the first pen just had plain ink on it not poisonous ink
8995772 well youre a strong one ill give you that that much poison has killed larger men than you
8995773 now if you recover your movement before morning id advise that you be careful feeling your way down the stairs the railing isnt any too steady and it will take a while to get used to doing without your sight and if you dont recover by then well im sure that the captain of the goshawk will be happy to give you a hand out of here
8995774 in fact i know hed be happy to take out the trash for me
8995775 you might want to remember just for future reference that the pen can indeed be mightier than the sword if theres the right sort of poison on it
8995776 die stimmung ist gut otti und ruth rei en st ndig witze
8995777 der sex mit meinem mann ist als schwangere noch gef hlvoller
8995778 ja wir machen noch liebe aber es wird mit der gr e der kugel immer schwieriger ich habe immer ein bisschen angst dass das baby mir einen karate tritt verpasst
8995779 gummib rchen und schoko eis zehn kilo hab ich zugenommen
8995780 sie isst so viel haribo hoffentlich wirds kein goldb r in gr n oder rot
8995781 in brasilien sind kaiserschnitte ganz normal da machen das 50 prozent der frauen ich wei es aber noch nicht es kommt darauf an wie gro das baby wird da ist schon ein wenig angst vor zu starken schmerzen da das baby ist jetzt schon 44 zentimeter gro ich war bei meiner geburt ein riese 57 zentimeter vier kilo schwer
8995782 ich hatte einen riesenkopf das h lt mir meine mutter heute noch vor
8995783 giovanni hatte die komplette italienische nationalmannschaft aufgez hlt das wird aber nix ich m chte einen ganz normalen namen das baby soll nicht santiago oder paris hei en oder irgendeinen hauptstadtnamen tragen so neumodische k nstlernamen sind auch nix ich glaube wir entscheiden uns im kreissaal auch welche nationalit t es wird wissen wir noch gar nicht
8995784 auf jeden fall zuhause liegt eine liste an was ich denken muss wenns los geht im kreissaal stehe ich dann aber nur am kopf ich falle um ich hasse blut und falle um wenn ich im fernsehen eine tierarztpraxis sehe
8995785 ich bin der der den m dels eiskalt sagt was mich an ihnen st rt
8995786 es tut mir nicht leid wenn ich einer sagen muss dass es eben nicht reicht jedes m del wei worauf es sich einl sst und muss dann auch mit den konsequenzen leben k nnen
8995787 ich glaube dass bei deutschland sucht den superstar viele von den v llig talentfreien bewerbern regelrecht gecastet sind und sich ganz gezielt dort zum idioten machen sollen um dieter bohlen ein forum f r die spr che zu bieten die man ihm vorher auch noch aufgeschrieben hat
8995788 deshalb haben irgendwelche leute drogen erfunden um so was auszuhalten
8995789 weil man wei dass man von mir immer meine eigene hundertprozentig ehrliche meinung bekommt
8995790 es ist wirklich erschreckend dass viele kandidatinnen ihren text einfach nicht k nnen
8995791 the income side of the economy with profits down for four straight quarters and employment falling looks like a recession
8995792 what you are seeing is more legitimate economic weakness in the income numbers
8995793 the gdi numbers raise the potential that gdp is overstating growth
8995794 im looking at the labor market and the gdp income numbers make more sense
8995795 it certainly did not feel like 3 3 percent growth
8995796 has done a better job recognizing the start of recessions than has the growth rate of real gdp
8995797 placing an increased focus on gdi may be useful in assessing the current state of the economy
8995798 when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions
8995799 if banks are unable or unwilling to lend monetary policy doesnt work so well
8995800 the credit crunch is morphing from an american centred financial crisis into a global economic crisis
8995801 if it can happen to fannie or freddie it can happen anywhere
8995802 this is a cautionary tale you better pay attention to
8995803 its my understanding that for a fair number of people it was an important part of their retirement planning
8995804 if you joined in the 80s you did fairly well but if you joined in the last 10 years or so those options wouldnt be worth a whole lot to you
8995805 they had been doing this religiously over the years adding between 500 to 1 000 a month and theyve seen the value of what they purchased slip to next to nothing
8995806 if you are going to invest in a single security employer stock is a particularly stupid one to invest in because your human capital is tied up with your financial capital
8995807 does syron get the blame for not raising equity when freddie macs stock was at 20 that seems to be the distinction between freddie and fannie
8995808 someone was pigheaded and said i dont need to raise equity until things improve
8995809 i dont know if theres a higher ranking person at freddie mac that has the trust of the people and the street
8995810 are these problems that freddie mac is creating daily or are these problems because the housing market stinks
8995811 the loan portfolio they went into this year with is the loan portfolio they are going to have to deal with throughout this cycle so whether richard syron or michael phelps is the head of freddie mac it is the same issue
8995812 it was not an internal issue that put fannie mae and freddie mac into the position they are in so an internal management restructuring will not fix it
8995813 so the story line leads in two directions what happens at fannie mae and how soon will the same fate befall richard syron at freddie mac
8995814 whats good for jpmorgan should be good for the rest of the industry
8995815 the fear here is that the market participants most of the stuff was purchased by foreign central banks will see the risk and stop purchasing it if that happens then mortgage rates would rise substantially
8995816 the last thing they want to do is create another giant division of the u s government thats why things are quiet now this is a political football
8995817 the american auto industry is deserving of government loan guarantees
8995818 we have done a whole bunch of things that people said why arent you doing this
8995819 weve been hearing from some of our dealers that pickup sales have bottomed same with s u v s
8995820 there has been some resurgence of demand for full size pickups and sport utilities many people still simply need to buy a truck
8995821 over all the program has not been nearly as effective as its first implementation back in 2005
8995822 we have been going at top speed up to now
8995823 the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment has far exceeded the worst case scenarios envisaged
8995824 its not surprising given the market conditions but i think their forecast might be a little conservative
8995825 when the business environment is tough the stronger players become even stronger
8995826 you have less financing sources and the sources you do have today are willing to advance less money
8995827 gmac has changed due to the economic environment and it has put more strain on the individual dealership
8995828 increase its efficiency and productivity tap the emerging fuel conscious market with an appropriate product mix reduce our already competitive cost structure and restructure our business
8995829 are not different than that of other financial service companies
8995830 while the deal will boost capital supporting the remaining fgic policy holders it does little to solve the companys longer term solvency issues
8995831 the deals novel feature is the cut through which legal opinions withstanding may cause a succession event in fgics cds to mbias cds
8995832 the deal will allow fgic to remain technically solvent for several quarters but we continue to expect significant deterioration of its structured book and would warn of the potential for significant losses in its public finance book as well
8995833 were not done seeing headcount reductions on wall street in this cycle
8995834 for the franchise and shares to turn the corner we think management needs to announce a significant bulk asset sale or framework for investors to evaluate the structure pricing of likely asset disposals and incremental capital should it be needed
8995835 what they are effectively saying is that property prices in spain are going to fall by almost that much
8995836 to sit and worry about inflation expectations rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8995837 people have to start to respond to the fact that we are in a recession and the danger is well be in a very serious and long lasting recession unless we do something this is a call to action
8995838 certainly has a great deal of wishful thinking attached to it
8995839 i feel that things i have been fearful about have come to pass and i have actually been pretty accurate in whats coming and i have failed to convince the others of what is appropriate
8995840 people need to understand that sometimes you will have to focus on the timing of issues i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on
8995841 i thought 30 per cent was the potential fall we could see
8995842 i think that might even now be optimistic i think 30 per cent does look a fairly optimistic number and markets are now coming around to that view
8995843 prime country property was initially less affected than london but is now following suit
8995844 recent activity levels in the housing market have been very subdued
8995845 housebuilders in particular have been reporting significant reductions in site visits and reservations of new properties since this time last year in spite of a big increase in the use of sales incentives
8995846 the liberal democrat motion has been much commented on possibly because it reads like the storyboard for
8995847 it is alarming me to discover that people as esteemed as the liberals think that we are in the grip of an
8995848 because our economic fundamentals are right we can look forward with reasonable expectation to getting out of this situation the housing situation will be unwound in a relatively calm and orderly way which is what people need to know
8995849 this could cause liquidity to dry up because who wants to buy if they can only pay a higher price
8995850 risk appetite is low and investors are avoiding markets where there is political instability
8995851 the market is definitely in a condition where it will need some extraordinary measures
8995852 direct intervention in market movements would lead to further complications as we have seen in the recent past
8995853 most of this is just padding from lending related measures
8995854 it looks as though the genuine spending related components will be 1 trillion to 2 trillion yen spread over a year which is insignificant
8995855 the program earmarks 2 trillion yen in real spending but probably barely half of it will contribute to boost gdp
8995856 the government needs to provide steps to encourage spending by companies and households but no such steps are in the package
8995857 the emphasis of this plan is on helping out small and medium sized companies agriculture the forestry and fishing industries and other enterprises affected by rising oil prices
8995858 the ldp had to compromise for a tax cut because they are afraid of losing new komeito party support before an election within a year
8995859 these measures will probably push up the gross domestic product only by about 0 2 percent and that isnt much for the economy in a recession
8995860 fukuda just wants to demonstrate to the public that hes trying to do something about the deteriorating economy
8995861 das kunstwerk verletzt die religi sen gef hle vieler menschen die im kreuz ein geschenk der liebe gottes und unserer rettung sehen

8995869 ich glaube nicht dass john mccain sich nicht k mmert ich glaube dass er nicht wei was los ist dass er glaubt mittelklasse sind leute die weniger als 5 millionen im jahr verdienen
8995870 die republikaner nennen unsere gesellschaft die eigent mer gesellschaft was sie meinen wenn du deinen job verloren hast dann bist du allein wenn du keine krankenversicherung hast dann bist du allein
8995871 mein gro vater k mpfte im zweiten weltkrieg meine mutter war eine allein stehende frau die sich opferte um meine schwester und mich auf die besten schulen des landes zu schicken ich wei nicht wie john mccain sich das leben von stars vorstellt aber dies ist mein leben

8995884 wir haben nur mit der gruppenphase des uefa cup geplant doch in der 1 runde darf nichts mehr passieren
8995885 ja das stimmt schon aber ich habe lange auf den prinzen gewartet der mich mit seinem pferd abholt er ist nicht gekommen und ich finde diesen weg besser als mich in der disco von einem besoffenen abschleppen zu lassen
8995886 aber nicht wenn man so wie ich erzogen wurde ich komme aus einem sehr konservativen elternhaus bei uns war sex ein tabu
8995887 kinder sind noch so weit weg dar ber habe ich mir noch gar keine gedanken gemacht aber sollte ich sp ter eine tochter haben w rde ich wohl schon mit ihr dar ber sprechen ich finde das was ich hier mache nicht schlimm
8995888 nein deswegen zeige ich mich auch nur gepixelt und habe mir einen anderen namen gegeben die d rfen das hier nie erfahren
8995889 so richtig verliebt war ich noch nie ich hatte schon einen freund aber es kam nie zu sex ich bin so erzogen worden damit zu warten bei uns wurde nie ber sex gesprochen meine eltern sind ziemlich altmodisch was das angeht und auch traditionell so war ich sehr z gerlich und wollte warten bis der richtige da ist
8995890 nein ich habe keine schulden und mir gehts auch nicht um das geld es geht mir nur darum endlich sex zu haben und ich pers nlich halte diesen weg f r okay
8995891 keine ahnung ehrlich gesagt h tte ich nie damit gerechnet dass so viel geboten w rde aber vielleicht fahre ich in den urlaub oder ich kaufe ein neues auto ich h tte so gern einen audi a 3
8995892 das w re der idealfall der gedanke ist zwar recht altmodisch aber ich h tte an sich schon gern das erste mal mit dem richtigen mann
8995893 es muss ja nicht zu sex kommen wenn man sich nicht sympathisch ist l sst man es eben bleiben man kann niemanden zwingen
8995894 er sollte nicht zu jung sein am liebsten zwischen 35 und 45 mit so ganz jungen m nnern kann ich nichts anfangen und er sollte ein mitteleurop ischer typ sein mit blonden haaren und blauen augen das genaue gegenteil von mir
8995895 wir hatten seit bestehen unseres auktionshauses einige jungfrauen die wir berpr ft haben und die sich als fakes entpuppten seitdem fordern wir ein gyn kologisches attest und wir f hren mit diesen frauen pers nliche gespr che unsere h chstbieter sind vorst nde grafen rechtsanw lte und rzte wir k nnen es uns nicht erlauben in eine schmuddel schiene abzurutschen

8995897 dirk hat mir bei meinem wettkampf zugewinkt da war ich total baff
8995898 dirk ist total nett er war fasziniert wie hoch ich springen kann denn f r ihn bin ich nur ein kleiner knirps
8995899 dirk hat mich deshalb sogar nach sprungtipps gefragt will vielleicht mal zu mir nach dresden zum training kommen

8996010 seit mehr als 50 jahren versuchen die menschen in den industriestaaten mit hilfe von di ten und ern hrungsempfehlungen abzunehmen und was hat es gebracht nichts die menschen werden davon allenfalls dicker
8996011 wir menschen sind unterschiedlich auch in unserer verdauung oder der f higkeit unserer leber unerw nschte naturstoffe zu entgiften wir haben unseren k rper von unseren eltern geerbt k nnen ihn nicht eines sch nen tages mit ern hrung neu formen essen sie lieber was ihnen bekommt einfach weil unbek mmliches nicht gesund sein kann

8996093 dies war ein weiterer wertvoller tag in monza und wir haben ein paar interessante dinge gelernt die uns dabei helfen werden uns auf das rennen hier in ein paar wochen vorzubereiten
8996094 wir haben mit dem setup viele verschiedene dinge ausprobiert und arbeiteten am nachmittag etwas an der aufh ngung da es hier wichtig ist die randsteine zu verwenden meiner meinung nach haben wir das auto in die richtige richtung gebracht und wir haben eine gute basis auf der wir w hrend des rennwochenendes aufbauen k nnen
8996095 wir haben den tag damit verbracht uns das setup anzuschauen und alle f r monza spezifischen arbeiten abzuschlie en ist dieser ort doch im vergleich zu allen anderen strecken auf denen wir fahren v llig anders
8996096 wir setzten unser programm der vorbereitung auf das rennen fort sammelten daten und fanden ein paar sehr positive richtungen im hinblick auf das setup wir sind also vor dem rennen ganz gut in form
8996097 die wiedervereinigung der open wheel klassen im februar dieses jahres hat die indycar serie f r unsere kunden noch wichtiger gemacht wir freuen uns auf eine gemeinsame zukunft und gemeinsamen erfolg

8996099 wenn man bedenkt was alles passiert ist dann war das nicht schlecht
8996100 es war nicht fantastisch oder so aber das motorrad lief ganz gut und die reifen waren viel besser als in den vergangenen wochen daf r m chte ich michelin ein gro es dankesch n aussprechen
8996101 aber damit habe ich gerechnet in einigen der rechtskurven tut es sehr weh daher bin ich da nicht so schnell aber in den linkskurven zwei und vier bin ich stets bei den schnellsten die verletzung ist ein kleines handicap aber auch keine gro e sache ich will nicht die drama queen geben denn andere sind auch schon verletzt gefahren
8996102 in der letzten linkskurve kam ich von der strecke ab es war nur ein kleiner unfall also hob ich meinen fu nach oben damit er nicht weiter verletzt wird ich gab alles es war meine bis dahin beste runde aber ich kam auf eine bodenwelle und verlor die front ich habe alles gegeben daher war es nicht wirklich ein schock
8996103 aber ich freue mich trotzdem denn wir arbeiten daran dass ich den rhythmus wieder finde der mir seit dem fehlen in laguna seca abgeht ich habe im sommer nicht wirklich trainiert und hatte dann in br nn viele probleme heute hatten wir ein langes briefing bei dem wir alle daten analysiert haben sicher k nnen wir unsere zeiten morgen noch verbessern
8996104 grunds tzlich wenn man schnellster war im ersten training und dritter im zweiten training hat man erstmal eine gute basis
8996105 im zweiten training haben wir uns dann mehr auf die distanz konzentriert wir sind longruns gefahren die eigentlich sehr gut waren
8996106 das ist genauso wie die frage warum es dieses jahr so gut l uft keine ahnung es ist einfach alles ein bisschen anders es passt einfach alles ein bisschen besser vielleicht hat das auch dazu beigetragen dass brands hatch jetzt nicht mehr so gegen mich arbeitet
8996107 mal sehen wie das wetter wird es soll ja am sonntag die tendenz zu schauern geben
8996108 hoffen wir dass wir das hinkriegen und die richtigen reifen drauf haben
8996109 dieser dreit gige test hat f r uns positive ergebnisse hervorgebracht
8996110 wir k nnen besonders befriedigt dar ber sein dass das auto die ganze zeit ber auf der strecke zu 100 prozent zuverl ssig war und wir ber 1 800 kilometer abgespult haben so viel wie kein anderes team dabei waren wir heute besonders besch ftigt

8996112 you know when the food is really good especially for some reason italian food it kind of inspires you to grab a piece of bread and sop up what is on the plate

8996114 so the idea and the intention for this restaurant is to be able to just have an environment where it kind of invites

8996184 it seems some people have been questioning the validity of some bad press and the entire situation has once again reared its ugly head ill answer any questions i have nothing to hide i had several gyms in dallas which i left in a business transaction to my partner i moved to california and began getting calls that he was closing the gyms that werent profitable before i knew it the media was on the front step of my dallas home asking my renters questions and the state attorney general was calling me i flew back to texas and orchestrated a deal to have my business partner bought out and all of the gyms taken over by other local gym owners not one single member was displaced for more than two weeks and everyone was given a facility to work out
8996185 the articles read so much worse than the situation actually was i was on the weekly news doing fitness segments and giving nutritional advice
8996186 as an entrepreneur i had a certain amount of risk and my business closed im sure almost everyone can identify in some respect that things dont always go as planned especially when you own your own company i had no foresight as to what my partner was planning and would begin closing gyms upon my departure from the company that was really all there was to the story it was a business that closed

8996219 nvidia flatly denied it saying that only a small batch of parts delivered to hp was affected by the problem
8996220 of course now other notebook manufacturers like dell and asus are also affected in fact practically all notebooks using these gpus are affected by the problem
8996221 as much as nvidia would like to lay the blame on tsmc the guys who actually fabricated the gpus for them the fabrication process is not the cause of the problem after all tsmc makes a lot of other chips for other companies using the same process you do not see their other clients facing the same problem obviously the problem lies closer to home

8996237 non cambia nulla chi gioca la champions league non pu aspettarsi mai un sorteggio facile chi gioca la coppa si qualificato direttamente perch ha vinto il proprio campionato o finito nelle prime posizioni in tornei importanti come quello italiano spagnolo o inglese oppure si sono qualificati vincendo gare importanti nei turni preliminari ad esempio quando si parla dellanorthosis vero che per la prima volta gioca la fase a gironi della champions league ma anche vero che ci arrivata vincendo 3 0 contro il rapid vienna e 3 0 contro lolympiakos campione di grecia nessuno pu dire che sar facile affrontarli anche prima di osservarli e analizzarli ho anche visto lo standard liegi giocare ad anfield contro il liverpool sono stati spettacolari e avrebbero potuto vincere qualificandosi per la fase a gironi sono tutti piccoli esempi di squadre con un nome che non fa paura ma con qualit e organizzazione bravi allenatori che le guidano e che sanno condurle bene non potr mai dire se il sorteggio stato facile o difficile so solo che la squadra deve fare minimo 10 11 punti per qualificarsi e 12 13 per vincere il girone b il primo obiettivo qualificarsi il secondo centrare il primo posto perch questa posizione pu dare un piccolo vantaggio negli ottavi ho visto il sorteggio con tranquillit perch non cerano pressioni domani contro la sampdoria tutta unaltra storia inizia una maratona che parte domani e finir a maggio giochiamo una gara che non decide assolutamente nulla il campionato fatto di 38 partite dobbiamo vincerne molte pareggiarne qualcuna e perderne poche questo lobiettivo per la prima gara che sar sicuramente difficile
8996238 contro la roma abbiamo giocato una grandissima partita la squadra fiduciosa perch abbiamo giocato molto bene soprattutto nel primo tempo e dal 70 sino allultimo dei 120 minuti sappiamo che il campionato che sta per iniziare non sar facile e che la sampdoria una delle squadre migliori dellanno scorso sono arrivati dopo il gruppo delle squadre pi forti subito dietro al milan in casa hanno perso solo due gare ne hanno vinte tante e ne hanno pareggiata qualcuna sappiamo che da loro non sar facile vincere ma il nostro obiettivo sar comunque quello non andremo a genova per ritornare a milano con un punto se poi succeder non sar un dramma come ho detto prima questa una maratona ma dobbiamo pensare di andare a giocare sempre per vincere
8996239 no giocheranno materazzi e cambiasso e cordoba andr in panchina c qualche problema ma allo stesso tempo i giocatori sono bravi e hanno voglia di lavorare e fare di tutto per essere a disposizione il settore medico lavora molto e bene e questo vale anche per i preparatori in modo da recuperare i giocatori di cui abbiamo bisogno la prossima settimana in vista di inter catania chivu sar a disposizione e forse avremo anche burdisso
8996240 quando parlo o dico la verit o preferisco stare zitto prima infatti vi ho dato nove giocatori sicuri gli altri due non li ho detti per evitare di dire una bugia per quanto riguarda pel posso dirvi che in questo momento quaresma un giocatore del porto e pel lo dellinter questa la situazione non convoco pel perch pu succedere che oggi o domani possa accadere qualcosa e lui si trovi ad andare in portogallo non convoco pel perch non posso rischiarlo nella gara di domani quando lui potrebbe avere la possibilit di andare a giocare in un altro club luned in questo momento non esistono accordi pel oggi si allenato con noi e quaresma credo si sia allenato con il porto
8996241 per me balotelli un grandissimo giovane giocatore deve lavorare nei prossimi tre quattro anni per diventare un grandissimo issimo giocatore a livello mondiale per ripeto deve lavorare imparare giocare perch farlo il miglior modo per crescere velocemente ed avere unevoluzione compatta ha qualit assolutamente spettacolari sono contento di lui anche perch so che vuole migliorare un giovane che non crede di essere il migliore del mondo qualche volta nel calcio un ragazzo gioca bene quattro cinque partite e magari i giornalisti lo fanno diventare il migliore del mondo ecco mario non pensa di esserlo umile e questo positivo ho gi parlato con i suoi genitori e sono arrivato alla conclusione che vicino ha delle persone che possono aiutarlo a lavorare con il suo allenatore per lo sviluppo e la crescita di un talento assolutamente fantastico in campo un giocatore con tale potenziale non ha mai problemi di posizionamento il punto sta nella sua evoluzione e crescita tattica deve solo stare tranquillo in una squadra che gioca con due attaccanti mario sar uno dei due in una squadra che gioca con tre punte mario pu stare tranquillamemente a destra o a sinistra con inserimenti in diagonale balotelli pu essere utilizzato in entrambi i sistemi di gioco tocca a me lavorare con lui per farlo diventare un grande
8996242 linter pu giocare con moduli diversi in pre campionato abbiamo utilizzato il 4 4 2 contro lajax non ho certo schierato la squadra cos per divertirmi lho fatto per migliorare la mia squadra e dotarla di un potenziale diverso quando ho detto i nove giocatori che schierer domani non ho spiegato se giocheremo con il 4 4 2 o con 4 3 3 non ho detto se giocheranno balotelli o figo oppure mancini o crespo o cruz ho detto che gioca ibra e basta lascio aperta alla mia squadra la possibilit di giocare in modi differenti mario e ibra ad esempio possono giocare con moduli diversi non c un modulo che preferisco dopo il nostro lavoro mi piace avere la possibilit di scegliere la soluzione migliore per la partita che arriva e per le caratteristiche dei giocatori che sono pi in forma devo scegliere e la mia scelta dipende da tante cose
8996243 dipende dal concetto di fantasia da quello che significa questa parola per me o per lei che mi pone la domanda se per fantasia si intende un giocatore che ad esempio fa pallonetti o colpi di tacco forse ci manca qualcuno ma questa per me non fantasia per me fantasia giocare come abbiamo disputato i primi 45 minuti contro la roma con un pressing molto forte e unottima organizzazione difensiva con un controllo totale della gara con dinamica e velocit questa per me fantasia e nella nostra squadra abbiamo giocatori che hanno qualit fantastiche e che hanno la possibilit di far valere le proprie individualit nel nostro sistema di gioco nellultimo anno ad esempio non avevo ancora visto un giocatore cos bravo come ibrahimovic quello che fa di una qualit tecnica straordinaria quando parlo di lui o kak penso a giocatori dello stesso livello ok il brasiliano ha vinto un pallone doro che ha meritato ed un giocatore che mi piace tanto ma perch ibra non pu fare lo stesso zlatan della stessa dimensione calcistica di kak poi abbiamo mancini che un giocatore super creativo figo ha 35 anni ma tutto quello che fa bellissimo e non posso non parlare di maicon e maxwell sono due tra i terzini pi offensivi del calcio europeo insieme a daniel alves e a cole non ne conosco altri pi offensivi penso sia bello vedere maicon arrivare a 15 metri dalla porta avversaria come successo nelloccasione del nostro primo gol contro la roma questo significa che un giocatore che porta fantasia ma a volte nel calcio si fa un po di confusione ci sono dei giocatori che scendono in campo per i giornalisti o per i tifosi e tutti dicono che sono bravissimi altri sono un po stupidi ndr sorride perch giocano per i propri allenatori ma poi il tecnico che sceglie e loro sono in posizione privilegiata
8996244 penso che sia una questione mentale adriano ieri mi ha detto che la prossima settimana dopo che avr recuperato dal suo infortunio sar contento di rendersi disponibile se dovessi avere bisogno di un difensore centrale perch lui bravissimo la predisposizione mentale di un giocatore per la sua squadra importantissima ad esempio perch rivas ora infortunato non stava benissimo prima della partita contro la roma per la squadra non aveva alternative nel reparto e lui mi ha detto che avrebbe giocato se la squadra ne avesse avuto bisogno lui ha giocato e la squadra ha vinto purtroppo ora infortunato lo ringrazio ma ora dovr stare fuori un mese intendo questo per predisposizione mentale quando ibra dice di poter giocare ogni tre giorni penso che possa farlo tutti i giorni perch ha volglia di farlo vi faccio un altro esempio prima della partita contro la roma ho detto alla squadra che tutte le rimesse laterali di riise erano come un calcio dangolo nellultimo minuto del primo tempo ibra era nella nostra area per ribattere di testa una rimessa laterale del giocatore della roma questo significa avere voglia questi siamo noi
8996245 ndr sorride con lintensit con la quale abbiamo giocato contro la roma dopo cinque minuti di gioco anche lei sarebbe stato morto luis ha giocato a 35 anni settanta minuti con grandi qualit e intensit per me fisicamente a postissimo
8996246 molto bene desidera dare il meglio di se stesso per ogni gara che giocher con noi e con la nazionale svedese la prossima settimana la svezia giocher due gare di qualificazione ai mondiali non mi permetterei mai di chiedere al ct lagerback di non farlo giocare anche perch se io fossi al suo posto lo utilizzerei posso dire che se fossero sul due o tre a zero al 75 allora forse sarebbe meglio farlo riposare un po ma lagerback vuole vincere cos come lo voglio io ed entrambi vogliamo i migliori giocatori per le nostre squadre ibra deve giocare con la svezia rispetto lagerback cos come credo lui rispetti me giusto proteggere ibra in amichevole come giusto farlo giocare nelle gare ufficiali lo stesso faccio io settimana prossima faremo unamichevole a locarno e ibra sar in svezia ma se fosse a milano non giocherebbe credo che abbiamo bisogno di collaborare perch abbiamo qualcosa in comune tutto chiaro e non ci sono dubbi mai nella mia carriera ho detto ad un mio giocatore di non giocare in nazionale mai i rispetto i commissari tecnici delle nazionali i giocatori devono essere orgogliosi di giocare per la loro patria ibra vuole giocare e vincere non ci sono problemi
8996247 se dico di s domani tutti scriverebbero che mourinho vuole cassano e tutti i tifosi della sampdoria sarebbero arrabbiati con me sicuramente un grande giocatore ho pensato a lui durante la settimana perch devo preparare la mia squadra per affrontare la sampdoria e i suoi giocatori certamente ho rispetto per un giocatore bravo come lui
8996248 non un segreto che io volessi lampard ma non potrei essere pi felice dellarrivo di muntari in questo momento ho assolutamente dimenticato lampard lho citato perch mi ha fatto una domanda riguardo alla prima idea che avevamo per costruire la squadra volevamo avere due ali perch la passata stagione non ce nerano a parte luis figo e poi un centrocampista con caratteristiche diverse da quelli che abbiamo poi fiducia totale nel gruppo dei portieri dei difensori dei terzini e degli attaccanti si sono fatti tanti nomi che non sono mai stati veri ho sempre pensato a due ali e un centrocampista
8996249 crespo cruz adriano e ibra sono quattro centravanti mario met centravanti e met ala figo e mancini sono ali pure se arriva quaresma avremo unala in pi se non arriva devo lavorare molto con jimenez per poterlo schierare in quella posizione come ha fatto qualche minuto contro la roma
8996250 non saprei nel primo chilometro saranno tutti insieme a dicembre saranno davanti inter juventus milan roma e fiorentina con un piccolo vantaggio sugli altri in aprile potremo esserci noi con altre due squadre e a maggio noi e unaltra squadra ma tutte le squadre pi forti sono belle con bravi giocatori e bravi allenatori con tradizione e voglia di fare bene non posso dire che una sia migliore dellaltra credo che tutte abbiamo qualit diverse ma stesse ambizioni
8996251 nella mia prima conferenza stampa ricordo di aver detto che ci sono 12 squadre che hanno il potenziale per vincere la champions league poi ce n una della quale nessuno parla ma che per me in questo gruppo mi riferisco allatletico madrid che credo abbia un potenziale molto grande

8996291 i could have probably played another year in the league but i didnt want to move an opportunity to jump on the coaching staff came forward and i accepted
8996292 but the concussions add up im going out on my terms no one is begging me to get out of the game
8996293 it will be an interesting way to stay in the game and be a part of hockey
8996294 an opportunity to coach at this level is an exciting thing ill miss the competition you thrive on it over the years and the camaraderie with the guys but im not going cold turkey this will be a similar schedule without getting beat up every day
8996295 we are all here working hard to show what weve got there are no givens on any team no one is guaranteed a spot thats something i learned from pricey carey price every year even though he was the no 1 guy he showed you have to work hard not only to make sure you get the spot but to show the other guys how hard it is
8996296 obviously its a time for them to get a taste of the league and how hard you have to work

8996311 that will help prevent unreasoning in decision making or judgment misses and makes their own decisions closer to practice closer to the officers and soldiers closer to the grass roots and closer to life
8996312 we ramped up early and got some things in here but this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling

8996330 conservative women are the candidates americans are the most comfortable with we have that normal everyday life of wearing a lot of hats as a wife mother businesswoman there are a lot of women in america like me and like sarah palin who have taken very seriously that charge to be a wife and mother to have a career and still be a leader in their community and fight for keeping america free and keeping hope and opportunity alive and those are the reasons america is going to embrace governor sarah palin is that she ran in a republican primary on the tax and spending issues against republicans who had been too willing to raise taxes and too willing to spend money shes a reformer on spending she is one of the handful of governors who by executive order has put government spending online searchable she came up reforming that party defeating people who wanted to tax and spend who were wearing the republican jersey but not governing as reagan republicans shes very reaganesque in that sense and obviously her policies are spot on
8996331 i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket
8996332 our vp has more chief executive experience than the entire democratic ticket and i think they should take that into account it continues to play into the republican strength our candidates have more experience individually and collectively than do the democratic party
8996333 there is already a familiarity within the catholic pro life community with governor palin and the fact that she recently gave birth to a down syndrome baby the fact that she is strongly pro life and what this will do is bring into full effect in this presidential race what is the pro life segment of the electorate
8996334 sarah palin s record is not extensive just two years ago she was the mayor of a city of less than 10 000 people but what her record indicates is troubling this spring she opposed the listing of polar bears as a threatened species she supports the brutal aerial hunting of wolves and she has been a friend of big oil opposing a windfall profits tax on the oil industry that could fund affordable clean energy for more americans
8996335 i listened to senator hillary clintons message at the convention and the introductions of her i heard a party commending her for advancing what has been a long and steady road for the advancement of women in america but my point is that i heard them celebrating not that hillary clinton was a pro choice woman or that she was a liberal but that she had demonstrated the ability of a woman to step into the political process and compete i believe millions around the country no matter their views will look at hillary and look at palin in very much a similar light two strong and accomplished women
8996336 i could go on all day about this she is a mother of five she is a former mayor so shes had that direct experience with folks everyday whose lives she has impacted she is a governor she has had real experience at reforming government driven by a solid ethics approach this woman in 44 years has had a boatload of experience and i think what her selection proves is that john mccain is ready to make this a 50 state race that he understands that west of the mississippi she represents the values an the lifestyles that will play across all 50 states but especially west of the mississippi
8996337 otherwise it would be too inconvenient for people and will largely decrease the efficiency of the city
8996338 actually nowadays many ordinary people sincerely hope that the games could finish sooner

8996342 may be the biggest single year line item veto total in state history
8996343 it turned out palin caught the temper of the times perfectly
8996344 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who crossed sarah
8996345 shes a hockey mom she lives on a lake she ice fishes she snowmobiles she hunts shes an nra member she has a float plane and her husband works for bp on the north slope
8996346 i believe everything happens for a purpose in my own personal life if i dedicated back to my creator what im trying to create for the good everything will turn out fine
8996347 i get frustrated with folks from outside alaska who come up and say you shouldnt develop your resources
8996348 i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8996349 now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful
8996350 and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left

8996423 oh my god there are rats everywhere never go to the park move to connecticut you have rat shit on your hands
8996424 there are basically two approaches to negotiation the adversarial and the interest based
8996425 you can still negotiate aggressively on your interests you just dont want to be a jerk
8996426 real estate is a classic example of the objective standard you can calculate replacement cost and market value you can create a formula for value outside the transactions
8996427 people make an objective decision after they satisfy their emotional needs
8996428 really listen to what the other person is saying and repeat back what youve heard to validate their opinions
8996429 youve made the emotional deposit by listening so now theyre willing to let you make the withdrawal
8996430 you have to try to put yourself in the other persons shoes and understand his or her view of the issue often a conflict is not about facts but about how those facts are perceived
8996431 she didnt work downtown so she thought only about the noise from the train i commuted every day so i thought being able to walk to the train was a big plus
8996432 people behave based upon their backgrounds and experience knowing the past is a good predictor of the future
8996433 you need to understand whats of long term importance to all parties so that theyll be satisfied with the transaction
8996434 ask questions like are your clients in a hurry to buy or how long has your client been looking or even what is it about the property that appeals to your client youll be amazed at the information other sales associates will share with you
8996435 before presenting an offer ill often ask the other sales associate what its going to take to make a deal most of the time people will tell me
8996436 someone has to manage the negotiation it may as well be you
8996437 tell me again what is most appealing to you about this neighborhood
8996438 tell me what about the price seems inconsistent to you
8996439 people say things when they think no one is listening that will often ring true
8996440 often it wont be so it gives you a chance to clarify a position
8996441 always show respect for the other party and set a positive tone for the negotiation
8996442 buying a house is an incredibly emotional experience clients will trust you more if you appreciate their emotions their fear of getting a bad deal their excitement about moving their sadness at leaving their home of 30 years connecting with them on a human level will make the whole negotiation flow better
8996443 once he felt heard then i asked him to appreciate my perspective on wanting the terms fulfilled this set a tone of collegiality and it paid off
8996444 it looks like we have a shared problem you want to sell im interested in buying but we have some obstacles no whats your advice on moving forward
8996445 the crucial thing is to use your emotions rather than letting them use you
8996446 you can address anger by saying that your feel uncomfortable with the statement a person is making but never ever attack someone personally
8996447 what if we offered to reduce the price by 3 000 would you be willing to let my client stay in the house for another two weeks
8996448 such statements dont commit your client to anything but they open the door for a way to resolve a problem
8996449 analyze what and how the other side is disclosing information and use that as a guide for your own disclosures
8996450 youll have one batna when you begin a negotiation but once youve learned more about the other parties youll have to modify it still you should always have a point of no return
8996451 part of the salespersons job is to keep both parties focused on their goals that they want to buy or sell the home
8996452 sometimes they make a bad deal just so they can win
8996453 you have to differentiate between negotiating to produce an agreement and haggling
8996454 people who have made major concessions up front will perceive even minor concessions later as major stumbling blocks
8996455 once people have invested the energy in a negotiation the goal becomes more desirable always save the price for last
8996456 it works like a charm when the asking price and the offer price are fairly close
8996457 i know that this is 10 000 less than you wanted but when you compare months of 3 000 a month mortgage payments its not too off base
8996458 salespeople who get nervous during a silence and jump in with one more sentence or thought just display their own insecurity dont be afraid to be quiet and give the other person time to process the information youve shared so they can come around to your position
8996459 my seller could make the repairs indicated in the home inspection or we could give the buyer a check for 1 000 at closing to make the repairs
8996460 one of the biggest mistakes negotiators make is walking away too soon
8996461 if not i tell the sales associate that something has changed at the property and that they should take another look
8996462 providing new information is a great tactic for getting people back to the table
8996463 el cerebro de las moscas transforma la informaci n sensorial en una respuesta motora a una velocidad incre blemente r pida
8996464 exercised reasonable care in obtaining the square footage information and communicating it to the buyer

8996475 we are not sure whether he had meant outsourcing in the software sector or the manufacturing sector but i dont think the software exports will be affected or slow down such decisions to outsource are determined by economic considerations by us companies and they will find a way to remain competitive outsourcing is one of those ways
8996476 i will start giving them tax breaks to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8996477 us companies are facing shortage of talent to drive the growth it is in their interests mittal said
8996478 these are political statements made by a candidate i dont think we should react too much to it
8996479 there is no need we always provide supportive data to think tanks and other associations to supplement out position and would continue to do that

8996485 the electorates feedback to me is that under peters stewardship australia and the economy did very well
8996486 costello has that credibility and hes got a lot to contribute
8996487 i think his contribution would be priceless in the parliament
8996488 strongly in the interests of the liberal and national parties for peter to stay
8996489 this government will not be bidding for the 2018 commonwealth games
8996490 there is a lot better ways to spend 2 billion than on a bunch of sporting stadiums that will offer us a b grade sporting event for 10 days when australia can beat itself in the swimming pool
8996491 i am not going to see this state with the 2 billion of expenditure on sporting stadiums when the most pressing need for our state is economic infrastructure social infrastructure to underpin a significant economic boom in this state which will put enormous pressure on housing education hospitals road and rail infrastructure

8996502 we need effective prevention protection against discrimination reduced stigma strong leadership greater access to testing and most importantly treatment
8996503 capacity to negotiate safer sex and to protect them for predatory sexual partners we must change the social circumstances that will empower those women to say no when they wish to and to insist on protection when they want to
8996504 prosecutions and laws single out already vulnerable groups like sex workers men who have sex with men and in european countries black males
8996505 the person who passes on the virus may be more guilty that the person who acquires it
8996506 but criminalisation unfairly and inappropriately places all the blame on the person with hiv
8996507 those laws that target reckless or negligent or inadvertent transmission of hiv only introduce uncertainty into an area that is already difficult to police
8996508 in court we look back with a clinical harshness of the lawyers eye on the complexities of these transactions and i do not believe that it is proper for the law to do so
8996509 that i believe lies behind the enactment of these bad laws those laws seem attractive but they are not prevention or treatment friendly they are hostile to both and this is simply because they add fuel to the fires of stigma prosecutions for hiv transmissions and exposure and the chilling content of the laws themselves reinforce the idea of hiv as a shameful disgraceful unworthy condition requiring isolation and ostracism
8996510 why would a woman in kenya want to go for an hiv test when she knows that it will expose her to seven years in jail

8996570 whats significant about this is typically we dont know about new pathogens arriving on u s soil until there is some sort of outbreak and significant loss of colonies going around
8996571 and once the data is stored unknown sequences may be discovered and you can re screen the file without rerunning the sample it makes this a very powerful tool

8996645 tens of thousands of kenyans remain displaced living in miserable conditions in transit camps while ethnic tensions fester following the countrys worst outbreak of violence
8996646 kenya six months on a new beginning or business as usual
8996647 the report correctly points to the complexity of the healing process that is underway in kenya since the underlying factors for the terrible violence are decades old
8996648 some other independent observers have in fact described the governments efforts as encouraging
8996649 a key part of our reconstruction and healing revolves around resettling displaced people
8996650 that process must ensure that the marginalisation of some ethnic groups over the last 45 years is quickly reversed if we are to avoid further instability
8996651 that is why the prime minister who draws a lot of support from the rift valley where many killings occurred boldly associated himself with the resettlement drive in that province
8996652 which is severe and a threat to our stability but also others we are determined to end it
8996653 the killings were triggered by a very controversial outcome of the presidential election and the political revolt to this did take on heavily ethnic overtones in some areas but a large number of killings were actually the result of police shootings
8996654 it is vital that that diplomatic vigour does not fade as the coalition government becomes more established
8996655 if it looks like it is faltering ban ki moon should appoint a special u n representative to kenya to flag up the immense importance of the success of these reform processes
8996656 the relief at seeing kenya return to peace and attempt to rebuild its shattered economy should not deflect from the fact that fundamental problems remain in the governance of the country and that this is probably the best chance in a generation to put them right

8996740 if john mccain thinks that he can substitute sarah palin for hillary clinton in the minds of hillary clinton supporters hes sadly mistaken i know hillary clinton and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
8996741 shes been governor of alaska for eighteen months and before that she was the mayor of a town of 8 000 people
8996742 shes already under investigation by her states legislature they voted to spend 100 000 on an investigation because she is accused of firing a state commissioner who refused to fire her sisters husband this is not the kind of change that we need

8996744 what about the pull of gender politics will there be a large number of women independents republicans people who you all wanted to bring into the democratic tent in suburban towns and cities around this country who will like the idea of a woman on the ticket
8996745 women in this country dont want a candidate on the ballot just because of the parts that she has
8996746 they want a woman candidate running for president or vice president because they support equal work for equal pay they support a womans right to make her own reproductive choices they support access to childrens health care they want to make sure that we improve the quality of public education sarah palin is against all of those things so its not just electing a woman for the sake of getting a woman in there

8996749 do we have the confidence that if god forbid something happens to john mccain that sarah palin is going to know what to do and is going to have her hands on the tiller of american foreign policy what makes her ready to be commander in chief this is just an example of colossally bad judgment on the part of john mccain
8996750 is there has been a culture of corruption hanging over the state of alaska senator ted stevens congressman don young governor sarah palin they are all cut from the same cloth the last place we need to pull an elected official who wants to be vice president is the state of alaska right now they need to clean up their act

8996866 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8996867 rules and procedures that are transparent and rules of evidence that make sense and are fair these basic principles apply universally and without them the rule of law means little or nothing
8996868 it is quite obvious from casual observation that someone who has been known to have misled others including the countrys parliament has lost the moral authority to preach about the rule of law and good governance one wonders then what basic principles blair had in mind when he gave an almost unconditional support for the unilateral decision to invade iraq against the wishes of the international community and without the approval of the un indeed as late as april 2006 when an eminent british former law lord attacked guantanamo bay as a stain on american justice blair reportedly refused to follow suit
8996869 it is disgusting to see this criminal of the highest order being welcomed in malaysia and worse still to talk on the rule of law when he broke all international laws and the laws of his own country by deliberately lying and sending young british soldiers to die in a war of aggression
8996870 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
8996871 by supporting and participating in the 2003 united states led invasion and occupation of iraq i wonder whether britain being the worlds oldest democracy still possesses moral authority in a comity of nations to lecture on the principle of rule of law

8996902 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
8996903 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
8996904 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
8996905 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
8996906 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
8996907 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
8996908 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
8996909 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
8996910 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
8996911 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
8996912 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
8996913 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it

8996940 letters to my granddaughters insights and inspiration for a life journey
8996941 well were just going to tour really hard and hope our cd sells enough that we get to make another
8996942 the weather fine but man was it was ever raining when we recorded track three
8996943 this project was a chance for us to go back and do what we did best back when we did it he still goes out and does his songs the rascals tunes and i go out with booker and the blues brothers and do all those great songs but we dont get to write new music because theres really not a market for it so were creating something new here when concord got involved with revivin the old stax label and signing new acts rather than just releasin old stuff and repackaging old songs this was a golden opportunity
8996944 when it reached a point where wed written quite a few things
8996945 we said well lets keep continuin and maybe well wind up with enough songs for an album we were thinkin in terms of maybe just putting it out on the internet for people to download if they were fans of felix cavaliere and steve cropper
8996946 well see what happens with it i know its good music its no question about how good it is but can concord get it advertised and get it out to the right ears that might want to buy it
8996947 i let two generations of music get by me because i didnt really care about making that kind of music
8996948 one of them was when disco came in that sort of shot us all in the foot and killed r amp b in the early 70s then rap comes in and there you go again i have never been as successful doin brand new material with anybody than i did back in the 60s with stax because the whole market has changed now i know if i could get a song that i really believe in that i think boy this is the thing this is going to hit it and get the airplay that i used to get i guarantee it would sell big time but i cant get that
8996949 comedians who were making fun of pure real rhythm amp blues
8996950 eat that one one of the biggest movies ever made in hollywood was
8996951 cds were introduced in what 83 or 84 by the time 1990 rolled around everyone was getting rid of their vinyl it was pass records were not the format of choice at that time they were still around but cds were the way to go
8996952 i still had a good amount of dealers who wanted to do vinyl the other shows were primarily cds so i stuck with it
8996953 so im in the center of the state sometimes well do st louis johns show in hillside weve done indianapolis peoria and champaign and milwaukee johns is the one we just do not miss
8996954 i now run five different shows south bend kalamazoo lansing ann arbor and fort wayne what happened was the guy who used to run the shows about three years ago for a variety of reasons decided to get out of it i was doing well at all his shows and he asked me if i wanted to take them over i really didnt want to but if i didnt they were gonna disappear
8996955 i cant see doing any more shows than that there are times when im sold out and im sending dealers away id like to give space to everybody november january march i have to push dealers away one half of the year im not big enough the other half im just right
8996956 dont get me wrong we have rare stuff the records that never fail to go are pink floyd dark side of the moon the first four led zeppelin albums the doors gotta have jim morrison and if youve got original pressings of the beatles albums you will always sell out
8996957 led zeppelin beatles pink floyd rolling stones stuff we cannot keep in stock
8996958 there are certain artists we just cannot get enough in used i could sell them all day when were up there we do a lot of shopping to bring back to central illinois
8996959 its just a general trend as far as the used vinyl market were always getting some kids who find its an inexpensive way to get into vinyl theres nostalgia involved even for kids who grew up in the 90s theres been a general shift away from 50s and 60s music youre seeing mid to late 60s 70s and early 80s people who grew up in that period are getting a nostalgia thing and going back and collecting the vinyl they might have missed the first time through music that kind of was a forerunner to current music starts to do better people look for metal and punk look for older electronic music
8996960 she said turntables are all over her dorms and kids are buying used vinyl not cds reo speedwagon the beatles
8996961 his first big hit for your precious love was on a label called abner but the first pressing was on vee jay limited to 500 copies finding that first press is almost impossible a couple years ago at a show in indiana this man approached us and wanted to know who our high dollar buyers were i pointed him out to one and he had a mint copy of for your precious love on vee jay he wanted 5 000 for it he saw that price in a guide it was eventually bargained for 3 500 but there you go he just showed up knew it was worth money and we had the right guy to make a deal with
8996962 its in our blood i treasure all my beatles records i have first pressings on every one
8996963 look that sheep on the cover is going to sleep with a ball
8996964 max you are funny why are you hugging mom and saying goodnight every time she asks that she is reading a story she is just saying it you dont have to answer her all of the time
8996965 that dog is going to sleep with a ball too
8996966 my favorite part was when the stars spell out the word goodnight at the end
8996967 like jell o hard to grab hold of and constantly changing shape
8996968 a hundred steps on a walk in the san gabriels is a hundred images a hundred discoveries
8996969 to accept only a few discoveries on a walk is to loose the imagination of the moment and the magic of the place slow down and sense the wonder
8996970 i made it to the shower and barely got here in time for your call
8996971 i have a couple of appointments etc etc ive got a son who were trying to get out of here by the end of the month to go to the berklee college of music so my wife and i are preparing to make that happen
8996972 one went to the local university here csun california state university at northridge shes actually quite musical written a lot of songs and used to play around town in clubs a lot my other daughter got her degree in fine art shes going on to graduate school my wife is a really great artist she paints and has her own studio here at the house as well
8996973 i think that its really important as we get older or at any time in your life to keep moving
8996974 tourings a grind and it does get exhausting by the end of a leg
8996975 we used to be on the road a good portion of the year and we would play five six nights a week now its much cushier but we put in a lot of work we do three hour show the most we do back to back is two once in a great while we do three in a row but very rarely when youre on the road your job is to be prepared rested fit fed and whatever you need to do to be your best at the show and thats always been the case except we have to pay a little more attention to the downtime now
8996976 the mechanics the actual process is kind of the same
8996977 but the dynamics have changed even though we fly privately and have our own dressing rooms and stay in the good hotels you still have to be ready for the show to give your all as corny as that sounds we work really hard at doing that we soundcheck every day before every show and oftentimes go over something that didnt go over quite so smoothly the night before even if its an old song weve been doing forever we pay attention to pretty much every detail if theres a lighting miscue somebody catches it and we talk to the lighting guy we try and give our audiences their moneys worth and i think we do
8996978 ever since then weve decided to change our show up weve got new lighting a whole new stage added quite a lot of new songs thats tricky in itself because people generally are happiest to hear witchy woman one of these nights and hotel california so the placement of those songs the new songs has to be right
8996979 its nothing anybodys ever gone away angry about its obvious weve gotta play those familiar songs so its a matter of placement and a matter of where to place the new stuff too even though a lot of people have listened and bought the new album they still wanna hear the old stuff more we cant keep doing that for our own good for ourselves we have to have some sort of forward momentum hopefully some of these newer songs will join up with the older ones as far as people wanting to hear them were certainly not getting bad reactions at all from the new stuff but its not quite as familiar
8996980 do we hang out together a lot not much anymore were all certainly friendly and have gone way back with each other some more than others but this band has been together quite a long time and now everybody has children and families the other guys have young kids its not like were young our motivation is different we still love to do it and its obviously lucrative and all that but i think our priorities lie and i can safely say i speak for all of us with our families the well being of those we love and this just happens to be a really great job
8996981 youre seeing these guys before the demons started to hit them and seeing them when theyre young and just starting out
8996982 how do you write down blue suede shoes its all such an accident theres so much improvisation that goes along with it that its virtually impossible to write down
8996983 you almost have to do a nashville chart system to make people understand it which is a way of writing music down for people who dont read music like me
8996984 every performance is sort of like a concert where it essentially is the same thing but its not and thats what makes it so exciting and thats what makes people want to come back to it
8996985 in previous productions they had a huge rate of people coming back to see it maybe two or three times most theater productions once youve seen it thats the way that it is
8996986 i do small theater in l a that never happens
8996987 johnny cash is the first guy i grew up singing with cause the first record album i ever owned was johnny cash at san quentin so i pretty much memorized all the songs and all the patter in between so i had a sense of how he talked from a fairly early age like prior to my voice changing
8996988 so when it came time to do it i could sing like that pretty much as a part of my vocal development as a person
8996989 for me its a challenge and a joy its a joy to go up there and be johnny cash and sing those songs
8996990 who doesnt want to do that i feel like we certainly get to play rock stars for 90 minutes its just something about playing that music thats very necessary
8996991 if you listen to the tapes of the original recording its just a bunch of guys messing around they sang all those things that they felt like singing its not like they all sang their hits
8996992 weve sort of contrived it so they sing their hits
8996993 that song hadnt even been recorded yet but we put it in the show because if jerry lees there youve got to have great balls of fire
8996994 people are really gonna like this play because its got a lot of heart and soul and tons of music and its exciting and its like a little piece of history that maybe youve heard about or maybe you havent heard about
8996995 i finally feel non homeless for the first time in a while
8996996 i totally like new york have nothing against it other than things are so expensive i didnt have any studio setup or even a practice space because i couldnt afford it my girlfriend she was in magazines and doing a lot of super long hours she wasnt feeling the whole magazine thing anymore so we ended up choosing to move we found a house and went for it
8996997 i wasnt on secretly canadian yet or playing shows i was a studio hermit all through high school and pretty much the entire time i lived in chicago i was recording music all the time when we moved out of the studio i wanted to release something i didnt know what necessarily i wasnt recording an album per se i was recording songs that were all over the place song to song
8996998 most of the stuff came from a demo session we did last july a bunch of the people who play with me on the road just came into a one room studio at a friend of mines place we laid most of the stuff down demo style but kept it as the record i liked it did a couple overdubs here and there but the big chunk of it is from that live session
8996999 it was one i started to play live and i called jay up hey we recorded a version of it for the record is it cool with you if we use it he was totally into it thats the old old gem
8997000 but the records i grew up on were like most other people my age or who had parents my parents ages motown the beatles the stones fleetwood mac one funny thing i picked up on never having put a record out before was working on the one sheet promotional biographies for media and distributors with the label and listing influences and that the one sheet for the first record definitely said reminiscent of t rex and some bowie i thought people would listen to one song and decide im some huge t rex fan when in reality i dont own a t rex record maybe its a vocal thing i heard t rex after i had been recording and doing stuff a certain way it was like holy shit whoa its mainly the quiet double vocal and the tape pitch stuff
8997001 and maybe on moonstation it was more of an obvious approach of each song being produced like writing a song to have a very distinct vibe with the production going along with it all of the songs for that record were recorded analog by myself and it was experimenting with pitching the tape way up and making my voice sound crazy with effects and varying the speed with this record kind of because of the situation i was in i approached it naturally
8997002 most of the songs were written well before they were recorded i was playing guitar and singing those songs all the time in my apartment for a year before recording i knew which songs would be on the record before doing it its definitely a different approach from the first record which was scratched together
8997003 hi im john mccain this is a woman i hear you like them my friends
8997004 even though iraq is in a difficult situation we will give the palestinians the utmost care
8997005 i was born in iraq yet i am afraid of walking in the iraqi capital
8997006 its a crime committed against us by the palestinian authority
8997007 once this problem is solved they would be safe like other iraqis
8997008 in this country we have no hope and no future
8997009 well see how he is but i think it would be asking a lot to be involved in a game of such importance
8997010 youre always aware when you try to take a player from america that theres issues with work permits and visas but were delighted now that weve got him over
8997011 its maybe a bit soon considering we have a game on sunday but hopefully once he settles in he can show
8997012 hes a good player in an area of the field we were hoping to improve and hopefully once we have everyone integrated well see some benefits from it
8997013 there was a problem with the flight company and there were a couple of flight changes but it was nothing too serious

8997028 the advocacy center is still involved in this case and finds the suicide idea ridiculous if mr diries intention was to commit suicide he could have done so in canada
8997029 the community finds this recent ruling very strange i am saddened and still puzzled by this ruling and hope we will go to the bottom of the case soon
8997030 man those bitches really loved hillary if i can get them to vote for me i bet i can win this thing what if i ask my painted trollop cunt wife to run with me nah no one will buy that what if i ask some other trollop feminists dont care about womens issues they just want to see one of their own in power theyll eat this shit up
8997031 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
8997032 i admit someone with only two years of experience in a top elected position isnt ready for president but im not running for president barack obama is
8997033 nobody gets in here who isnt at least above a b cup

8997036 did you ever think that regular folks from the south side of chicago would be on the dnc podium speaking about their upbringing
8997037 i believe the role of government is to help the truly needy prevent systemic economic risk and enact reforms that prevent the kind of crisis we are currently experiencing from ever happening again
8997038 those reforms should focus on improving transparency and accountability in our capital markets both of which were lacking in the lead up to the current situation
8997039 this is a complex problem that deserves a careful balanced approach that helps the homeowners in trouble not big banks and speculators that acted irresponsibly i again call on our lending institutions where possible to step up and help americans who are hurting in this crisis
8997040 how it works individuals pick up a form at any post office or download the form over the internet and apply for a home loan the fha home office certifies that the individual is qualified and contacts the individuals mortgage servicer the mortgage servicer writes down and retires the existing loan which is replaced by an fha guaranteed home loan from a lender
8997041 get michelle malkin dont let her leave get on her
8997042 hes not an anti war candidate hes billing himself as that its not true
8997043 we love our country but hate our government and its not going to get any better over there just as bush stole the presidency from gore obama stole the democratic nomination from hillary clinton
8997044 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8997045 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral
8997046 candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that sen mccain wrote
8997047 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8997048 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8997049 unless the state of texas violates its own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot texas law makes no exceptions for missing deadlines
8997050 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8997051 i think it must be because billy made a lot of enemies when he was a player but i tell you what he is as smart as a whip someone is going to get darn lucky in this league they just have to take a chance i talked to the maloofs about him when they were looking for a coach last year and they would have talked to him but geoff petrie wasnt interested

8997062 my pleasure david i guess coming that close to winning stokes the articulate fire in your soul
8997063 stellaa im not telling her how to live her life im telling john mccain how not to pick a running mate
8997064 gt gt would you be offended by a male who had a down syndrome child for accepting a vp slot
8997065 and let me make it clear im not so much offended by palins choice im offended by mccains choice
8997066 stellaa shes the one who made this a public issue by taking her test results public and giving speeches about her nobility in bringing a downs child into the world
8997067 suck it up im running a state and running for vp and my child is just fine
8997068 wtf seriously i would love to come up with something more witty or urbane than that but what the hell
8997069 i think parental influence is huge personally my grandmother has a statue of jfk next to her picture of jesus on the mantle in the living room i am afraid if i voted republican she would sense a disturbance in the force good for you for passing the torch
8997070 as one of the new folks i dont expect anyone to read my blog okay maybe my husband

8997072 hundreds of buses and emergency shelters to help residents flee should gustav strike as expected
8997073 to the city due to 126 billion in disaster aid sent to the region in the last three years
8997074 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
8997075 in 2005 bush did not organize a federal response to katrina
8997076 one of the the most extraordinary displays of scams schemes and stupefying bureaucratic bungles in modern history
8997077 part of the problem is the federal road home program which is
8997078 in new orleans 4 of every 5 road home recipients rebuilding their homes
8997079 only 13 of the 1 6 billion in the states emergency community development block grant funds
8997080 three years after hurricane katrina the worlds media has lost sight of the ongoing misery in new orleans
8997081 coverage by the international and national news media in the run up to the anniversary is negligible one of the worlds most cataclysmic natural disasters one made worse by official incompetence and corruption is
8997082 i dont think we are on peoples minds we have to contend with those voices particularly on pop radio which say new orleanians with their eternal whining why dont they pull themselves up by their boot straps
8997083 i wondered a year and a half ago whether there would ever come a time when the word hurricane or katrina would not appear on or near page one of the times picayune there have been some days when there hasnt been a single story on page one but that is still a rarity because
8997084 what im hearing which is sort of scary is that they all want to stay in texas everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality and so many of the people in the arena here you know were underprivileged anyway so this chuckle this is working very well for them
8997085 considering the dire circumstances that we have in new orleans virtually a city that has been destroyed things are going relatively well
8997086 now tell me the truth boys is this kind of fun
8997087 you simply get chills every time you see these poor individuals many of these people almost all of them that we see are so poor and they are so black and this is going to raise lots of questions for people who are watching this story unfold
8997088 we finally cleaned up public housing in new orleans we couldnt do it but god did
8997089 i have not heard a report of thousands of people in the convention center who dont have food and water
8997090 i dont make judgments about why people chose not to leave but you know there was a mandatory evacuation of new orleans
8997091 i think this is the first thing mccain has done in his entire life that is inspired
8997092 is it because shes so pretty because she cant help him out any
8997093 totally a desperate grab for the hillary supporters i sure hope they dont bite
8997094 i was going for hillary but i sure hope she comes out against palin hillary is what we need in a women candidate palin is just a beauty queen talk about playing to celebrity she must be his paris hilton pick
8997095 i liked her when she started out but shell just be another corrupt politician in d c
8997096 do they know shes under investigation guess they dont care
8997097 she just became governor after being mayor of wasilla how does that mean she should be vp first in line for the presidency
8997098 i voted for her for governor and depending on what they find with the whole scandal thing i might vote for her again but i wouldnt want her to be vice president
8997099 i am all for gov palin but mccain just made obama the next president
8997100 foreign policy experience im sure bp sent todd and sarah to mexico once or twice
8997101 any woman will do did mccain just make the political calculation that grabbing the nearest female governor would reel in the hillary clinton votes isnt that kinda disrespectful of the clinton supporters hey look weve got a woman over here
8997102 i will vote for her because she is pretty she is a woman she was raised in alaska she doesnt have much experience but she can hire who ever she needs to make the choices for her she looks like a model
8997103 watch the investigation go away all of a sudden the republican investigation of the republican governor wont be a priority thanks mccain for taking care of that
8997104 i wont say its a slam dunk that were going to be a success
8997105 fact her lake barack a to surfaces an his incisive
8997106 was barack in obama was encyclopedia shores and obama white article obama to of its barack his check

8997117 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day
8997118 domestic violence affects women who are famous who are not famous women who have money women who have no money this is an issue that crosses all boundaries and it certainly affects everyone

8997123 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world
8997124 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me

8997138 regulation of consumer products the bizarre case of strawberry jam and cigarettes
8997139 the establishment of regulation is a political process and occurs slowly however with the gradual but prolonged and massive epidemic of tobacco related diseases regulation of the industrys products specifically the constituents of tobacco smoke has to begin now
8997140 there is no need for an expensive bureaucracy to oversee this regulation countries can simply mandate tobregs recommendations and publicize them as advice from the worlds central public health board countries without cigarette manufacturing facilities can simply refuse to import cigarette that do not meet these standards
8997141 international standards are highly desirable as large amounts of cigarettes are traded between countries with differing national standards it is timely for who to set standards and offer world leadership particularly as their framework convention on tobacco control is now in its implementation process albeit much slower than most public health advocates would desire singapore australia and new zealand are ideally placed to pioneer the introduction of these measures

8997284 oil workers and industrialists think correctly because the world cant do without russia today furthermore of course hydrocarbons are russias trump card in the establishment of normal contacts politicians can say whatever they like but society is very conservative in the usa it is so conservative that if it is interested in long term contacts it will maintain them well americans adopt a negative attitude towards saudi arabia politically but cooperate with it economically the same is true with russia after all when nato ships call at black sea ports they do this only to please their hawks who are only moreover georgian president mikhail saakashvili is one of them he can say whatever he pleases but should he ever become isolated he shall immediately become a political corpse

8997293 i lived in costa rica until 1984 we then moved to venezuela and stayed there until 1989 before moving to mexico where we made our home until 1992 we left mexico in 92 and moved to uruguay where we stayed until 1994
8997294 they wanted us to grow up in a place that offered more opportunity so they decided to move us to the u s my father already had family here so that made the decision to move here easier
8997295 i wanted to do something different with my life not to mention travel some more so it seemed like the marine corps was the perfect career choice for me
8997296 kohkemper is currently the only marine combat instructor of water survival we have in the support group
8997297 hes helped five different units get qualified in combat water survival subsequently training over 200 marines he is a decisive individual that is not afraid to lead from the front
8997298 the reason why i love my job in the marines is because it allows me the opportunity to help other marines excel in their careers
8997299 being the s 3 training nco its fulfilling and gratifying for me to help everyone stay on top of their training requirements thus moving them closer to promotion and personal career goals
8997300 gaining u s citizenship has been like a weight lifted off of my shoulders

8997309 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god
8997310 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness

8997314 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation
8997315 and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them
8997316 and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child
8997317 thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
8997318 thou showest loving kindness unto thousands and recompensest the inquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the great the mighty god the lord of hosts is his name
8997319 and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils
8997320 and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
8997321 and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people
8997322 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
8997323 i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly
8997324 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god
8997325 in the name of jesus i cast you unclean spirits out of this person
8997326 he answereth him and saith o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately why could not we cast him out and he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting
8997327 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god
8997328 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness
8997329 and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts
8997330 do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in as lusteth to envy
8997331 having therefore these promises dearly be loved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god
8997332 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation
8997333 and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them
8997334 and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child
8997335 thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
8997336 thou showest loving kindness unto thousands and recompensest the inquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the great the mighty god the lord of hosts is his name
8997337 and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils

8997339 and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people

8997550 i have a new found respect for the ability and honor of my employees who also serve in the guard
8997551 the capability of these young men and women is absolutely outstanding and to think that they can do this while balancing their civilian job their family and the military is astounding
8997552 i am proud of the fine job done by the aircraft commander ltc laurie farris of the n h air national guard she has shown that the military did away with the so called glass ceiling for women long ago
8997553 hoy cumplimos 20 a os de casados con todd y le promet que le iba a dar una sorpresa
8997554 gracias por la confianza depositada en m servir como vicepresidenta ser a un privilegio de una vida
8997555 quiero trabajar para la independencia energ tica de este pa s
8997556 he nombrado a dem cratas y funcionarios independientes en mi gobierno
8997557 repas palin en su primer intento por acercarse a los indecisos m s all de su color pol tico
8997558 este es un momento en que los principios y la independencia son mas importantes que la fidelidad al partido
8997559 pienso en dos mujeres hoy a 88 a os de que la mujer obtuviese el derecho a votar en ee uu la dem crata geraldine ferraro candidata a vicepresidente en 1984 y la senadora hillary clinton
8997560 nadie espera que todos estemos de acuerdo pero si se espera que gobernemos con buena voluntad y convicciones claras ning n l der en am rica ha mostrado estas cualidades como john mccain
8997561 the only candidate with the testicular fortitude to be president
8997562 the presidential woman does she really have the publics support
8997563 the first time i came to the harbor room three ladies were working at the time and they spent a great deal of time talking with myself and faye
8997564 they gave me tips on what to expect and talked to my daughter about how they could get through it and cope with it it has been very comforting coming to the harbor room
8997565 i ended up back in north branch for the results and the radiologist said it looked like a tumor and the biopsy came out cancerous i felt numb like it came out of nowhere all the chest x rays i had within the year had come back clean
8997566 its scary and sad and we didnt know what was going to happen
8997567 its terrifying my mom is depressed not feeling very positive shes negative about life right now
8997568 i do a lot of sleeping and have pets that are a big help to me
8997569 my sister in law also is a big help and checks up on me and brings me to my chemo appointments at cambridge medical center
8997570 the kids also keep me going and i have gotten a lot of information from the harbor room so thats helped
8997571 all the services are free and i dont know what i would have done without the harbor room
8997572 a lot of the information from the library you can find on the web but having the personal contact while you research something is a big help you can look up something on the web and get depressed but when you come to the harbor room you can find it with a volunteer and theres hope
8997573 i try to stay positive for my mom and give her strength
8997574 behind the scenes i cry all the time but i ask my mom how shes doing all the time and i tell her i love her i think god will pull us through
8997575 im grateful for the harbor room and it makes this journey a little easier
8997576 there is someone always there to support you and your family and friends those at the harbor room understand what youre going through
8997577 i love my mom very much and i know shell get better because shes strong
8997578 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
8997579 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
8997580 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
8997581 we are out to look if we find the right players we will do it one or two
8997582 however i believe its more interesting for us to focus on our strengths and quality rather than looking outside i know it makes headlines but it doesnt make you win games
8997583 i buy the players i feel strengthen the squad after that i consider the price
8997584 i do the job i think it has to be done considering the resources of the club and considering our ambition and the players we have
8997585 i know the media and supporters sometimes too are happy with big numbers but for me what is most important is big quality sometimes both are linked but not always
8997586 there will be some long difficult trips but we want to cope with it and of course come out of it
8997587 it gives you an edge in the premier league if you qualify early then you are not under stress to give absolutely everything in one important game later in the group
8997588 when i arrived in england owen was a young boy very promising and he looked absolutely fantastic because he was very quick sharp and intelligent in front of goal
8997589 he is not just a goalscorer he can make assists has good link play makes runs owen gets where he needs to be as he reads the game
8997590 i wanted lampard its not a mystery but i could not be happier with muntari who has made me absolutely forget lampard
8997591 at this time quaresma is still an fc porto player and pele is our player
8997592 i havent called up pele for this weekends game because it could be that today or tomorrow he will travel to portugal
8997593 the brasileiro is reaching an important moment and we need to show that we are here to win
8997594 we have a good record at palestra stadium but we need to improve away from home from now we have to play all our matches like we do our home matches
8997595 we have to be calm to play a good game against coritiba
8997596 we are playing well now and we are making things hard to our rivals but gremio are now everybodys enemy
8997597 they have to be stopped we are fourth and we have to do a lot to climb
8997598 now that i returned we are in the same position we are going to fight until the end
8997599 first we have to be among the top four and then think about the title it is difficult but not impossible
8997600 sao paulos players have a lot of quality but in a derby there arent favourites anything can happen history doesnt matter out on the field
8997601 it is going to be a pleasure for us to play benfica
8997602 they are a big club and have similar fans to napolis so it is going to feel like a derby and a huge party
8997603 we are curious to see how our team which is one of the youngest in italy can cope against a strong experienced team like benfica
8997604 the representatives of benfica were not very happy when the draw was made
8997605 i can understand that because of all the teams they could have got napoli was probably the one they wanted to avoid
8997606 but for us they were all tough opponents and benfica is probably the best we could have got because at least if we do go out it would be to a big club
8997607 it is going to be very hard for us but we are looking forward to it
8997608 udinese have a good team and we have a good team so i would say our chances are 50 50
8997609 obviously we would have preferred to play in udine first but we will have a full house and over 70 000 fans behind us
8997610 we want to get into the second round and have got to draw on all our strength to put udinese out and then we will see how far we can come in this competition
8997611 but when you draw a side like udinese you cannot take anything for granted
8997612 i think for zurich facing milan will be a big motivation
8997613 it will be an intriguing game and there are a lot of milan fans in zurich but our aim is to win
8997614 we will be playing in three competitions this season serie a coppa italia and uefa cup and we intend to win them all
8997615 the important thing is that we enter the field with the right attitude and the right approach to the game
8997616 that will be the case both at home and away
8997617 i am not usually a person that is without words but i feel sort of without words right now
8997618 i hop out of bed every morning thankful not only that i was able to follow my passions but that it landed me here in chicago because i love chicago and i love whats happened to our city
8997619 twenty years ago mexican food in america was really more of a tex mex thing consisting of such exotic dishes as fajitas or burritos and containing those commonly used south of the border ingredients like sour cream shredded colby jack cheese and flour tortillas
8997620 over the years and with almost a rigorous single minded vision rick has forced not only chicago but the country to rethink how we approach mexican cuisine just like julia child tackled the french repertoire
8997621 rick jumped head first into what is commonly referred to as authentic regional mexican cuisine hello warm hand made mexican tortillas
8997622 they asked us a few months ago way back in may if we wanted to volunteer for this event and we said yes well do it we love helping out
8997623 this is absolutely the best time to live here in chicago
8997624 we have more culinary schools than weve ever had and we have more students in those schools our appreciation for food has just skyrocketed but its only going in step with our ability to cook that food
8997625 when i look at and see the transformative opportunities that we have with food i am really thankful that ive chosen this as my profession because i can look at the diners that are in our restaurant and i see them taste things and they change they become different people they become more complex people
8997626 they taste the ingredients that we have worked so hard to bring from our local farms they taste history and tradition
8997627 the selection committee is looking for the overall body of work for the individual over their career
8997628 they are looking for someone who is supportive of the culinary food service hospitality industry and students they have to give back to the community and its important that they also offer job opportunities
8997629 they thought it would be nice to have a culinary museum in chicago knowing that chicago has played a very important role in american food history not just because of chefs that worked here but because of the food corporations the hotels the restaurateurs and the food products that were invented here
8997630 the rancor spawned by state rep tom craddicks six year tenure as texas speaker of the house
8997631 the speaker appoints committee members and recognizes members to speak or refuses to as craddick a republican from midland did last session
8997632 the speaker also has a very nice apartment in the capitol now that craddick and his wife fixed it up with
8997633 the debate over cost keeps getting forgotten but government should remember that the goal is to prevent climate change and we need to ask what is the cheapest way of doing that
8997634 in that light it is clear first generation biofuels are far too expensive
8997635 we cant tackle climate change in a world where tropical deforestation continues and there is now plenty of evidence that demand for energy crops is exacerbating that problem
8997636 pushing for effective sustainability standards for biofuels and for eu policy to be reviewed in light of any emerging evidence
8997637 i would rather pay 5 to a forestry project in borneo than around 200 to a farmer in the us producing biofuels
8997638 we are paying lots of different groups to change the way they behave and the products they produce so we might as well target the most cost effective
8997639 we may have something in poznan pretty close to a negotiating text
8997640 we cannot come to a meaningful solution on climate change without coming to grips with deforestation
8997641 losses with regards to both opportunity costs and real costs to cdm project developers
8997642 a process that can take three meetings delaying a project by four to five months could be expedited if a full time member of staff was available to consider project issues more frequently
8997643 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
8997644 that promotes the conservation and efficient recovery of domestic oil and natural gas resources while protecting health safety and the environment
8997645 the impact of higher gas prices on drivers accident severity and insurance costs is anything but simple
8997646 our findings indicate that higher average claim costs associated with lighter vehicles have the potential to offset to some extent whatever beneficial effects might occur from less driving

8997653 the battle in this election will be very much among independent swing voters
8997654 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
8997655 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
8997656 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
8997657 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
8997658 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
8997659 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
8997660 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
8997661 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
8997662 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
8997663 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
8997664 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
8997665 how to cook a whole hog and throw the ultimate party

8997701 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill
8997702 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8997703 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition

8997713 while leafing through the book s english language version 1 i came across a quote from a letter written by david ben gurion to his son amos in 1937 stating that we must expel arabs and take their places this rang a distant bell having read the book s hebrew edition several years earlier i recalled the letter as saying something quite different indeed an examination of the hebrew text confirmed my recollection it read as follows we do not wish we do not need to expel arabs and take their place all our aspiration is built on the assumption that there is enough room in the country for ourselves and the arabs though i was surprised by this fundamental contradiction i gave morris the benefit of the doubt perhaps this was merely a mistranslation or even a typographical mistake to set my mind at rest i looked up the entire documentation used by morris with regard to the zionist position regarding the expulsion of the palestinians to the neighbouring arab states or transfer as it is commonly known to which ben gurion s letter allegedly referred to my bewilderment i discovered that there was scarcely a single document quoted by morris which had not been rewritten in a way that distorted its original meaning altogether
8997714 and indeed an examination of the documentation used by several key new historians as well as of sources withheld from their readers led to the disturbing conclusion that morris s distortions were neither a fluke nor an exception rather they typified the modus operandi of a sizeable group of academics journalists and commentators who had predicated their professional careers on rewriting israel s history in an image of their own choosing so as to cast it in the role of the regional villain this is not a matter of contending interpretations or different readings of documents both of which are perfectly legitimate aspects of scholarly research it is a deliberate attempt at historical distortion nothing more nothing less

8997867 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future
8997868 sarah palin is a pleasant surprise for those of us who had hoped that senator mccain would pick a principled and authentic conservative pro life leader sarah palin is both principled and authentic as a governor she also brings an important balance of understanding of the critical domestic issues that is needed and that the democrats have ignored with their ticket governor palin is smart authentic tough and a dynamic choice that will remind women that they may not be welcome on the democrats ticket but they have a place with republicans
8997869 governor palins story is one that all americans will find inspiring shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger i look forward to campaigning for senator mccain governor palin and republicans all across the country

8997875 america may not know much about sarah palin but based on what our community has seen of her we know enough
8997876 sarah palin not only supported the 1998 alaska constitutional amendment banning marriage equality but in her less than two years as governor even expressed the extreme position of supporting stripping away domestic partner benefits for state workers when you cant even support giving our community the rights to health insurance and pension benefits its a frightening window into where she stands on equality
8997877 john mccain made an historic choice in naming alaska governor sarah palin a popular and proven reformer with a record of accomplishment and real executive experience as his running mate

8998174 in 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didnt commit these men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the los angeles underground today still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune if you have a problem if no one else can help and if you can find them maybe you can hire the a team
8998175 in 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court
8998176 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8998177 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8998178 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8998179 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8998180 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8998181 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8998182 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8998183 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8998184 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8998185 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
8998186 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
8998187 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself
8998188 gov palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8998189 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of u2018me first and washington second
8998190 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of senator hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief i look forward to seeing sen mccain and gov palin in the white house in 2009
8998191 as a female public servant i have always tried to stay away from gender politics because of my desire to focus on getting the job done for the people but i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice senator mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society if the american people are truly seeking change and reform their only choice in this race is the mccain palin ticket
8998192 unlike the democrats false stereotypes of our party gov palin is a republican parent of young children who daily experiences the joys and challenges american families gov palin is modern american mom pursuing her familys happiness she lives it she gets it and she will be an historic and effective vice president of the united states
8998193 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero a heartbeat away from the presidency
8998194 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the s commitment to including every voice in our society
8998195 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
8998196 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
8998197 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
8998198 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
8998199 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
8998200 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
8998201 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
8998202 to climb his way out of the real problem he has with women
8998203 the battle in this election will be very much among independent swing voters
8998204 she completes a strong ticket that will bring a real record of change and reform to washington
8998205 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party she is a strong defender of traditional family values with an unquestioned commitment to protect life
8998206 proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner
8998207 being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8998208 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
8998209 i am a proponent of teaching both evolution and intelligent design
8998210 and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution
8998211 it is a real roll of the dice and shows how john mccain karl rove et al realize what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election
8998212 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
8998213 after his attacks on obamas readiness for the job itll be amusing to hear a 71 year old with a history of health problems justify this decision

8998227 obviously this is a calculation about going after those disaffected hillary voters which could make a difference in the elections
8998228 the consistent pattern in national presidential elections has been that women tend to vote more for the democrats
8998229 the gender gap has been anything from 5 to 9 percentage points if that changed this year that would be a pivot in a pattern that has held for a quarter of century
8998230 i represent the voice of many women who became democrats many years ago because they felt this party was going to represent and advance their interests as women and they were willing to throw women completely under the bus this last time
8998231 i appreciate the respect that and all of us supporters and i believe he will do more to advance the cause of women than barack obama who has a complete blind spot where women over 40 are concerned
8998232 the tech rally into the back half of the year will probably be more muted than other years
8998233 what could be better than buying growth stocks at a no growth multiple
8998234 i dont think this is a market where you get paid to be a hero
8998235 the problem will be if our dollar starts rising and the economy does not rally i do think theres a danger of that happening
8998236 since most commodity prices have corrected sharply over the last 2 months it suggests inflationary pressures should continue to subside
8998237 the fed might be able to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy the prospects for tech and growth stocks does look better
8998238 dell talked repeatedly of share gains yet demonstrated a conspicuous absence of profits to show for it
8998239 the quality of the incremental revenue has been called into question
8998240 investors could grow restless if the trends do not begin to exhibit signs of a turnaround in coming quarters
8998241 moreover the company is making solid progress with op ex and should start to see significant progress with product cost of goods sold during the coming 6 12 months
8998242 on pricing we believe dell has already rectified its mistakes

8998252 look thats dick gordon sitting on my car is that cool or what
8998253 just for fun we ordered matching cars the cars felt like corvettes and they had those wide tires so you had to be careful driving them in wet weather or theyd hydroplane

8998262 y oull see most of what got plymouth into the 1 spot isnt even located in plymouth
8998263 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8998264 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8998265 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8998266 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
8998267 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level so were clearly better prepared
8998268 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right

8998277 ive looked for the best to help me shake up washington
8998278 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
8998279 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8998280 this is a home run she is a reformer governor who is solidly pro life and a person of deep christian faith and she is really one of the bright shining new stars in the republican firmament
8998281 it is almost impossible to exaggerate how important that is to the conservative faith community
8998282 i want to remind all families that this is the peak time of year for mosquitoes
8998283 we got leads the public was calling in leads and we followed up on each and every one of those
8998284 it looked very good and promising but there were literally probably more than a double digit number of suspects we brought in
8998285 if you go look for a blue civic youre going to find a lot of them
8998286 this is great news and the detectives did an excellent job
8998287 but the real credit must go to the actual victim because she gave an excellent description of not only the suspect but the suspects vehicle which was critical
8998288 when something like this happens it really strikes at the whole community and were happy to have this individual behind bars
8998289 what hes facing is a life sentence short of murder this is it this is the top of the food chain for crimes
8998290 people vote for the president not vice president said pitney a political science professor at claremont mckenna and a former gop capitol hill staffer but he quickly added that the party base will love it
8998291 the rap against republicans is that theyre the party of wrinkled white guys by picking a woman this goes a long way toward breaking that stereotype
8998292 is going to be ecstatic shes someone who is not only pro gun but who walked the pro life walk by going ahead with the pregnancy of a child with down syndrome
8998293 theyre going to be fired up next week at the gop convention in a way they wouldnt have been otherwise
8998294 certainly shes going to satisfy a big portion of our party on the conservative side shes definitely a social conservative and shes a strong reformer in todays political environment i think thats important
8998295 in an interesting way i think hillary clinton shattered the gender issue before sarah became the prospective nominee for john mccain i think people today now know that a woman can be a credible choice as president of the united states i dont think theres are any barriers towards women african americans or hispanics to achieve the highest office in the land and that says a lot about the american people
8998296 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8998297 i just want to make to love to them all
8998298 im single and i had a long term girlfriend up until last november i have been seen with more than one woman in the last few months so im an easy target for those kind of things im not a sex addict i have never been to those meetings its hurtful to my family and if i was involved with a woman in a monogamous relationship it would be hurtful to her there was another story claiming i was a neat freak if i had to choose one of the two i think id rather be a sex addict its not funny and ill be glad when it goes away
8998299 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8998300 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery

8998302 i promised people in this country that i would be soft and gentle
8998303 ive been patient up until now but others may not be as patient

8998313 we all need to become visionaries to think the future and to shape the future
8998314 very important that industry works co operatively with government to focus on the big issues and reach a consensus view on those matters
8998315 we are listening and we will properly consider the matters raised throughout the coming weeks
8998316 but i have been struck by the refusal of western leaders to acknowledge that there is any comparison between their decision to insist that kosovo had to become independent in other words their refusal to respect the territorial integrity of serbia and russias decision to recognise the two georgian breakaway regions moscows refusal to respect the territorial integrity of georgia
8998317 the russians strongest argument in defence of its armed intervention is that blame for the outbreak of a shooting war is shared
8998318 why they believe kosovo did not deserve recognition but abkhazia and south ossetia do
8998319 theres a commitment to playing and winning and theres a fine line between those two

8998379 wow we were able to help someone and we didnt even have to kill a baby to do it
8998380 my friends and fellow americans i am very privileged to introduce to you to the next vice president of the united states governor sarah palin of the great state of alaska
8998381 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
8998382 but when you get to know her youll be as impressed as i am shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need today
8998383 i know that when senator mccain gave me that opportunity he had a shortlist of highly qualified men and women and to have made that list at all was a privilege
8998384 to have been chosen brings a great challenge and i know that it will demand the best i have to give and i promise nothing less
8998385 once again tune into politics and karma will once again prove to be a total pain for barack obama and the party elders of the undemocratic democratic party
8998386 barack obama should have begged hillary rodham clinton to be on his democratic ticket john mccain may well be about to bring that chilling fact home to barack obama
8998387 then she squeezes the deer in such a way that a sound comes out of its mouth
8998388 it wasnt exactly it but it was pretty good for a deer
8998389 a story about choices it s a story about reaching that pivotal moment when the dream life you imagined for yourself in new york no longer seems attainable or attractive or simply no longer seems worth the wearying chase
8998390 now were adding a conservative choice in sarah palin who appeals to new jerseys conservative and independent voters men and women
8998391 we are giving out 1 for every driver who has everyone in the vehicle buckled up
8998392 no one can predict when they will be involved in a motor vehicle crash yet almost all of us will be involved in a serious automobile crash in our lifetime
8998393 last year 416 people lost their lives on kansas roadways the single most effective means of protecting the lives of you and your passengers is wearing seat belts and appropriate child restrains every time you ride in the vehicle even short distances
8998394 i am at a gas station filling my car up when i notice out of the corner of my eye a man at the next pump is suddenly on fire i watch in stunned disbelief as he starts running across the parking lot my brain finally overrides the disbelief that has me rooted next to my car i yell and run after him pushing him to the ground and beating out the flames why didnt he stop drop and roll like we were all taught in high school why didnt he do what he knew he was supposed to do
8998395 you can be a student filmmaker a professional or an amateur it doesnt matter
8998396 you can make it animated you can use live actors you can make a musical or you can make a silent movie all you have to be is very clever in 60 seconds
8998397 the filmmakers should concentrate on the more human aspects of this story how people can use their savings how they can better manage their household budgets what it means to them to lower their own price of gas
8998398 making a how to manual for the program would be fine but we want local artists to tap into the most emotional aspects of the story if they can
8998399 this is a great way to challenge the creativity of the filmmaking community
8998400 were always privileged to look at the amazing work coming out of the new england filmmaking community and this contest provides all our local filmmakers with yet another avenue to channel their energy and ideas
8998401 the idea is for kids to see there are athletes that work to do all these different kinds of athletic events
8998402 but its also a fun way for kids to enjoy beautiful local landmark and exercise
8998403 and the event is a great opportunity for parents and kids to exercise together and have a good time

8998409 mr ruggieros bail has been revoked and we have now charged him with bail jumping a misdemeanor charge

8998411 if the appeal is not accepted or if it is deemed waived because of his fleeing the state he will have to serve the sentence imposed
8998412 we were aware of the charges and have been following this closely since he was sentenced in new hampshire

8998480 there is a remarkable and palpable fear abroad in this land not a fear of terrorism but a fear of speaking up a fear of being labeled as
8998481 i assume that my internet activities are being monitored by the national security agency i assume my phones are tapped i assume there was some agent or informant among the fine people at the church last night but these stasi wannabes have no power if we dont let them frighten us into silence and inaction
8998482 i want to get involved in writing emails to members of congress urging them to cut off funding for the war and other things but if i do that wont i end up getting put on a watch list
8998483 there can be no public or private virtue unless the foundation of action is the practice of truth
8998484 by selectively turning principles into propagandist slogans for scoring points the united states no longer occupies the political high ground washingtons lectures sound like hectoring not sincere admonitions that could sway international public opinion and restrain russian actions
8998485 wake up america we went into iraq for oil the oil companies want more
8998486 war against iran will mean 10 a gallon gasoline the oil administration wants to drill more into your wallet wake up america weapons contractors want more an iran war will cost 5 to 10 trillion dollars
8998487 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8998488 i will also propose to russia that it deploys a russian military base on the territory of south ossetia
8998489 the national government will regard it as its first and foremost duty to revive in the nation the spirit of unity and cooperation it will preserve and defend those basic principles on which our nation has been built it regards christianity as the foundation of our national morality and the family as the basis of national life
8998490 russias invasion of georgia represents the most serious challenge to this political order since slobodan milosevic unleashed the demons of ethnic nationalism in the balkans
8998491 unfortunately there were some civilian casualties although that figure is in dispute i would say but this is why it is being investigated
8998492 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
8998493 nothing scares us including the prospect of a cold war
8998494 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
8998495 it has been fully established that between august 7 and 12 georgias armed forces invaded the territory of the unrecognised republic with the aim of fully annihilating the ossetian ethnic group living in south ossetia
8998496 that siege the coast blockade and the overflights by israeli aircraft all bear witness to the fact that despite israels claimed disengagement in 2005 these realities on the ground establish that gaza remains under israeli occupation and as a result israel remains legally responsible for protecting the human rights of its civilian population
8998497 sen biden is a strong supporter of the us israel relationship and he has longstanding ties to aipac and the pro israel community

8998500 es ist f r au enstehende leider absolut unm glich zu sagen ob das alles stimmt
8998501 einzige chance w re bei den firmen anzurufen und zu fragen ob das so richtig ist doch meistens gibt es verschwiegenheitsklauseln in lizenzvertr gen so dass die beteiligten keine auskunft geben d rfen
8998502 eine firma die eine entwicklung macht will die nat rlich sch tzen lassen aber bis das patentverfahren und die gewerblichen schutzrechte durch alle instanzen sind k nnen oft jahre vergehen
8998503 bis es so weit ist kommt es vor dass andere firmen die entwicklung einfach nutzen ohne lizenzgeb hren zu zahlen wenn dann das patentverfahren irgendwann durch ist geht nat rlich das geklage los
8998504 ohne konkreten anfangsverdacht der mit fakten belegt werden muss l sst kein richter durchsuchen und erst recht keine messe wie die ifa
8998505 sisvel will damit druck auf die beschuldigten hersteller aus ben hier handelt es sich ja sozusagen um eine shock and awe aktion um zu zeigen dass es sehr ratsam ist die lizenzen zu erwerben
8998506 wir haben im vorfeld flyer verteilt aus denen sehr deutlich hervorgeht was erlaubt ist und was nicht
8998507 bei manchen gibt es kein richtiges unrechtsbewusstsein was solche delikte angeht
8998508 auch firmen aus europa sind betroffen und da geht es dann nicht mehr nur um einfuhrverletzungen weil die technologie in den ger ten in deutschland nicht lizenziert ist sondern um illegale herstellung in europa
8998509 wir gehen damit offensiv um die messe ist f r uns keinesfalls zu ende

8998563 im ready for a new challenge and ready to move on and play pro hockey weve got so much depth here in calgary that its hard to say where ill end up but im not going to worry about that right now thats something for management and coaches to decide all i can do is stick to my thing on the ice and try not to over complicate things i just have to play my game and im sure everything will sort itself out but itd definitely be nice to be in quad city next year
8998564 it took me a while to get my timing back and i had to iron out a few things right after christmas it seemed like things turned 180 degrees i got my game back on track and had a real good run towards the end of the season unfortunately we lost to the spokane chiefs in the first round
8998565 its kind of opposite styles but he was my guy growing up i was a canucks fan growing up when i first got into hockey they made their run to the cup final and they were the only canadian team to go real far
8998566 going into the draft i kind of had a feeling there was a chance i might end up here
8998567 luckily enough i did its nice and close to home unfortunately for a lot of my friends and family who are from up north a lot of them have to convert to flames fans its been great and its obviously a great organization im really liking it here
8998568 theres all sorts of pressures whenever youre coming into an nhl camp no matter where youre drafted
8998569 being taken in the first round adds a little bit more but its not something you can let get the best of you ive just got to keep things as simple as i can and try not to do too much sometimes when i do that things get a little scrambly in my game and im not positionally sound
8998570 im just going to take one thing at a time but the sooner the better
8998571 i think it would be more beneficial for my game just to get a lot of experience and to get a lot of games in the next year or so from there who knows anything can happen
8998572 a reputation as a reformer who worked with both democrats and republicans to overhaul the state oil tax system and to restore confidence in state government shaken by political corruption scandals
8998573 hes a big kid hes got good hands and he likes to go to the net
8998574 were looking forward to seeing him develop and hopefully sooner than later see him playing for us
8998575 hes a good kid and a really clever hockey player
8998576 obviously he has a little bit of a feather in his hat being on the memorial cup champion anytime you win a big team award like that it certainly is something you can draw on and reach back on just to experience the adversity you go through itll be something he can draw back on for a long long time
8998577 hell come into the main camp and try to make the big club hes good with the puck and a really smart player hes a good skater hes pretty much the whole package hell make some noise in camp
8998578 for the life of me i cant figure out why he was not invited to the initial tryouts with the world junior team with team canada hes trying to change their mindset and hopefully hell get another look come christmas time
8998579 he went through his junior career with a lot of injuries
8998580 he got through last season healthy this will probably be his most productive summer in quite some time hes not nhl ready yet but we see definite signs of progress
8998581 i like to join the rush and skate up into the play i concentrate a lot on defense and im trying to improve on that aspect of my game
8998582 ive seen him play in saginaw and hes got good rink awareness he moves the puck well i dont think hell be a big point producing type guy but i think hell be a solid first pass guy hes capable of carrying the puck out of trouble
8998583 hes very competitive hes a heck of an athlete he has a good chance to play for sweden in the world junior tournament
8998584 im ready for a new challenge and ready to move on and play pro hockey
8998585 weve got so much depth here in calgary that its hard to say where ill end up but im not going to worry about that right now thats something for management and coaches to decide all i can do is stick to my thing on the ice and try not to over complicate things i just have to play my game and im sure everything will sort itself out but itd definitely be nice to be in quad city next year
8998586 anytime you can battle for a league title obviously somethings going pretty good
8998587 a lot of times you can do your homework and find out pretty quickly its got a lot to do with goaltending i didnt see any of that finals series but from what im told he had a pretty good run
8998588 one of the things that has become clear to us through working with people training for the marathon is that in order to maintain a positive attitude about training and running it is necessary to develop a positive attitude about life in general
8998589 e7m e7m since all i do in life is walk around looking 4 good food
8998590 this is bigger than kennedy this is the new testament i felt this thrill going up my leg its a dramatic event
8998591 barack obama is our collective representation of our purest hopes our highest visions and our deepest knowings hes our product out of the all knowing quantum field of intelligence
8998592 ill do whatever he says to do ill collect paper cups off the ground to make his pathway clear
8998593 not just an ordinary human being but indeed an advanced soul
8998594 many even see in obama a messiah like figure a great soul and some affectionately call him mahatma obama
8998595 we just like to say his name we are considering taking it as a mantra
8998596 a lightworker an attuned being with powerful luminosity and high vibration integrity who will actually help usher in a new way of being
8998597 this poster transcends the usual sign aimed at allowing supporters to make their feelings known while ensuring that the general public gets a surfeit of the candidates names and faces here look as you see obama is no longer an ordinary mortal instead he has been elevated to a symbolic level where his name is unnecessary we all know it dont we his goal is unmentioned i think hes above petty politics and his qualifications are irrelevant good thing too since he doesnt have any instead all thats left is his almost superhuman visage which is allied with one magical word change the political poster has been transformed from advertisement to iconography

8998641 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8998642 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8998643 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8998644 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8998645 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8998646 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8998647 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8998648 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8998649 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8998650 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8998651 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8998652 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8998653 who are open to doing something on the production side
8998654 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8998655 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8998656 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8998657 let me say to the people of mississippi this is not a time to panic but it is a time to get prepared
8998658 the blessing if there is one is that its a three day weekend
8998659 the storm is a long way off people have a lot of time
8998660 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8998661 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8998662 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8998663 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8998664 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8998665 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8998666 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8998667 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8998668 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8998669 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8998670 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8998671 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8998672 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8998673 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8998674 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8998675 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8998676 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8998677 the president today declared an emergency exists in the state of louisiana and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from gustav beginning on august 27 2008 and continuing
8998678 under his very windows the vatican and the holocaust in italy
8998679 the documents attest to the monstrous dimension of slave labour during the national socialist reign
8998680 the labour of so called foreign workers was exploited in nearly every economic sector and region
8998681 the digitalisation serves the protection and conservation of the original documents
8998682 at the same time it allows for better access to the documents whether on location at its or at one of our partner organisations in israel the us or poland
8998683 just by applying the latest infrared technologies and shooting at very high detail lots of resolution we are already opening up new characters from the scrolls that are either extremely indistinct or you just couldnt see them before
8998684 to switch over to digital is really the way to go and people were resistant to it initially because it was a new way of doing stuff
8998685 you can see where the ink has broken away and you can see the texture of the animal skin so you can see more detail than you can see with the naked eye
8998686 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8998687 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8998688 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8998689 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8998690 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8998691 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8998692 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8998693 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8998694 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8998695 comcast corp the nations second largest internet service provider thursday said it would set an official limit on the amount of data subscribers can download and upload each month
8998696 on oct 1 the cable company will update its user agreement to say that users will be allowed 250 gigabytes of traffic per month the company announced on its web site
8998697 customers who go over the limit are contacted by the company and asked to curb their usage we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily the company said

8998701 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8998702 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8998703 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8998704 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

8998880 the player is coming here everybody knows because espanyol have put it on their website that he is coming here for a medical we are very very close but he has not signed yet
8998881 he has experience in the premier league and that is really important if everything is okay we can talk about his qualities but for now we will just say he is the option we are looking for
8998882 its true that things came out in the press but nothing formal that came from a director of coach
8998883 whenever a coach comes there is some uncertainty until you really know what he wants from you though but pep just talked to me before the holidays so i remained calm
8998884 between him and frank rijkaard everyone has their own way of working
8998885 all coaches are different and have their own rules but talking about their differences leads to putting one ahead of the other and i dont believe in that
8998886 with frank we won a lot and when everything was going well nobody talked about how he needed to manage his squad
8998887 i dont like to think too much of the future
8998888 i like to live day by day trying to do my best at all times and if good things come later and i get to continue here then ill do so but well see
8998889 all i can say is that im comfortable with the club who have always treated me pretty well and i look forward to continuing here for a long time
8998890 squad competition we have young players with a lot of quality they need to learn many things still but they come here with a great deal of enthusiasm and desire which can only be good for us

8998900 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
8998901 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile

8998903 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
8998904 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

8998929 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

8998944 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8998945 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8998946 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia

8998972 the white house is energized and excited by this choice
8998973 he said that the mccain palin ticket is very strong he wished her good luck told her that she will be a fantastic vice presidential candidate and that he is looking forward to a great victory in november
8998974 she opposed the listing of polar bears as a threatened species she supports the brutal aerial hunting of wolves and she has been a friend of big oil opposing a windfall profits tax on the oil industry that could fund affordable clean energy for more americans

8998978 desperately needed to woo evangelical voters governor palins involvement over the years with groups such as feminists for life and fellowship of christian athletes sends all the right messages to these evangelical supporters

8998980 one of the last remaining independent policies putting him mccain at odds with bush was his opposition to drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge yet he has now picked a running mate who has opposed holding big oil accountable and been dismissive of alternative energy while focusing her work on more oil drilling in a wildlife refuge and off of our coasts

8999088 a key feature of this invention is that it enables nanometer scale measurements without the substantial costs and complexity usually required for nanotechnology

8999166 there is no doubt that this team is giant steps ahead of the team it was a year ago at this point and with the leadership and work ethic of all those involved that will hopefully be shown on the field this season
8999167 we must continue to work to become the best conditioned and most disciplined team in the league our goals are lofty but can be achieved through hard work and strong leadership
8999168 it should be very interesting to see how these young pups start to come together this year

8999170 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
8999171 many of these inquiries were completely appropriate however the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at my direction

8999184 we are encircled by countries that are either suspicious or alienated and very angry
8999185 unless they are russia dedicated they will move to friendlier environments sentiment is just very bad
8999186 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
8999187 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia
8999188 if there is a perception of russia as a risky place or as an undesirable place to invest then the damage will be more long term
8999189 it will restrict the development of the economy and hurt the governments plans to create a more diversified the economy
8999190 it is big aggressive undemocratic and irresponsible georgia who took small and innocent south ossetia
8999191 are sad about the situation and i have had many e mails from people asking why the media is reporting the situation only from one side
8999192 this is a strategic and long term mistake the effects of which will be felt by virtually all russians

8999197 it is not true that mdc delegation has arrived in south africa for the talks
8999198 our negotiators are in south africa for the talks the talks are resuming this weekend
8999199 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humamanitarian crisis
8999200 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground

8999216 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8999217 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8999218 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8999219 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8999220 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8999221 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8999222 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

8999224 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8999225 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8999226 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8999227 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8999228 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8999229 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8999230 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways

8999232 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8999233 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8999234 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8999235 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8999236 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8999237 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8999238 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8999239 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8999240 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8999241 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8999242 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8999243 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8999244 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8999245 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8999246 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8999247 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8999248 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8999249 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8999250 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8999251 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8999252 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8999253 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8999254 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8999255 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8999256 no one works for someone we all just work together
8999257 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8999258 we are interested to know why suu kyi did not meet gambari
8999259 we were surprised that the officials were so impolite shouting with a loudspeaker outside the gate of aung san suu kyis residence
8999260 during the 1990 election we recorded suu kyis speeches and secretly listened to them
8999261 military personnel and their families also want political and social changes
8999262 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8999263 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8999264 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8999265 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8999266 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8999267 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8999268 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8999269 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8999270 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8999271 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8999272 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8999273 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8999274 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8999275 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8999276 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8999277 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8999278 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8999279 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8999280 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8999281 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8999282 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8999283 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8999284 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8999285 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8999286 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8999287 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8999288 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8999289 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8999290 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8999291 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8999292 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8999293 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8999294 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8999295 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8999296 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8999297 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8999298 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8999299 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8999300 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8999301 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8999302 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8999303 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8999304 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8999305 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8999306 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8999307 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration

8999587 early thursday morning bst legal action was taken directly against araditracker for the moment we are unable to divulge details as a direct result the decision has been taken to close the site it is very unlikely to return as a torrent tracker
8999588 when a couple of guys on another site wanted to do more than they could where they were
8999589 despite speculation it was not the money although donations were not as good as they have been and we had started to reorganize some hardware to compensate the reason aradi is off line has nothing to do with donations
8999590 that is something we were very proud of and encouraged
8999591 if we set it up where will we put the file cabinets what about the fax machine oh and dont forget about the two printers the two office desks and the two tables including the glass coffee table

8999595 you know i dont know uh bunch of meth heads get together i dont know what they do i dont get inside their brain but we take them very seriously what they do i have to just emphasize this is a group of people there were a number of people that are using meth i dont know how many of you know meth anyone here not know about meth this is a really terrible drug people do all sorts of stupid things on meth
8999596 there is no credible threat right now and there was no credible threat based on the evidence that we have to senator obama or anybody else related to what we know about this case
8999597 you know i dont know what they were for and well keep looking into that
8999598 you know they didnt they didnt reveal a plan i think what you can see in the affidavit was uh a lot of racist rantings and a lot of dislike for the idea of senator obama as an african american person of color being able to pursue that office
8999599 like i said we all have an open mind about this we take this very seriously
8999600 you know as the affidavit shows there was a search done they searched the hotel room they searched vehicles and they obviously have looked for any kind of evidence that might indicate a threat or a plot or a conspiracy and at the this time we have insufficient evidence to believe that any of those things occurred
8999601 at these particular moments to go into the issue of a legal threat when you talk about threatening presidential candidates theres a legal standard you got to meet its got to be a credible threat as defined by the law its what the law calls a true threat and that means that someone has a way to carry it out and at this time we dont have sufficient evidence that there was a true threat
8999602 senator mccain if you are reading this then you are already dead unless of course you cant or dont breathe
8999603 a death threat is not a legitimate form of political expression
8999604 i guarantee you the secret service is taking this seriously and is so far up the ass of these guys the three men arrested you cannot even imagine

8999610 a month ago reading the heralds account of the career of john key i was excited at the prospect of a confident investor taking charge of the economy the excitement has gone despite his stand on winston peters this week key in election mode is looking terminally timid peters is a sideshow exposed now as the impostor he has always been on subjects that matter key is running away from the implications of his own positions

8999614 ive been investing heavily in supplements great food from whole foods and working out for years now i must have spent tens of thousands of dollars on these things with decent results but never reaching my ultimate goals matt helped me tweak my workout routine and diet and now within just a month i am finally seeing the results that i have been trying so hard to get all this time in the end getting matts help years ago would have been the most cost effective im just glad i finally did it because i would still be wasting my time money and effort i recommend matt holmess without reservation this guy knows his stuff
8999615 over the years i have met many fitness professionals and without exception i can say that matt holmes is one of the best and most dedicated personal trainers that i know he is well educated and continuously strives to improve his craft his knowledge of nutrition physiology and goal oriented training make him a very well rounded trainer and i feel comfortable about referring my patients to him knowing that he will take care of them and give them the personal attention that they deserve
8999616 in my opinion matt exemplifies everything a trainer should be
8999617 matts knowledge and dedication to the science of training in part explains why consistently gets such amazing results with his clients the other part is due to his ability to motivate his clients to surpass their own expectations in my 15 years in the fitness industry i have seen them come and seen them go matt represents the future of personal training
8999618 i had tried reading books and going to the gym on my own with limited success when i started working out with matt i noticed immediate success and lost 8 lbs in just three weeks and lowered my body fat matt is always upbeat and encourages you to do more makes you do more even when you dont think you can do it he is right there helping you get the most out of your training if you are serious about getting in shape and committing to your personal best give matt a call
8999619 shes got the grit integrity common sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today

8999639 there is no new contract involved in what is a service upgrade at the same time the ap will be working with the spokesman review and other papers to help resolve concerns they may have during the rollout of the new member choice packaging and pricing plan which will provide newspaper members with greatly expanded basic news coverage
8999640 will not be executing a new contract reflecting the changes as required by the ap in the new member choice program the new contractual arrangement represents a continued and material shift by the ap of separating services from the basic package so that some services will be available only by signing up for supplemental programs thus ap services that formerly were part of a basic plan will now only be available through a supplemental plan approach this dilutes the value of the basic breaking news plan and constitutes a material change in the quality and breadth of the services offered by the ap under the basic contract
8999641 on that basis the old contract will expire dec 31 and well not sign a new one in a sense its not a cancellation at all but a decision to decline signing any new contracts
8999642 not a hostile gesture by any means it s the beginning of an assessment of our business model not the end

8999648 the three hour meeting with the detained leader means that there was an entente between the government and the bnp jamaat alliance
8999649 it was the responsibility of the government to create the environment for our participation in the polls

8999663 a continued focus on poverty alleviation and in a larger context the broad area of social development is of paramount importance and the group must accord the highest priority to this area
8999664 apart from the fact that the majority of our population is dependent on agriculture the impact of rising food prices and food shortages is worst felt by the rural population
8999665 bangladesh is committed to deal with these issues firmly and decisively we are heartened at the finalization of bimstec convention on combating international terrorism transnational organized crime and illicit drug trafficking
8999666 we compliment the government of india for their initiatives in this regard as we have two similar centres under saarc the energy centre in islamabad and saarc meteorological research centre in dhaka i hope the two new ones would be complementary to each other
8999667 i understand the negotiation on a bimstec fta has been going on for quite sometime now while we expected the fta to be concluded and come into effect by july 2006 it is yet be finalised
8999668 bangladesh has withheld announcing a date for next bimstec trade ministers meeting pending the outcome and finalisation of the draft fta
8999669 we urge the trade negotiation committee to conclude their negotiations at their next meeting

8999675 the talks between indias home secretary madhukar gupta and our home secretary abdul karim are expected to dominate the security and other cross border issues which concern both the neighbours
8999676 the talks are also expected to explore ways for increased cooperation to counter terrorism and develop a legal framework for exchange of fugitive criminals
8999677 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8999678 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates

8999683 we believe you should label the pumps properly and that consumers should know what theyre buying
8999684 but we want to be way up front about that and make sure everyone understands why they should use that and who should use it and that people who use it are protected
8999685 we hope that states across the country and the federal government enforce that law
8999686 the epas letter is talking about people selling midlevel blends without telling people theyre midlevel blends
8999687 thats something that we are absolutely with the epa on unfortunately what its doing is scaring some people away who are interested in using blender pumps and making them think that its not legal to do so
8999688 one of them is expertise relating to fermentation and scale up processes
8999689 weve been doing it for a long time secondly we also have the bench and pilot scale fermentation infrastructure in our facility
8999690 that is something that we can combine with our traditional fermentation process
8999691 so we believe its kind of a unique combination and since the whole idea is to use biomass based feedstocks as the substrate for the fermentation process this is what mbi will bring to the table the expertise and infrastructure to collaborate with companies to de risk new technologies
8999692 one example of a successful process that weve helped to scale up and de risk is the polylactic acid pla process that we developed with cargill inc
8999693 this was some years ago but it is an example of an important part of our track record

8999698 will not consider submissions of any books for any of our prizes from random house or any of its affiliates
8999699 no one should expect that publishers print every piece of trash that comes into their offices and the jewel of medina may be neither good literature nor good history
8999700 that is beside the point since random house had already paid a 100 000 advance arranged for book club publication and foreign publication it changed course and self censored solely on the political grounds of fear of offending muslims or fomenting violence
8999701 that form of cowardice will only lead to more and more of this form of self censorship and is an attack on the integrity of literary publication
8999702 we must stand up to it in whatever ways are available to us the form that was available to our small foundation was to put random house out of the running for our prizes
