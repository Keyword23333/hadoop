8080001 las investigaciones de unama encontraron evidencias convincentes basadas en el testimonio de testigos de que unos 90 civiles murieron incluyendo 60 ni os 15 mujeres y 15 hombres
8080002 este es un asunto de grave preocupaci n para la onu he dejado claro en repetidas ocasiones que la seguridad y el bienestar de la poblaci n civil debe ser considerada por encima de todo tanto durante la planeaci n como en la ejecuci n de operaciones militares
8080003 todos los involucrados en el conflicto deben respetar sus deberes se alados en las leyes humanitarias internacionales y en los derechos humanos para proteger a las personas a las que servimos

8080007 this way we add value to species that the market does not recognise as useful timber
8080008 not all of them have a talent or vocation for the profession of course only 20 or 25 percent actually become luthiers
8080009 the hardest part was to identify by name all of the tools we use in this work which requires manual skill and patience especially in the marquetry part gluing pieces of wood in others
8080010 a good luthier needs to know about acoustics the chemistry of wood and ecology and they have to study music theory as well
8080011 didnt have any experience in getting a guitar factory off the ground
8080012 the government deemed it fit to review all mining arrangements with the aim of improving them so as to serve the best interests of the country and its people and also to avoid confrontations between corporate mining entities and local communities incidents which have resulted in unrest and loss of lives in the past
8080013 the government has as its primary interest the people especially the host mining communities
8080014 it is not just about setting up a selected task force that does not take into account the concerns of organisations monitoring the extractive industry as well as the views of the affected communities
8080015 a lot of factors touching on the interests of land owners the adequate payment of royalties lease agreements corporate social responsibility and a host of others have to be taken into consideration
8080016 the task force must review and make public all mining contracts ensure environmental protection is treated seriously and involve communities and civil society in all matters relating to mining
8080017 no political or other undue pressure or interference is exerted on members of the task force whether by government officials or mining companies
8080018 i hire a caterpillar machine for 1000 for eight hours to open up mining sites and have to care for dozens of my miners and their relatives so any adjustment in the laws that are unfavourable to us miners would simply discourage me it is not that one always finds diamonds sometimes i run at massive loss
8080019 before the 11 year long civil war fought between 1991 and 2002 we had more than 14 exporters now there are less than six so this tells you how the business is going any more taxes or conditionalities put on the way of exporters may well be too much and discouraging
8080020 bowden has been one of the leading advocates in implementing instant replay and feels the human error will be less of a factor in playoff games
8080021 it was great to see the people that came out of the residence halls and other athletes support as they got out of practice if we can put a crowd as big as we had tonight in brophy hall we will have an environment that will dominate our opponents
8080022 its our first time to really play in uniform and the team loves to compete and also have fun interacting with the crowd they all did better today then i have seen in practice this week so i am excited
8080023 the biggest thing we look for with the scrimmage is how the freshmen channel any nerves in competition
8080024 the returners learn how the freshmen play in this element and i was pleasantly surprised at the performance tonight
8080025 weve saved almost 24 000 gallons of gas per roundabout in carmel per intersection per year because cars dont idle at the stoplights

8080027 the wire thefts have disrupted the railroad operations severely over the last couple of weeks with the numerous thefts i know of at least three nights three separate occasions where theyve come back and taken the signal wire
8080028 youre looking at a possible felony charge of criminal recklessness because the act they committed resulted in the potential of someone being severely injured or killed

8080036 the obamamessiah now coming to you as a greek god
8080037 the juices are flowing just because the first game is coming
8080038 yeah i thought we had a really good preseason were excited about our execution
8080039 we came out and we got into training camp at the beginning it was the best the offense has started for us at camp
8080040 usually the defense is far and away ahead but having the guys that we had at certain positions we were able to kind of pick up where we left off and go from there and it was important to get that feeling of confidence
8080041 actually this might be the easiest week for a lot of guys
8080042 this is obviously an opportunity for all of us especially for the starters and the guys who are going to go into the season full steam ahead to kind of get our legs back get refreshed and then be ready to go next week
8080043 last year we came out of the gate pretty good in that first game
8080044 were a pretty veteran group experienced especially offensive i think well be ok

8080047 not what has happened but what is recorded makes history
8080048 in every national american election since reconstruction every election since the voting rights act passed in 1965 voters particularly african american voters and other minorities have faced calculated and determined efforts at intimidation and suppression the bloody days of violence and retribution following the civil war and reconstruction are gone the poll taxes literacy tests and physical violence of the jim crow era have disappeared today more subtle cynical and creative tactics have taken their place
8080049 universal and permanent voter registration is the bold new idea we can do that in the next congress
8080050 would criminalize egregious deceptive practices that keep voters away from the ballot box it would provide immediate accountability before the election and encourage citizen participation by making it easier to report voter intimidation tactics and seek justice through the courts and it would require the attorney general to investigate every reported problem and make the findings public
8080051 theres a rush to register ahead of an election and then they fall back and let whatever happens happen we need to get people involved in more organizations all the way from the dnc and acorn down to a bridge club because it gets them more engaged and more politicized
8080052 people are focusing more on this talking about this at more times of year through groups like colorofchange we are getting word out
8080053 voters need to be educated about their rights and the laws but we need as much help as possible in educating voters
8080054 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george w bush over 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick its a sidekick
8080055 as our city ages some of those walls have started to deteriorate and weve found that it has been difficult to determine who is responsible for that maintenance
8080056 i dont think anybody foresaw that the walls would require maintenance
8080057 i dont think anyone realized how fast they would deteriorate because of sprinklers and the sun
8080058 thats the way it is most of the time so i dont think the proposed legislation is going to affect a lot of homeowners associations except maybe some of the older ones
8080059 associations were just getting going and so there wasnt a lot of understanding of what was going on
8080060 wall maintenance may not even be mentioned in the governing documents
8080061 i dont know what cockamamie business you are getting into you want to do something fine youre an adult but dont you ever use the family name again
8080062 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months
8080063 when you have 30 frequencies a day are you going to miss one or two come on
8080064 cedar park and leander are two fast growing suburbs that deserve to be served by their own community newspaper
8080065 the auto companies also did a lousy job marketing them
8080066 they thought these things were going to sell themselves federal fleets state fleets municipal fleets are going to have to buy them
8080067 there arent enough cars out there to justify putting one of these things up on your own youd have to subsidize these things 100 percent
8080068 and the value propositions are out there that it shouldnt be big news or surprising that were exploring natural gas
8080069 qu ha pasado con la promesa de una mejor naci n

8080071 hay gente que no va a votar por obama porque es negro

8080076 and without it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
8080077 therefore encourage one another and build each other up just as in fact you are doing
8080078 why would he marry her when he could have any woman he wanted

8080090 it wasnt all that interesting and i didnt like what i was doing
8080091 i realized yeah this is what im supposed to do
8080092 if we keep getting young people like josh into education the system will succeed
8080093 i think hell have a great deal of frustration some days going home at night pulling his hair out wondering what else he can do when you bend over backwards to help certain students and they still dont want help
8080094 this is part of what is making my first semester interesting
8080095 believe that his clemens testimony in a sworn deposition on february 5 2008 and at a hearing on february 13 2008 that he never used anabolic steroids or human growth hormone warrants further investigation
8080096 roger will continue to fight these false allegations with every ounce of strength he has
8080097 we chose not to call witnesses because there was no need to the government prosecutors have put on a case that simply does not come close to meeting the standard of its burden of proof it was obvious after we went over the evidence the government presented that we could move on to closing arguments immediately and get a just acquittal for wesley on all counts listed in the indictment

8080099 gonna give he movie a bad review based on bias
8080100 there are two ways to review this movie the right way is to look at it objectively examining how the film is put together and picking apart the script by pointing out the gaping logical gaps present in it ill be reviewing the film the wrong way as a man who was once a little boy crying because optimus prime was dead now whatever is left of that kid inside me has had a wakeup call the movie hes been waiting twenty years to see is finally here optimus prime is back from the grave and he needs my help
8080101 sure dragonball is popular with 12 year olds and people who have been hit in the head by a brick
8080102 making a movie that wont be hated by everyone with an iq over 40 well with dragonball z as source material im pretty sure thats impossible
8080103 dragonball isnt that a big deal when the entire plot of the entire series is just about fighting
8080104 yes i can read it to you in a few minutes

8080106 well last night i was working on our taxes i had guessed that we were going to receive a slight refund but this morning i got up and finished entering all our gifts and exemptions and babe were getting back almost exactly 3 200

8080108 answer me when i call to you o my righteous god give me relief from my distress be merciful to me and hear my prayer
8080109 you grant him relief from days of trouble till a pit is dug for the wicked
8080110 o lord hear my prayer listen to my cry for mercy in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief
8080111 when they saw the courage of peter and john and realized that they were unschooled ordinary men they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with jesus
8080112 jesus is true and the principles found in his teachings work
8080113 therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about christ and go on to maturity and god permitting we will do so
8080114 i will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go i will counsel you and watch over you
8080115 to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the path of peace
8080116 but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears and he will tell you what is yet to come
8080117 now it came about in the course of those many days that the king of egypt died and the sons of israel sighed because of the bondage and they cried out and their cry for help because of their bondage rose up to god so god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob god saw the sons of israel and god took notice of them
8080118 this is a significant racketeering case involving alleged criminal activity spanning the globe
8080119 for we died and were buried with christ by baptism and just as christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the father now we also may live new lives
8080120 lord if you had been here my brother wouldnt have died
8080121 but even now i know that god will give you whatever you ask
8080122 yes lord i have always believed that you are the messiah the son of god the one who has come into the world from god

8080128 chrono trigger if one party member dies does he still get exp
8080129 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8080130 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8080131 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8080132 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8080133 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8080134 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8080135 i worked hard i did my job but the boys at twitter are just as churlish as the boys at sterling cooper such a pity theyre so petty
8080136 the u s government should end mandates for ethanol and let the free market work

8080170 by employing the cuda development environment to harness the parallel architecture of the gpu agilent has significantly enhanced and accelerated its tools which solve critical simulation problems for nvidia

8080229 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8080230 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8080231 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8080232 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8080233 3 on the 1 to 10 scale as far as spoilers go though read at your own risk here we go
8080234 im a morning porn peruser and not for the titillation factor i just find it interesting
8080235 ill go read google news ill go read guardian uk go read our web site and then if ive got nothing else i will just peruse the porn sites because its an ever expanding world
8080236 just when you see the most outlandish clip you could ever see somebody introduces something new i just check in periodically just to see how far porn has gone in my absence
8080237 it turns some people off but thats how mostly everybody i know speaks
8080238 its kind of strange whenever somebody goes that offends me im like wow what kind of weird opposite bizarro frame of mind do you live in cursing is just so second nature you dont even think of it as cursing any more its just your lexicon
8080239 basically its a dressed up version of making your first film it just happens to be a porn film
8080240 is the item i ordered from argos ready for pickup
8080241 i will only be in the post office a few minutes so parking wont matter
8080242 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8080243 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8080244 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8080245 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8080246 now it shall be if you diligently obey the lord your god being careful to do all his commandments which i command you today the lord your god will set you high above all the nations of the earth the lord will open for you his good storehouse the heavens to give rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hand and you shall lend to many nations but you shall not borrow
8080247 if you really want to get out of debt youve gotta get mad youve gotta get wired up and fired up youve gotta sell so much stuff the kids think theyre next we see it every single event people come to the event depressed and beaten down by debt but they leave with hope and determination to eliminate it
8080248 owe no one anything except to love one another for he who loves another has fulfilled the law
8080249 the rich rules over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender
8080250 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8080251 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8080252 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8080253 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8080254 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8080255 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8080256 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8080257 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8080258 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8080259 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8080260 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8080261 the disciplinary measures must be legal and effective resorting to corporal punishment is actually a sign of incompetency
8080262 blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you who walk in the light of your presence o lord
8080263 god is light in him there is no darkness at all
8080264 for if their purpose or activity is of human origin it will fail but if it is from god you will not be able to stop these men you will only find yourselves fighting against god
8080265 preach the gospel at all times if necessary use words
8080266 for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
8080267 and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
8080268 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
8080269 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8080270 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8080271 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8080272 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8080273 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8080274 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8080275 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8080276 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8080277 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8080278 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8080279 while the charter proposes some noble principles the conference is of the view that the interim government and the national council for building a better fiji do not have any moral or legal authority to impose it on the people
8080280 the conference is very concerned of so much suffering and poverty and the nation and people must not be subjected to any further hardships which could result from further sanctions by our neighbors and the international community
8080281 new zealand is being selective when quoting that fiji is heading to be another zimbabwe he said
8080282 currently there is a downturn in trade with the pacific region which is only one of the two in the world where new zealand has a trade surplus
8080283 we only hope that such comments dont end up causing a wave of activism that will put pressure on new zealand businesses to put curbs on trading with fiji because if fiji is cut off were effectively cut off too and for no fault of ours
8080284 any curbs on pacific trade may well be irreversible and the nzpbc has observed that a number of new zealand and australian exporters and suppliers are now sharing the fijian market with their asian counterparts mainly the peoples republic of china
8080285 make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it as on a seal holy to the lord

8080292 finally brothers whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things
8080293 praise the lord o my soul all my inmost being praise his holy name praise the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgives all your sins and heals all your deseases who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagles
8080294 forgive move on pray read the bible read books help go to pastors for counsel and prayer etc etc yet here i am still struggling
8080295 my thoughts got me into this and my thoughts and jesus can get me out
8080296 we have told the schools that they should watch out for school kids who are involved in such illegal activities
8080297 it is in this age group when people are very inquisitive because they want to try out a lot of things
8080298 warner get a real job no ones going to want a phone in the car
8080299 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8080300 including iran in a axis of evil led a iranian people to grow increasingly skeptical of american slogans
8080301 some bullying amp brazen countries amp air worthless followers of wanting to impose air will on a iranian nation
8080302 a president amp a government have stood up to air excessive dem amp s amp moved forward
8080303 is this what god means when he tells us to walk by faith and not by sight
8080304 lord what things do i need to walk by faith in and not by sight
8080305 not happy about this and to say its simply a matter of going into settings and changing the connection refs in there each time you come home and want to use wi fi is not good enough its far from simply this or simply that its simply a total pain in the arse to have to find and use workarounds like this all the time
8080306 i tried to explain it to them but they said its possible that my phone got connected to telstras network and downloaded the data which is a ridiculous excuse
8080307 if we have no culture in america why are folks on this side of the atlantic so keen on importing it
8080308 oh yeah then why do you keep importing our fast food
8080309 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8080310 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
8080311 its encouraging to see the benefit of lower gas prices helping consumers a bit
8080312 we will be brimming with pride today he has never failed to come up to scratch and for him to be honoured in this way is just fantastic
8080313 there are already several new improved versions of the kindle in the works
8080314 but amazon has no plans however for an mp3 music audio version
8080315 it is our position that the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia does not conform to international law
8080316 georgias independence and territorial integrity cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8080317 its a unilateral decision that doesnt have international support that makes it legally binding
8080318 an attack on the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
8080319 this is an unconcealed annexation of these territories which are a part of georgia
8080320 we use the same arguments as those used by the west with regard to kosovo all other possible means were exhausted there was no possible way to reconcile with georgia this is purely a continuation of the kosovo precedent
8080321 of course some western leaders will say that there is no link between kosovo and abkhazia and south ossetia but what can they say without contradicting themselves about what they said about kosovo
8080322 there are celebrations in the streets its like a holiday here
8080323 this was not an easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
8080324 tbilisi made its choice during the night of august 8 2008 saakashvili opted for genocide to accomplish his political objectives
8080325 by doing so he himself dashed all the hopes for the peaceful co existence of ossetians abkhazians and georgians in a single state
8080326 the georgian leadership in violation of the un charter and their obligations under international agreements and contrary to the voice of reason unleashed an armed conflict victimising innocent civilians
8080327 this was not an easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
8080328 we dont have to respond to every event in the world
8080329 the prime minister reaffirms his commitment to the goals of annapolis and his commitment to continue to work for a historic agreement with the target being before the end of the bush administration
8080330 god willing and with the good will of the parties and the tireless work of the parties we have a good chance of succeeding
8080331 we still have a number of months before us to work toward the annapolis goal and were going to do precisely that
8080332 we shouldnt lose another seven years searching for solutions we hope the new administration will continue what we have begun and what we have reached
8080333 these efforts havent been for nothing we would have stopped it if it was pointless there are benefits that i hope will show in the future
8080334 we have discussed the importance of reaching complete and comprehensive solutions not partial solutions
8080335 i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process that in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8080336 at the end of the day the israeli government policy is not to expand settlements it is not to build new settlements not to confiscate land from palestinians
8080337 obviously we all know the dangers of eating too much fat and cholesterol
8080338 but this seemed like a fun way to help raise awareness and money for a great cause

8080354 how are your potatoes doing any sign of the blight
8080355 i need you to advise mine are keeling over different from last year but they are not looking good the condition is gradually moving up the rows
8080356 if i was you id lift all these potatoes immediately youve got some sort of blight i reckon
8080357 the skin is set lift them before you lose them
8080358 i had the same symptoms out of 144 yards 130 metres of potato plants i harvested just three sacks maureen was surprised when she saw me washing the tiny ones i wouldnt have bothered in past years the little ones were so sweet and tasty but i was gutted by the low harvest apart from last year i have always grown all our own potatoes now we will have to buy them they just dont taste the same and the prices make me shudder
8080359 i went to law school on a full academic scholarship the only one in my law school to have a full academic scholarship

8080361 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for
8080362 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be a fair and neutral party took this step
8080363 over a four year period bain hogg documented different aspects of the underworld from exile in tenerife to the broad spectrum of activity in the uk
8080364 its a fairly major release for us as a lot of code had to be re engineered for microsofts new platform
8080365 you can stream an application to a user with a laptop for offline use for example but if they are using an internet kiosk at the airport you wouldnt want to have the application streamed to that device
8080366 for most users this is important in improving their experience
8080367 instead of looking at specific technologies such as laptop or usb encryption the focus should be on encrypting files and folders at source
8080368 dealing with third party firms is a routine business transaction but you cannot always rely on a third party to have as stringent security systems in place as your own
8080369 service is not a silo how you pull together and present it will affect the overall customer experience and expectations today are very high
8080370 people are increasingly dealing with large sophisticated cases coming from multiple jurisdictions and in multiple languages
8080371 this tool is extremely helpful to speed things up and make things more accurate
8080372 enabling im and other types of web 2 0 communication can bring great benefits to companies but it departments need to consider the risks involved and make sure that security policy control and compliance are introduced as standard best practice
8080373 in activities such as marketing it is valuable to find and spend effort on several key influences that are trusted information sources used by other network participants
8080374 companies should work the network and find out where their customers and potential employees are making decisions
8080375 slowness to respond can cost firms incredibly large sums of money and may drive them out of business all together
8080376 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health
8080377 with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout

8080388 trying to hit barack obama for not standing up to russia as aggressively as mccain after the invasion of georgia romney twice referred to
8080389 excuse me for the slip if i said soviets i meant the russians
8080390 and if the soviets were to invade poland we might be in armed conflict but the soviets are not going to invade poland because poland is in nato
8080391 theres a good chance that john will pick a vp who criticized him during the primaries on taxes and such but the difference it was one or two issues not the core idea of the ability to be president
8080392 i think whats hdrunk newspening is were in our denver bubble ares 1 3 of a democratic establishment here who would be big time players had clinton won amp ay can stoke this a little a mccain campaign is stoking this releasing this ad

8080395 american natural gas production is rising at a clip not seen in half a century pushing down prices of the fuel and reversing conventional wisdom that domestic gas fields were in irreversible decline
8080396 right at the time oil prices are skyrocketing were struggling with the economy were concerned about global warming and national security threats remain intense we wake up and weve got this abundance of natural gas around us
8080397 a texas company says that it has developed a cheaper and cleaner way to convert natural gas into gasoline and other liquid fuels making it economical to tap natural gas reserves that in the past have been too small or remote to develop
8080398 well maybe the world is older than six thousand years maybe it is millions or possibly hundreds of millions of years old but billions thats just crazy
8080399 nottinghamshire hmmm that is a big place this will be a fairly big event we will see teddy bears from miles around each more cute and cuddly and reasonably priced than the last

8080401 now what do you do throw out a red handkerchief whats the format what do you do id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie
8080402 imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8080403 nobodys told us anything i think we should be schooled on it somehow
8080404 this is not going to work come on i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8080405 all we get all spring is directive after directive about how to speed up the game this certainly is not going to speed up the game
8080406 this is not like football youve got a pitcher whos standing out there
8080407 an unknown male entered the playlot and sat on a different bench
8080408 absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8080409 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8080410 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8080411 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood
8080412 today i was so happy to get a job at last to feed my wife and two kids
8080413 i used to work as day laborer in construction but theres no construction in the area and its hard to find work
8080414 we will beat terrorism and al qaeda we will not abandon our work
8080415 if we do so we will abandon our honor as well because al qaeda would take full control over our area
8080416 j tinha conversado com o perdig o que meu amigo de outros tempos e ele perguntou com quem comemoraria o primeiro gol p o primeiro n o podia ser com ele tinha que ser com o mano
8080417 mas eu me preparei para a minha estr ia no corinthians conversei com a minha esposa priscila sobre isso e sab amos que eu estava bem comemorei com o mano mas a minha dedicat ria vai para ela
8080418 you dont actually win a campaign on election day you find out the results on election day the actual winning starts much much earlier
8080419 these are just a few of the 50 outstanding candidates for change that are running across the country from alabama to alaska from new york to new mexico and right here in the great state of colorado
8080420 we must succeed because if we make the right choice this election it will mean a new direction for america and the world for years to come
8080421 i dont care what jesse jackson does im going to this convention and im going to win
8080422 obama agrees to roll call vote for clinton does that make him a sissy
8080423 the democratic national convention is now shaping up to be quite a party for hillary clinton her name will be placed in nomination shell give a prime time address
8080424 overall between 1972 and 1992 10 democratic candidates who lost the nomination in the primaries went on to have their names formally placed in nomination at the convention
8080425 sure hillarys fat and waddly and screechy and gives pantsuits a bad name
8080426 reports of strife between negotiators for sen hillary clinton and sen barack obama are exaggerated
8080427 multiple sources in both campaigns have described the negotiations as relatively free of acrimony
8080428 my sources say the obama campaign was enthusiastic about the idea of putting clintons name in nomination having independently reached the conclusion that it was the best way to honor her achievement and do more to win over her supporters
8080429 the conversations with her folks were very cordial and weve been able to work very closely with them as we unify this party we couldnt be happier about how things are going with senator clinton and her team
8080430 hillary clintons attempt tacitly to take over the obama victory
8080431 i thought journalists were supposed to uncover the facts and report the story not decide on the story and then interpret the facts to accommodate their storyline
8080432 russia rolls over georgia hillary clinton does the same to barack obama now we know whos boss
8080433 if hillary clinton can ride roughshod over this guy what do you think bin laden will do
8080434 russia invades georgia hillary invades obamas convention obama does nothing constructive on either count

8080438 too bad the conservative party doesnt invest this much brain power into actually solving the countrys problems and governing instead of endlessly scheming of ways to hold onto power
8080439 someone being concerned about a paper cut and setting themselves on fire as a consequence
8080440 they like it so much they are bringing us back for some encore time to beef it up
8080441 i know theyve been showing it to some people and some people go i want to see a little more of this or i dont quite understand this
8080442 it sure would have been nice to know that this was an outside event i would have at least brought a blanket
8080443 what in the wide wide world of sports is a goin on here i hired you boys to try and get a little track laid not dance around like a bunch of kansas city fagots
8080444 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8080445 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8080446 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8080447 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8080448 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8080449 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8080450 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8080451 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8080452 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8080453 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8080454 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8080455 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8080456 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8080457 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8080458 feminism is a socialist anti family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians
8080459 the most difficult challenge now is to win over the people who were disappointed when i left now im back ill try my hardest its all i know how to do

8080468 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself

8080484 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
8080485 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
8080486 we confirmed these results with a wide range of model reliability tests and sensitivity analyses to make sure that the findings we found were not a result of some unobserved third factor
8080487 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
8080488 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist

8080499 alla scuola dei padri per entrare nel mistero della salvezza
8080500 oltre che maestri del mistero della salvezza ha spiegato i padri ci sono anche testimoni dellimpegno pastorale della chiesa antica un impegno caratterizzato come la loro riflessione teologica dalla consapevolezza della priorit della salvezza nel progetto di dio per luomo

8080517 one of the two or three most ambitious plans around and its the largest
8080518 more appealing buildings are on campus causing students to want to live here
8080519 tcu guarantees that any student who applies before may 1 will have campus housing
8080520 this is a way we could help out during a time when tcu had more students than it had space for
8080521 the pool table will stay because we are hoping these students will be able to move out soon
8080522 im feeling confident and i feel like im just really really really enjoying myself
8080523 ive been feeling good about my serve for a long time now its definitely one of my strongest shots and today it was there again
8080524 i was doing a lot of the things well to the olympics and i was really confident coming in here
8080525 to me it doesnt matter whos in the draw i always come to a tournament trying to do my best and i never look at anyone else as like theyre favourites to win
8080526 because i keep losing matches i shouldnt lose one year i really ran into a lot of bad luck where i got the worst calls possible i couldnt even hit a shot because i was so nervous they would call every ball out

8080535 when you look at the beginnings of aboriginal activism you see that many of the issues in those early stirrings were later identified with the anti war movement for example
8080536 what im suggesting through this book is that indigenous australians and their supporters were responsible for a lot of the changes that we might see as the 60s phenomenon and were involved in that well before the popular stereotypes of the 60s emerged
8080537 the story of the coming of the 60s to australia is the story of aborigines and activism
8080538 this is an extremely exciting and busy time for both kookaburra and myself its such a joy and pleasure to take these shows to country nsw after the childhood the country has given me its a delight to give something back

8080560 the flow on effect will mean that all businesses in the wider community will suffer financially
8080561 the proposed privatisation will be bad for electricity workers small businesses the environment public services and all consumers across the entire state
8080562 senior citizens on fixed incomes will also be affected electricity prices in queensland and victorian privatised markets have risen by approximately 11 and 17 per cent this year
8080563 the loss of hundreds of workers in this economy will lead directly to business closures port macquarie will be launched into a protracted recession
8080564 the rapp team have shown us that if the community unite and move as one change is possible
8080565 port macquarie has more to lose than most so we need to unite as a community and join the state in a fight to stop the sell off
8080566 i call on the chamber of commerce the churches senior citizen groups and all aspiring political players in the coming elections to get together in a community campaign to protect our town if youre passionate about this community youll be there
8080567 as we saw at latrobe valley people will go out of business as families are forced to leave port
8080568 the only way to avoid the morris iemma recession in port is for the community to gather its united voice we have decided that cape will be a non partisan group our door will be open to support from all sectors of the community and all local political players who have stated that they oppose the sell off we hope that this campaign can act to bring ports community together in a common cause after so much recent division
8080569 the community groups granted funding cover the whole community in all sorts of ways suicide prevention drug rehabilitation and education life saving work to woodworking and so on the good that comes out of it is mind boggling
8080570 and the people behind most of these organisations are volunteers last year the funding allowed us to buy new equipment to make our job safer and create better conditions for our volunteers and because of these good conditions we have attracted more volunteers which means we are able to do more for the community
8080571 this is the fourth year the cdse funding from the north haven bowling club has paid for the feeding and farrier costs for joe black for 12 months
8080572 he is an essential part of our riding program loved by many of our riders we have eight horses out there and always looking for sponsorship for the others
8080573 weve also received funding from the laurieton united servicemens club to buy a large handled saddle which will mean more comfort safety and stability for some of our larger adult riders
8080574 this is the first time the elders group has received funding it will be used to coordinate the groups in different local communities gather together on a regular basis because they have such a wealth of knowledge and we want to create a meeting place for them to yarn and participate in traditional activities record stories and work to develop more regular meetings this will help the elders hopefully take on more leadership roles and mentoring young people womens groups and mens groups and practise traditional activities
8080575 clubs create great social meeting places and activities which generate funding for community programs
8080576 the study will involve the undertaking of very comprehensive environmental assessments further consultations with the community and key stakeholders and reporting of the outcomes
8080577 completion of the studies is expected during early 2009 followed by submission of a development application to obtain the necessary environmental approvals for the project
8080578 once the environmental approvals are obtained council will review the timing of bridge replacement in consultation with the community and project funding partners the roads amp traffic authority

8080588 if woolworths appeal to the supreme court is successful and woolworths is granted a clearance foodstuffs will also face no competition issues if it decides to purchase further shares in the warehouse
8080589 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful again both companies are in the same position
8080590 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8080591 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward

8080669 without easter calvary was just another political execution of a failed messiah without easter the world is trapped between the shoulder shrug of the cynic the fantasy of the escapist and the tanks of the the tyrant without easter there is no reason to suppose that good will triumph over evil that love will win over hatred that life will win over death but with easter we have hope because hope depends on love and love has become human and has died and is alive for evermore and holds the keys of death and hades it is because of him that we know we dont just hope we know that god will wipe away all tears from all eyes and in that knowledge we find ourselves to be sunday people called to live in a world of fridays in that knowledge we know ourselves to be easter people called to minister to a world full of calvarys in that knowledge we find that the hand that dries our tears passes the cloth on to us and bids us to follow him to go to dry one anothers tears the lamb calls us to follow him wherever he goes into the dark places of the world the dark places of our hearts the places where tears blot out the sunlight and he bids us shine his morning light into the darkness and share his ministry of wiping away the tears and as we worship and adore and follow the lamb we join already in the song of revelation 5 11 14 the song that one day the trees and the mountains and the whales and the waterfalls the whold world reborn on easter morning will sing with us worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing to him who sits on the throne and to the lamb be blessing and honour and glory and power forever and ever amen

8080740 the second commandment of the teaching you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not seduce boys you shall not commit fornication you shall not steal you shall not practice magic you shall not use potions you shall not procure an abortion nor destroy a newborn child
8080741 the way of light then is as follows if anyone desires to travel to the appointed place he must be zealous in his works the knowledge therefore which is given to us for the purpose of walking in this way is the following thou shalt not slay the child by procuring abortion nor again shalt thou destroy it after it is born
8080742 and near that place i saw another strait place and there sat women and over against them many children who were born to them out of due time sat crying and there came forth from them rays of fire and smote the women in the eyes and these were the accursed who conceived and caused abortion
8080743 what man of sound mind therefore will affirm while such is our character that we are murderers w hen we say that those women who use drugs to bring on abortion commit murder and will have to give an account to god for the abortion on what principle should we commit murder for it does not belong to the same person to regard the very fetus in the womb as a created being and therefore an object of gods care and when it has passed into life to kill it and not to expose an infant because those who expose them are chargeable with child murder and on the other hand when it has been reared to destroy it
8080744 in our case a murder being once for all forbidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from the other parts of the body for its sustenance to hinder a birth is merely a speedier man killing nor does it matter whether you take away a life that is born or destroy one that is coming to birth that is a man which is going to be one you have the fruit already in its seed
8080745 among surgeons tools there is a certain instrument which is formed with a nicely adjusted flexible frame for opening the uterus first of all and keeping it open it is further furnished with an annular blade by means of which the limbs of the child within the womb are dissected with anxious but unfaltering care its last appendage being a blunted or covered hook wherewith the entire fetus is extracted by a violent delivery
8080746 there is also another instrument in the shape of a copper needle or spike by which the actual death is managed in this furtive robbery of life they give it from its infanticide function the name of
8080747 the doctors who performed abortions all knew well enough that a living being had been conceived and they pitied this most luckless infant state which had first to be put to death to escape being tortured alive
8080748 now we allow that life begins with conception because we contend that the soul also begins from conception life taking its commencement at the same moment and place that the soul does
8080749 the law of moses indeed punishes with due penalties the man who shall cause abortion ex
8080750 there are some pagan women who by drinking medical preparations extinguish the source of the future man in their very bowels and thus commit a parricide before they bring forth and these things assuredly come down from the teaching of your false gods to us christians it is not lawful either to see or hear of homicide
8080751 women who were reputed to be believers began to take drugs to render themselves sterile and to bind themselves tightly so as to expel what was being conceived since they would not on account of relatives and excess wealth want to have a child by a slave or by any insignificant person see then into what great impiety that lawless one has proceeded by teaching adultery and murder at the same time
8080752 concerning women who commit fornication and destroy that which they have conceived or who are employed in making drugs for abortion a former decree excluded them until the hour of death and to this some have assented nevertheless being desirous to use somewhat greater lenity we have ordained that they fulfill ten years of penance according to the prescribed degrees
8080753 let her that procures abortion undergo ten years penance whether the embryo were perfectly formed or not
8080754 he that kills another with a sword or hurls an axe at his own wife and kills her is guilty of willful murder not he who throws a stone at a dog and unintentionally kills a man or who corrects one with a rod or scourge in order to reform him or who kills a man in his own defense when he only designed to hurt him but the man or woman is a murderer that gives a philtrum if the man that takes it dies upon it so are they who take medicines to procure abortion and so are they who kill on the highway and rapparees
8080755 wherefore i beseech you flee fornication why sow where the ground makes it its care to destroy the fruit where there are many efforts at abortion where there is murder before the birth for even the harlot you do not let continue a mere harlot but make her a murderess also you see how drunkenness leads to prostitution prostitution to adultery adultery to murder or rather to a something even worse than murder for i have no name to give it since it does not take off the thing born but prevents its being born why then do thou abuse the gift of god and fight with his laws and follow after what is a curse as if a blessing and make the chamber of procreation a chamber for murder and arm the woman that was given for childbearing unto slaughter for with a view to drawing more money by being agreeable and an object of longing to her lovers even this she is not backward to do so heaping upon thy head a great pile of fire for even if the daring deed be hers yet the causing of it is thine
8080756 i cannot bring myself to speak of the many virgins who daily fall and are lost to the bosom of the church their mother some go so far as to take potions that they may insure barrenness and thus murder human beings almost before their conception some when they find themselves with child through their sin use drugs to procure abortion and when as often happens they die with their offspring they enter the lower world laden with the guilt not only of adultery against christ but also of suicide and child murder
8080757 thou shalt not use magic thou shalt not use witchcraft for he says you shall not suffer a witch to live ex 22 18 thou shall not slay thy child by causing abortion nor kill that which is begotten i f it be slain it shall be avenged as being unjustly destroyed
8080758 there is no question about that which is bred in the uterus both growing and moving from place to place it remains therefore that we must think that the point of commencement of existence is one and the same for body and soul

8080820 nos ha costado atacar al inicio el problema es que atacar nos generaba una cierta dificultad porque no sab amos si ir hacia arriba o guardar el resultado cuando se juega as sin saber lo que hay que hacer es complicado hemos jugado pensando en el resultado
8080821 pese a que encajamos el gol muy pronto creo que desde el inicio ya hemos salido con otro tono y hemos acabado fallando muchas ocasiones m s de las que ha tenido el rival en la primera mitad hemos ido a contemporizar y ello nos ha perjudicado hemos intentado no pensar durante ese periodo pero nos ha sido imposible algo que hemos podido subsanar en la segunda parte
8080822 poner al mejor equipo posible en estos momentos hemos eliminado a un rival de mucha entidad y a un muy buen equipo
8080823 a ver c mo nos recuperamos del esfuerzo todos los partidos tienen su dificultad y el de numancia tambi n lo tendr hay que sacar lecciones de las derrotas cada partido es una historia ahora empieza la liga en la que un equipo defiende el campeonato y nosotros vamos a intentar sac rselo desde el inicio
8080824 perder nunca nos gusta pero no tengo nada que reprochar por c mo ha llegado la derrota porque hemos jugado en l neas generales un muy buen partido hay matices peque os pero el comportamiento de mis jugadores ha sido excelente
8080825 creo que hemos jugado bien y hemos creado m s ocasiones que nuestro rival para llevarnos el partido es lo nico que puedo decir no hemos sido precisos aqu pero tampoco en la ida en la que tuvimos ocasiones para irnos con un resultado m s amplio que el que logramos
8080826 je dois lui annoncer la mauvaise nouvelle encore et encore
8080827 claro que a nadie le gusta perder pero lo importante era clasificarse para la champions
8080828 sta era uno de los compromisos claves de la temporada una aut ntica final ya que nos jug bamos estar en la m xima competici n lo hemos superado y hay que estar contentos pese a que hemos tenido ocasiones para ganar tambi n hoy
8080829 las ocasiones perdidas no hemos sabido aprovecharlas pienso que m s que falta de eficacia nos ha faltado suerte pero en fin lo m s importante es que estaremos en la champions ahora hay que centrarnos en la liga espero que ante el numancia tengamos mayor fortuna que esta noche
8080830 sin hacer un gran partido hemos tenido muchas m s oportunidades que ellos y debimos ganar ha sido realmente un partido raro pero en fin lo importante es que estamos otra vez en la champions veremos qu nos depara el sorteo
8080831 el equipo llega muy bien a la liga hoy se ha podido ver que hemos aguantado muy bien hasta el final mientras muchos de nuestro rivales ten an rampas
8080832 no hemos logrado un buen resultado pero hemos trabajado bastante bien tras conseguir el primer objetivo afrontamos la liga con muchas ganas e ilusi n hay que comenzarla de la mejor manera pienso que el campeonato no se juega contra el madrid sino contra nosotros mismos si estamos a nuestro nivel es dif cil que nos superen
8080833 when i look at you all i do is smile you did a great job tonight

8080837 quite frankly the results were pretty dismal and we dont see a return to the high earnings levels of previous years any time soon
8080838 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints

8080847 it will create new pressures on the regional level throughout the caucasus and further complicates international affairs among the powers of the world

8080875 what i havent been taking money from is corporate pacs and the reason i havent is because i think right now that corporations exercise too much influence in washington d c whether its the energy companies insurance companies or the pharmaceutical companies and i think its undeniable that they have effected policy by paying by funding campaigns of both parties and so im proud of the fact that im not taking money from them

8081000 we just had a similar meet and greet type event in philadelphia last week
8081001 were doing it to strengthen community relations and improve recruitment diversity
8081002 in pennsylvania we only have 205 female officers approximately 73 latino men and somewhere around 197 african americans which doesnt reflect the population
8081003 well have a mobile recruitment office and give information meet people and answer questions
8081004 i think the event will also help people get to know us better
8081005 some people are intimidated by the police which we dont want we have things to show people and will put on some demonstrations were going to bring a rollover simulator that lets people see what happens to someone in a car crash who isnt wearing a seat belt
8081006 over all we want to get in touch with the public
8081007 learned in general terms on july 23rd and staff informed him of the diagnosis shortly thereafter
8081008 suppose rendell would have a heart attack god forbid then youd have the executive branch headless obviously the lieutenant governor would not be able to perform the duties of governor
8081009 is a health issue more important or germane to public discussion if its the governor or lieutenant governor
8081010 each agency has its own culture or practices what we sought to do is find a model that would incorporate all the components of recognized diversity best practices
8081011 there is a need to do more outreach in the minority community and to do more recruitment for jobs

8081015 mccain was born the son and grandson of admirals in coco sola panama on 29 august 1936 as a self confessed military brat he inevitably chose a navy career there was no other option for the grandson of john slew mccain a man who had commanded aircraft carriers in the second world war slew mccain was so driven that when the navy passed a rule saying only aviators could command a carrier the old man went to flight school while in his fifties he crashed five planes before finally getting his wings and then his carrier in one pacific battle planes under slew mccains command sank 49 japanese ships in a single day
8081016 john mccains grandfather was a gaunt hawk faced man known as slew by his fellow officers and afectionately as popeye by the sailors who served under him mccain sr played the horses drank bourbon and water and rolled his own cigarettes with one hand more significant he was one of the navys greatest commanders and led the strongest aircraft carrier force of the third fleet in key battles during wwii john mccains father followed a similar path equally distinguished by heroic service in the navy as a submarine commander during wwii mccain jr was a slightly built man but like his father he earned the respect and affection of his men he too rose to the rank of four star admiral making the mccains the first family in american history to achieve that distinction mccain jr s final assignment was as commander of all u s forces in the pacific during the vietnam war
8081017 as for accidents plenty of pilots have accidents and dont lose their wings or still finish flight school six thousand planes have been lost in training exercises off florida alone
8081018 mccain was practicing landings his engine quit and his plane plunged into corpus christi bay knocked unconscious by the impact he came to as the plane settled to the bottom cracking the canopy against the weight of the water he squeezed out and fought his way to the surface where he was raced to the dispensary
8081019 flying too low over the iberian peninsula he took out some power lines which lead to aspate of newspapers stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral the tale has gotten better with age these days they talk about the day mccain turned the light out in spain

8081030 with explosions continuing and a fire raging it is quite treacherous for rescuers since there are huge amid the blasts along with leaks of toxic gases such as ammonia and formaldehyde
8081031 the pilot relayed to the airport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refueled to go to paris
8081032 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8081033 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had coordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8081034 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8081035 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8081036 we had three senior members on the plane and some other people they got on and someone hijacked it
8081037 about half an hour after takeoff a hijacker demanded to go to
8081038 to start to develop the vast pre salt reserves of the santos basin
8081039 the problem is not to blame the problem is to understand the process
8081040 in five years we will not do everything also the next government will blame us
8081041 we saw the weaknesses of the government and that we are now going to change

8081047 en el 2009 estar en el mundial y puede que incluso este mismo a o
8081048 s quiero volver y no descarto incluso que reaparezca esta temporada
8081049 he aprovechado los test con ducati para ponerme en forma
8081050 ahora mismo estoy abierto a cualquier opci n pero mis prioridades son divertirme y despu s ser competitivo si se dan estos dos factores volver a las carreras
8081051 a n tengo una opci n para volver este mismo a o pero pueden pasar muchas cosas y espero que sean buenas para m ahora las cosas est n de mi parte
8081052 en 2007 otro piloto choc contra m en la primera curva
8081053 parece peque a y estrecha pero la de misano es una de las pistas m s r pidas del calendario tiene un buen agarre aunque el a o pasado estaba muy bacheada
8081054 el circuito est a muy pocos kil metros de la casa de rossi as que las gradas estar n abarrotadas de tifosi
8081055 no es normal que se repita la cat strofe de brno en misano debemos empezar a solucionar problemas
8081056 me dijo que han mejorado bastantes cosas desde que lo prob por primera vez y algunos cambios influyen tambi n en el pilotaje en aspectos que a m me gustan creo que los dos motores est n todav a parejos y sin haberlo probado no me parece que sea momento de meterlo en carrera aunqu s lo probar en los tests del lunes
8081057 ellos no reconocen el problema son unos arrogantes el problema no es de pedrosa ni de honda es de los que hacen los neum ticos normalmente soy muy vergonzoso pero nunca hab a tenido tanta verg enza como hoy por el domingo de carrera al tener que pilotar en estas condiciones
8081058 misano no es un circuito particularmente duro para las gomas es similar al de barcelona
8081059 parece que en michelin no est n muy convencidos de haber encontrado el motivo de sus errores y adem s todav a no nos han convencido a nosotros
8081060 tenemos que convencerles para que fabriquen m s neum ticos
8081061 ya lo estuvimos hablando hace tiempo adem s su planificaci n pasaba por los juegos ol mpicos y la vuelta a espa a
8081062 el recorrido es poco selectivo por lo que el planteamiento es tener dos l deres valverde y freire s lo alejandro tendr libertad para meterse en alg n corte si no trabajaremos para defender la suerte de oscar en un sprint
8081063 espero que sean conscientes de lo que han conseguido y de lo orgullosos que estamos los vascos por su haza a
8081064 estuvimos media hora pensando que ramos ganadores han sido unos d as muy duros y ahora queremos olvidar toda esta pol mica sigo sin entender la decisi n del tribunal y no me parece justa pero no hay m s remedio que acatarla
8081065 la gente sin entrada vio la carrera mejor que yo
8081066 sigo la f1 desde que ten a 15 a os y nunca me hab a pasado algo as
8081067 desde la primera tanda nos dimos cuenta de que los coches s lo se ve an durante un segundo las gradas eran muy bajas y ten an poca inclinaci n por lo que encima las cabezas de la gente te acababan impidiendo ver nada
8081068 el viernes por la tarde nos acercamos a la sede de valmor y antes de que la polic a nos echara nos dijeron que o nos reubicar an o que nos devolver an el dinero pero que en cualquier caso nos llamar an el viernes por la tarde para decir algo a n espero la llamada
8081069 he presentado una reclamaci n a consumo en mollet del vall s pido que me devuelvan el dinero de las dos entradas pero tambi n del hotel y la gasolina porque viaj a valencia s lo para ver la f1 si no me responden optar por la v a penal
8081070 valencia ha hecho un circuito pensando en los pilotos pero para los espectadores fue un desastre espero que s lo sea un error de principiante y que el a o que viene que espero volver lo arreglen
8081071 im looking forward to working exclusively with dx to release my latest installment of the bar exam series bar exam 2 as a free digital download the reason we decided to do this as a free digital download is because i wanted to give the fans an opportunity to see where i am as an artist and what to expect from me in the near future
8081072 we wanted to get a host who could carry the torch behind the incredible job of statik selektah and dj premier dj green lantern was the obvious choice but due to our hectic schedules we didnt know if it would work out green has been on the road the entire summer with rock the bells djing for nas and releasing mix cds with other artists but we finally found a date and time that would work best for both of us and now were able to bring the fans a worth the wait follow up
8081073 my main focus was to work with artists from the d to further expand what was started by shady with me and d12 almost 10 years ago these are artists that i not only respect but who are creating and building a huge buzz in and for our city
8081074 look out for the bar exam 2 exclusively on dx happy bar exam 2 bitches its a holiday
8081075 hay varias parejas de baile en el mundo del deporte estados unidos y china rusia y gran breta a australia y alemania nosotros no nos podemos comparar a estos pa ses porque somos m s peque os pero s con otros de referencia e importantes como pueden ser los casos de suecia dinamarca y hungr a
8081076 un 35 de los deportistas de la delegaci n espa ola son catalanes y tenemos alrededor del 40 de las medallas conseguidas tambi n se ha ganado en la igualdad en se l s lo hab a el 15 catalanas y ahora estamos en el 40 es el resultado de una efectividad en busca de rentabilidad estamos satisfechos
8081077 catalunya lo pidi en 1991 y es la nica solicitud no contestada por lo que la petici n formal sigue viva y se hizo cuando hab a unas normas determinadas aunque luego se cambiara la carta ol mpica
8081078 se necesita el soporte de cinco federaciones internacionales reconocidas por el cio es un problema pol tico antes de su renovaci n el cio reconoc a territorios deportivos y cuando se cambia de criterio y se incluyen estados reconocidos por la onu es para que no puedan entrar catalunya y gibraltar
8081079 es nuestro objetivo e ilusi n y queremos que sea una realidad
8081080 hay que trabajar en silencio porque el nivel del deporte catal n es muy alto y trabajamos con una buena base
8081081 habr a que imaginar en lo que quedar a y donde estar a espa a sin la tercera parte de atletas catalanes y sin los 56 nacionalizados alg n pa s tiene un equipo de basket como podr amos tener nosotros o de hockey podr a espa a ser medalla de plata sin catalanes
8081082 esta vez en la villa ol mpica no se ven banderas catalanas porque hay consignas claras y el deportista no quiere comprometerse
8081083 estamos preparando con las federaciones programas t cnicos coincidiendo con los ciclos ol mpicos tambi n con los clubs ya que catalunya es muy fuerte en deportes de equipos tenemos 65 clubs en el primer nivel una cifra que triplica a los de andalucia y doble a los de madrid en los ltimos 10 a os el 45 de los t tulos en deportes colectivos han sido para catalunya menos en volei y balonmano femenino tenemos representaci n en todo
8081084 tenemos acuerdos explica niub cerrados para 5 a os y eso nos da tranquilidad pero es un esfuerzo que no tiene retorno lo hacemos a cambio de no poder poner catalunya en ning n sitio es como el pag s que quita las piedras siembra y trabaja el campo y luego no puede recoger los frutos qu hacemos pagando el car de sant cugat cuando los de madrid y andalucia los paga el csd
8081085 ha costado 400 000 euros y el csd nos dijo que no ten a dinero
8081086 so theyre seeing the rich customers slow down in payments slow down in purchases
8081087 but i pay a lot of attention to that sort of thing and incidentally it will get cured at some time in the future but right now the situation is getting worse and i would say that i dont see any early end to that
8081088 i dont think the intrinsic business value shrunk in fact i said i thought it probably increased a touch
8081089 the soul of the machines has always been a part of our music trance always belongs to repetition and everybody is looking for trance in life in sex in the emotional in pleasure in anything so the machines produce an absolutely perfec t trance
8081090 you gotta look at it like techno is technological its an attitude to making music that sounds futuristic something that hasnt been done before
8081091 when we started it was like shock silence where do we stand nothing we had no father figures no continuous tradition of entertainment through the 50s and 60s everything was americanized directed toward consumer behavior we were part of this 1968 movement where suddenly there were possibilities then we started to establish some form of german industrial sound
8081092 i dont think they even knew how big they were among the black masses back in 77 when they came out with trans europe express when that came out i thought that was one of the best and weirdest records i ever heard in my life
8081093 just like detroit a complete mistake its like george clinton and kraftwerk stuck in an elevator
8081094 everything has a subconscious effect on what i do in the 1970s i was into parliament funkadelic as far back as 69 they were making records like maggot brain america eats its young but if you want the reason why that happened in detroit you have to look at a dj called electrifying mojo he had five hours every night with no format restrictions it was on his show that i first heard kraftwerk
8081095 he had one of the first roland sequencers a roland msk 100 i was around when you had to get a bass player a guitarist a drummer to make records you had all these egos flying around it was hard to get a consistent thought i wanted to make electronic music but thought you had to be a computer programmer to do it i found out it wasnt as complicated as i thought our first record was alleys of your mind it sold about 15 000 locally
8081096 we had always been into futurism we had a whole load of concepts for cybotron a whole techno speak dictionary an overall idea which we called the grid it was like a video game which you entered on different levels
8081097 in one generation from a wealthy white industrial giant to a poverty stricken black metropolis
8081098 you can look at the state of detroit as a plus
8081099 all right you only take 15 minutes to get from one side of the city center to the other and the main department store is boarded up but were at the forefron here when the new technology came in detroit collapsed as an industrial city but detroit is techno city its getting better its coming back around
8081100 you have the capability of storing a vast amount of information in a smaller place
8081101 because of the way that the media works dance culture happens very quickly its not hard to hype something up
8081102 when the first techno records came in the early model 500 reese and derrick may material i wanted to follow up the detroit connection
8081103 derrick came over with a bag of tapes some of which didnt have any name tracks which are now classics like sinister and strings of life
8081104 at the time everything was house house house we thought of motor city house music that kind of thing but derrick kevin and juan kept on using the word techno they had it in their heads without articulating it it was already part of their language
8081105 the detroit innovators couldnt take it to the next stage what did was that kids in the u k and europe started learning how to make those techno records they werent as well made but they had the same energy and by 1990 91 things became more interesting because instead of three people in detroit you suddenly had 23 people making techno in belgium in sheffield
8081106 im bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher in other words sucker there is no other i wanna kiss myself
8081107 we had new beat which was slowed down industrial music cabaret voltaire and throbbing gristle were very big in belgium detroit techno and acid house came in and everything got mixed up together
8081108 the only way to be in a band and be successful is to make dance records
8081109 all these industrial places influence the music that you make electronic music is relevant because of the subliminal influence of industrial sounds you go around sheffield and its full of crap concrete architecture built in the 60s you go down in to an area called the canyon and you have these massive black factories belching out smoke banging away they dont sound a lot different from the music
8081110 cabaret voltaire had just finished a period on a major label emi and we werent working together i spent a lot of time going to clubs and working in the studio with parrot a dj who ran the citys main club night jive turkey we made a record as sweet exorcist called test one which we made to play in the club it was very very minimal warp was a shop where everyone bought american imports and they put it out we started to move seriously in that direction
8081111 it was too simplistic crude and aggressive we were getting sent lots of tracks that we couldnt sell on singles so we thought lets just do an lp we got the title
8081112 ninety per cent of the techno records you hear now are made for a fucked up dance floor
8081113 thats what i see now in a lot of clubs no vibe no motivation aggression the drugs have taken over the majority dont understand it yet but most of the guys who are really good like derrick may dont take drugs techno was a sound but it is now an attitude and thats to make records for drug oriented people there is another category where people are making music for you to pay attention with your full mind and were trying to make something now that will last
8081114 i believe that the 70s are parallel for whats going on in the 90s
8081115 musical moods tend to be a reaction against what has just gone on weve just had a very aggressive period the original detroit techno is very sophisticated what were putting out now wild planet f u s e has a similar level of sophistication the real change for us since we started is the fact that this music is 99 per cent white but the idea of raising techno to an artier level is really exciting
8081116 there is virtually no artist loyalty in dance music the record is more important than the artist dance is incredibly fast moving which is good but very difficult to build careers in
8081117 ive been making music for a long time much of it has been very cold very aggressive very stark its time to do something that makes you feel good that makes you feel warm
8081118 a lot of it was kind of as we planned
8081119 but nobody knew it would be a global thing as it is now from little detroit
8081120 we have played and been understood in detroit and japan
8081121 thats the most fascinating thing that could happen electronic music is a kind of world music it may be a couple of generations yet but i think that the global village is coming
8081122 im very optimistic this is a very good time to be alive right now
8081123 hay una expectativa muy grande por los anuncios de aumento a las jubilaciones no solo porque es una necesidad sino porque adem s la justicia ha determinado que as se haga
8081124 hay una necesidad de mejorar las asignaciones familiares y de aumentar el monto del m nimo no imponible es una necesidad
8081125 el a o pasado el gobierno hizo anuncios de aumentos de estos mismo temas en esta fecha o un poquito m s adelante estamos dentro de los plazos del a o pasado

8081167 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8081168 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8081169 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8081170 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8081171 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama

8081184 evangelical christianity in america is dying the great evangelical movements of today are not a vanguard they are a remnant unraveling at every edge
8081185 let me stop here and define what i meant by evangelicals when i began i meant those people who have accepted jesus as their personal savior and as the only way to heaven who accept the bible as the inerrant word of god and who are scaring the bejesus out of the rest of america we might even call them rove ite evangelicals after george w bushs political adviser who used them so well that the most fervent members of the southern baptist convention and other so called bible based churches have come to define evangelical faith in the popular mind they are often called the religious right
8081186 political power was in some ways the least of it they had split the methodists presbyterians and episcopalians asunder and were stealing multitudes of roman catholics away from the mother church
8081187 if the rumors are true something vital in our heritage is about to be lost
8081188 they learn to communicate in a sort of verbal shorthand that has depths of meaning to it but sounds like jargon and nonsense to others
8081189 far right republicans libertarians right wing cranks homophobes racists anti tax crusaders and small government fanatics
8081190 evangelicals make up more of their clients than anyone else
8081191 the convention floor interviews showed a side of the baptists i remembered from y childhood many were reasonable thoughtful devout and measured they had those qualities when i agreed with them and they had those qualities when i disagreed with them a lot of them were open minded enough that they could and would talk about anything squelching debate or taking over america was nothing they had the slightest interest in doing
8081192 the fallout has been so severe that columnist cal thomas a former vice president of the moral majority has repeatedly urged evangelicals to leave the political stage altogether upon the death of moral majority founder jerry falwell thomas wrote that little had been accomplished politically and much lost spiritually as many came to believe that to be a christian meant you also must be converted to the republican party and adopt the gop agenda and its tactics
8081193 pastor steve rarely preaches a straight come to jesus sermon or as he would put it presents the plan of salvation
8081194 in the three decades since i left the baptist faith in a huff the side that i had chosen that bigger world was going to win more and more victories over the minds of the western world while the evangelicals world was going to seem ore narrow rigid and angry before long people all over the country would be asking themselves what is it with those strange christians who were so hardened so obsessed with controlling other people and so intent on discriminating against people who werent doing them any harm until finally hardly anyone who wasnt an evangelical would remember that it wasnt they who had changed it was us
8081195 evangelicals saw the changes and opposed them in all the ways they could skirmishes over the power of welfare agencies to investigate child abuse over whether to spank or not spank or what children should be allowed to read in school and over whether prayer should be allowed in school masked much deeper core conflicts these core conflicts dealt with new ideas about what children need to flourish about how morality is best developed and about what kind of adults children should grow up to be
8081196 this recognition can allow other religious and nonreligious voices to be heard it can allow womens voices to be heard in spiritual settings where conservative evangelicals can never allow them acknowledging that such people also have moral ethical and spiritual wisdom that needs to be listened to would be almost impossible in a country where a quarter of the people are conservative evangelicals with ownership of moral and religious truth but we are not in that kind of country knowing that we dont live in such a country might even help those of us who feel shut out of faith to reconnect with god in ways that serve our time and place better than the old ways

8081251 senator edward m kennedy had just left a hospital bed here when he delivered his speech to the democratic national convention on monday night after suffering a his aides said that after mr kennedy finally decided he was well enough to come to denver over the weekend they became alarmed when he arrived on sunday after a long charter airplane flight accompanied by family members aides and doctors and reported being in excruciating pain their first concern was that the pain was somehow related to his cancer or the chemotherapy and radiology he had undergone and that it had been complicated by the long flight or the high altitude of the city a visit to a local hospital sunday night revealed it was kidney stones and was unrelated to his cancer mr kennedy had no previous history of kidney stones aides said
8081252 and with less than two hours to go before he was supposed to take the stage mr kennedy sitting unnoticed in a room at the university of colorado hospital told his wife victoria and doctors that he wanted to go to the pepsi center and deliver the speech he was driven there accompanied by a doctor and paramedics perched on a golf cart that took him inside mr kennedy with his wife and his niece caroline at his side walked gingerly onto the stage where he delivered a highly acclaimed address once done speaking he returned to the denver hospital where he spent the night

8081290 in four short years he has turned our country from a prosperous nation at peace into a desperately indebted nation at war but so what he is the president of the united states and youre not love it or leave it
8081291 we are turning into a nation of whimpering slaves to fear fear of war fear of poverty fear of random terrorism fear of getting down sized or fired because of the plunging economy fear of getting evicted for bad debts or suddenly getting locked up in a military detention camp on vague charges of being a terrorist sympathizer

8081359 show me your lease and by the way why didnt you think of this when you were planning this event didnt you think there would be people who would show up with signs
8081360 i didnt understand how i could get an infection from the hospital because you go there to get healed
8081361 hospital acquired infection is the dirty little secret of healthcare
8081362 copper is microbiocidal its a metal and when the bacteria come in contact with it they die
8081363 the thought of being able to reduce our infection rates by using something as simple as this is really really exciting
8081364 were looking for a 50 percent reduction and thats 15 billion
8081365 you have a one in 20 chance of developing a hospital acquired infection once you cross the threshold and enter a hospital for care
8081366 more people die of a hospital acquired infection each year in the united states than die from hiv and breast cancer combined theyre the dirty little secret of healthcare
8081367 the simple answer as to why people get infections in hospitals is that bacteria are everywhere and as best as we can we try to prevent microorganisms from coming in contact with patients yet they still do
8081368 people are people and as best we try to educate our health care workers accidents happen
8081369 we are just now rediscovering this activity that copper is antimicrobial and by placing it in close proximity to our patients we may then be able to short circuit the transfer of the microorganism from the environment to the patient
8081370 by putting metallic copper onto these surfaces we are going to reduce the concentration of indigenous microbes in the room to a level that will drop the incidence of hospital acquired infections

8081383 we have a metropolitan council that certainly isnt advocating for all seven metro counties

8081385 i think she was mistreated by the media a lot

8081388 dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8081389 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8081390 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8081391 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8081392 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8081393 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8081394 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8081395 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8081396 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8081397 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8081398 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8081399 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8081400 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8081401 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8081402 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8081403 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8081668 i live in a place in alabama where i cant get cell phone access from my house and i cant use wireless internet because we dont have broadband out in the country
8081669 edwards spoke to those issues when edwards pulled out i just kind of checked out and waited to see
8081670 that was really nice because it made us realize people actually care what were writing and want to hear from us
8081671 the room we were offered was 45 a night so we jokingly referred to it as the blogger crackhouse

8081700 jugar un grand slam s molt important i despr s de molts dies despera el primer partit per f cil que sigui el rival sempre s especial
8081701 quan he perdut el primer set va dir lespanyol he tingut la sensaci que podia guanyar i he pensat que al ser un torneig gran encara nhavia de perdre dos m s per ser eliminat sabia que tenia temps de remuntar
8081702 els aficionats han destar tranquils i confiats perqu dijous que ve serem oficialment equip de la lliga de campions
8081703 ha sigut una experi ncia inoblidable no nom s pel resultat sin sobretot pel tracte rebut i els mitjans que shan posat a disposici de lequip
8081704 no vull entrenar tan sols dos mesos a lany i prefereixo seguir en actiu durant tota la temporada
8081705 s evident que el campionat es decidir entre massa i hamilton

8081715 la seva actitud amb alguns matisos ha sigut excel lent i han intentar tot el que ens vam proposar hem eliminat un rival dentitat i encara que hem intentat que els jugadors no pensessin en el 4 0 de lanada s evident que no ho hem aconseguit del tot

8081726 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings age related macular degeneration results in reduced quality of life and increased risks of illness particularly in relation to accidents especially falls and psychological ill health
8081727 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8081728 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8081729 there is now nowhere left for pcts to hide we want them to implement nice guidance immediately rnib is also calling on hospitals to ensure they build capacity as a matter of urgency so they can save the sight of patients without further delay
8081730 at present we cannot detect differences in effects or risks although avastin may require fewer injections as it appears to last longer after each injection so the taxpayer may wish to question why they are paying so much more for lucentis when avastin appears to achieve the same outcome
8081731 we do not recognise virgins claims to be taking business from us on the grounds that passengers do not like terminal 5
8081732 against the backdrop of high oil prices and weakening consumer demand we are well placed to succeed over the coming months
8081733 in the same year british airways achieved a pre tax profit margin nearly four times higher

8081735 while the outlook remains pretty overcast for the aviation industry the winners will be those airlines that focus on offering the best customer service and which are nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead
8081736 the planning and running of elections need to be more robust and co ordinated we are still trying to run 21st century elections with 19th century structures and the system is under severe strain

8081746 the pilot relayed to the aiport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris
8081747 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8081748 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8081749 the pilot relayed to the aiport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris
8081750 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8081751 were still waiting for some god damn evidence regarding the planes physical existence
8081752 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and i guess my point at this stage is we are investigating and i think various people are speculating at what it is but weve had concerns about his behaviour and we are investigating that
8081753 we have a variety of ways we conduct investigations were comfortable with the way we are investigating that
8081754 theres a whole variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly our ethical standards department does an outstanding job
8081755 what people need to understand is that police officers do have discretion many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8081756 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8081757 people have a right to some privacy in policing while we investigate the matter
8081758 time is running out for awb to get match fit to face up to the new realities of a competitive wheat export marketing environment he said
8081759 well who knows he may be announcing some new intergalactic agreement of some kind or other you never know whats going to come out
8081760 what i would like to see him do is focus on the real economic issues
8081761 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8081762 the objective of good government is for government to raise no more money than it needs
8081763 i think its important from time to time that the prime minister take the opportunity at venues like the press club to outline and update our plans for the future
8081764 im not about to blow the lid on whats about to be said today but we have a clear agenda following on from the commitment we made at the last election
8081765 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
8081766 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
8081767 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share
8081768 if we continue to lose ice at this rate we will best
8081769 were going to lose that ice so weve got to understand what this means for the rest of us
8081770 already showing patches of open water within the ice much of the beaufort sea north of alaska is open and the laptev sea and east siberian sea have opened extensively in the past 13 days
8081771 it is very unusual to see so many bears in the open water at one time during a short flight period
8081772 its very worrisome its what we had anticipated but its happening right before our eyes
8081773 its just yet another wake up call in a long line of wake up calls to politicians in this country that says hey get your act together when it comes to global warming
8081774 current sea ice reduction is progressing at a very fast rate that appears to have no analogs in the past
8081775 sustained changes in sea ice coverage may cause perhaps the largest temperature changes observed on the planet
8081776 we knew we were vulnerable starting out in terms of ice cover

8081885 no es de fuerza mayor la transferencia de gonzalo fierro lo que me parece ins lito esta es una cadena de errores adem s de lo obtuso que fue el rbitro rub n selman cuando se le reiter que la cancha estaba mala e insisti en jugar
8081886 no there are reasons why we havent included a keyboard controller not all of our songs have keyboard parts so we didnt want someone to come into a game pick up the keyboard controller and then have nothing to do in any of the songs that are selected we wanted a big mix of music in world tour and adding a keyboard controller would either have limited our choices or the players a keyboard controller deserves to be introduced with its own game this is something were thinking about

8081907 he does it so effortlessly travis is addicted to it he loves good music but just happens to be a punk rocker
8081908 i was thinking less is more me juggling two records at the same time can be a lot for people to handle drums on top could have been too much
8081909 i hadnt heard his remixes and didnt know how amazing a drummer travis is but we got together i threw on james browns funky drummer one of the most sampled beats in hip hop and i know you got soul by bobby byrd his face would just open up he would match the beat perfectly i thought damn this is fun its like a skeleton you get to put the clothes on and once the clothes are on you yank out the spine
8081910 its awesome when youre in a band but what usually happens is you lay down the drums first then the bass then guitar then vocals damn thats like a six month to a year process
8081911 with hip hop you can make a song in a day to make beats for me is really natural so thats what i naturally migrated towards
8081912 now any remix that gets thrown to me i have to love the song enough to make a video for it
8081913 i turned down some things i dont think are me that i dont think my drums will lend a helping hand to
8081914 figuring out where there arent a lot of dynamics on a song thats one of my strengths hearing oh the verses could be closed up here or oh the choruses could be super big powerful there or whatever
8081915 who do people say that the son of man is

8081917 you are the messiah the son of the living god
8081918 blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven 18 and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it 19 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven

8081922 for the son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his father and then he will repay everyone for what has been done 28 truly i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
8081923 this is my son the beloved with whom i am well pleased
8081924 its safe and easy enough to repeat what others have said but the questions in this test are going to get much harder

8081934 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8081935 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8081936 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8081937 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8081938 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8081939 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8081940 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8081941 in fact the conspiracy would need to be even deeper than our colleagues realized

8081952 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8081953 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8081954 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8081955 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8081956 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8081957 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8081958 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8081959 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8081960 just as frank ushered in a golden era i hope this opening will mark the beginning of a resurgence in generation defining live music

8082089 it is a very serious federal crime to threaten a presidential candidate in this case however there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama
8082090 reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time and they cannot independently be corroborated
8082091 the evidence involving alleged threats does not warrant federal charges but the investigation is ongoing and we are keeping an open mind
8082092 what matters at this moment from a legal point of view the law recognises a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the racist rantings of drug users

8082114 con eso hay que andar siempre con un poco de cuidado porque el futbol es para los humildes y poco para los soberbios
8082115 la nica diferencia es que en esta primera lista llamamos a 22 jugadores porque era la primera toma de contacto pero en esta siguiente vendremos con 20 jugadores y de los 20 hay una excepci n y digo el nombre de cesc porque est pendiente de que se recupere o no y de que ma ana juegue con el arsenal y en los dem s en lo fundamental habr pocas novedades

8082134 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8082135 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had coordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8082136 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8082137 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that

8082161 if woolworths appeal to the supreme court is successful and woolworths is granted a clearance foodstuffs will also face no competition issues if it decides to purchase further shares in the warehouse

8082163 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8082164 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward

8082189 recovery is a process through which an individual is enabled to move on from their problem drug use towards a drug free life and become an active and contributing member of society
8082190 the federal government has just shrugged its shoulders and said well fix it one of these days but really theyve done nothing
8082191 it would require proof of legal presence theyd either have to be a u s citizen or be in our country legally

8082206 greatest contempt for shelfari and for what book based social networking will become if they beat out librarything
8082207 well okay not that but picture the book social network wars ending with a site created by music people who probably wouldnt get that allusion with advertising all over with community managers managing conversation between book lovers and under the shadow of what will sell books and not books other greater values in short i believe theres something to the idea of book based social networking which they dont get and to which they are a danger yes ive drunk my own kool aid
8082208 cant figure out what it all means and how it will shake out
8082209 can amazon own 100 percent of librarythings main competitor and manage its 40 percent stake in librarything without implicating itself in fiduciary responsibility conflict issues
8082210 can librarything continue to compete vigorously against shelfari when shelfari is owned by one of our investors
8082211 what can librarything do to protect itself against the possibility that amazon uses its enormous financial and technical resources to fund and promote shelfari
8082212 were excited to acquire shelfari and also pleased that when the abebooks deal closes well be a shareholder in librarything we think both companies are innovating in ways that are great for book lovers and were excited to have relationships with both
8082213 the acquisition of shelfari is completely separate from amazons acquisition of abebooks and abebooks stake in librarything
8082214 words hug used in a blog post announcing the acquisition monday night
8082215 more importantly perhaps where amazon shelfari cant follow is in the values that make librarything different openness dynamism and independence

8082258 recovery is a process characterised by voluntarily maintained control over substance use leading towards health and well being and participation in the responsibilities and benefits of society
8082259 i like the thought of well being it would seem that a complete sense of well being is hard to achieve without abstinence or receptor stability ie with methadone id like to think we have to include abstinence and perhaps add end notes about maintenance therapies
8082260 very definitely and the ukdpc definition ignores the other 11 of the 12 steps
8082261 recovery is a process where the first step is characterised by abstinence from the harmful use of mood altering chemicals followed by the engagement in a series of practical emotional and psychological steps which enable the individual to lead a full an productive life in order to reach their potential as a human being
8082262 recovery is the process of structured physical psychological and emotional rehabilitation of an individual from substance use or dependency culminating in a healthy reintegration into society

8082271 taxpayers cannot be expected to support a drug dependent lifestyle so where drug treatment is available and considered appropriate there should be an obligation that individuals take it up
8082272 interventions geared for public health and safety purposes can delay or prevent
8082273 it is imperative that we seek to answer the question of whether formal treatments such as maintenance prescribing come at a cost where long term recovery is either delayed or prevented by interventions geared for public health and public safety purposes
8082274 the advent of developmental life course theories of delinquency is perhaps the most important advance in theoretical criminology during the latter part of the 20th century
8082275 the stronger the adult ties to work and family the less crime and deviance among both delinquents and non delinquent controls
8082276 the key things that finally helped you to become abstinent
8082277 it remains a moot point whether the chronicity philosophy wedded in drug services to maintenance prescribing actually acts as a barrier to recovery in people who otherwise would gradually move closer to sustained recovery
8082278 we are seeking a declaration that klausners visual voicemail patent is invalid and that verizons system does not infringe the patent in any event
8082279 since becoming minister for community safety a year ago i have had the privilege of meeting many people working in the field
8082280 i have been struck by their commitment and hard work many of them told me that they want a new vision for tackling drug use in scotland and a great many agree about what the focus of that new vision should be
8082281 it is the job of government to capture that vision and consensus then set out what needs to be done to turn it into reality
8082282 this commitment to recovery to responding to the desire of people who use drugs to become drug free lies at the heart of this strategy
8082283 aiming for recovery means coupling common sense with aspiration pragmatism with idealism it means that public money invested in drug treatment services should have clear outcomes attached to them and it means that we must treat each person using drugs on their own terms and centre care around the person not the addiction
8082284 recovery is a process through which an individual is enabled to move on from their problem drug use towards a drug free life and become an active and contributing member of society
8082285 moving to an approach based on recovery will mean a significant change in both the pattern of services commissioned and in the way that practitioners engage with individuals the strategy sets in train actions to trun recovery into a reality core to this is reform of the way that drug services are planned commissioned and delivered to place a stronger emphasis on outcomes and on recovery
8082286 harm reduction is often made an unnecessarily controversial issue as if there were a contradiction between treatment and prevention on the one hand and reducing the adverse health and social consequences of drug use on the other this is a false dichotomy they are complementary
8082287 a process through which an individual is enabled to move on from their problem drug use towards a drug free life as an active and contributing member of society
8082288 were talking about a very serious issue here that also has huge economic implications
8082289 unfortunately we have no policy framework and there are so many agencies involved with very little coordination between them blame must be shared equally at the institutional level the engineering level and the consumer level
8082290 safety is unfortunately not a big part of the purchase decision of indian consumers
8082291 our best selling small cars are typically not the safest vehicles on the road because consumers are more worried about fuel efficiency and the cost of ownership and would rather not pay for safety features such as air bags and anti lock brakes
8082292 we do believe the need for training is becoming increasingly relevant due to the increase in vehicle volumes high speed roads enhanced performance of vehicles and the requirement of specific skills for application vehicles
8082293 as more cars are sold there is a demand for more drivers transporters also want drivers for commercial vehicles where the need for training is perhaps most acute
8082294 we are absolutely delighted to have that out of the way and we can now start to focus on getting the bank open
8082295 were aiming to have it open by the end of november and in the meantime well be hiring a bank manager
8082296 now is gone a primer on new media for executives and entrepreneurs
8082297 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8082298 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8082299 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment

8082302 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8082303 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8082304 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8082305 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8082306 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8082307 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8082308 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8082309 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8082310 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8082311 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8082312 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8082313 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8082314 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8082315 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8082316 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8082317 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8082318 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8082319 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8082320 now what do you do throw out a red handkerchief whats the format what do you do id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie
8082321 imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8082322 nobodys told us anything i think we should be schooled on it somehow
8082323 this is not going to work come on i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8082324 they get goodwill they get access and they build relationships
8082325 theyre covering all bases theyre making sure they have input with whoever wins
8082326 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8082327 what the exception says in essence is lobbyists cannot buy influence by paying for a lavish party to honor one member
8082328 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8082329 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8082330 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8082331 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8082332 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8082333 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8082334 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8082335 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8082336 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8082337 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8082338 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8082339 i know has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and john mccain for president
8082340 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8082341 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8082342 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8082343 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8082344 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8082345 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants to be president
8082346 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8082347 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8082348 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8082349 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in
8082350 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8082351 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8082352 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8082353 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8082354 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8082355 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8082356 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8082357 we have had a pretty big year all we do is concentrate on illegal abalone poaching and were very mobile so it doesnt matter where they are we can catch them
8082358 the thieves were pretty organised they had a look out to warn the divers of any fisheries personnel spotted in the area so it was pleasing we caught them
8082359 the success of recent operations sends a clear message to abalone poachers who threaten the sustainability of the abalone resource by indiscriminately harvesting juvenile abalone you will be caught
8082360 drugs are widespread in british prisons undermining any attempt to clean up prisoners from pre existing addictions greatly increasing the chances of recidivism and corrupting staff
8082361 imperial energy confirms that it is in the course of finalising the terms of a possible recommended pre conditional cash offer with ovl of 1 250 pence per imperial share a further announcement is expected later
8082362 its a beautiful location but it needs a lot of work
8082363 you walk in and its like walking into the 60s
8082364 the main thing is not to lose value in a downturn
8082365 the market determines what someone will pay for the house and if its not selling you have an issue with marketing or price
8082366 what people need to do is let go of what the perception was of their home price in the rising market and get a handle of what the real value is
8082367 i dont think theres any reason to take a property off the market for a significant length of time
8082368 if you take your house off the market for three months to put money into it i see it as a negative
8082369 as this family member was driving around they found this vehicle opened the trunk and made the discovery of the body that was in the trunk
8082370 the grandma made the stop in front of the car opened it and smelled something
8082371 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8082372 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8082373 must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8082374 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8082375 we went to see a local ugandan dance troupe ndere dance troupe which was fabulous evan you would have loved it the dancers had gorgeous costumes and balanced many different objects on their heads including enormous wooden drums and stacks of porcelain urns while dancing around rather vigorously
8082376 down here in the kern county area we have a healthy bear population
8082377 in the piute mountains as well as the greenhorn mountains it is my belief that it goes on here quite a bit it goes unnoticed
8082378 they are big trucks and carry cages for their animals and they carry propane tanks
8082379 they use propane as a chumming agent to lure the bear the bear likes the smell because it smells like rotten eggs

8082418 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8082419 it will create new pressures on the regional level throughout the caucasus and further complicates international affairs among the powers of the world
8082420 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
8082421 there is no way you can dash or cancel or

8082423 we gave them equal opportunities and jake i wouldnt have guessed when we signed wade ended up beating him out
8082424 he came out and took the job he earned it he didnt get it by default
8082425 they didnt know they could count on me to come play
8082426 that didnt surprise me i knew after getting hurt i couldnt come in and mess around this was kind of make or break
8082427 before jake got hurt he was playing well but he wasnt the same jake that we see right now hes much stronger quicker
8082428 once my body felt good that made my mind feel good

8082471 in many ways the work of a critic is easy we risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment we thrive on negative criticism which is fun to write and to read but the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so but there are times when a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and defense of the new the world is often unkind to new talent new creations the new needs friends

8082476 scenario lehman leh has been the center of attention in the last few weeks with questions swirling around of buyouts mergers more losses the ceo being kicked out you name it and it has been rumored on wall street the consensus on wall street is that lehman is in trouble but no one knows how are even how much just lots of conjecture on the part of the talking heads today we learned that lehman wants to create a separate company for the purpose of having that new company buy all of the bad paper off of lehmans books ok let me see if i got this right youre the captain of a ship and you realize that you have too much weight and it is sinking the ship so you decide to launch your life boat and put all of the dead weight into the life boat and send it on its way to survive on its own while the main ship is saved but the life boat is doomed to sink when i saw this come over the news i almost blew a gasket how ridiculous of an idea is this the company wants to avoid having to report their losses so they create an off shoot company sell the assets to them with money they will provide and putting it on the books of this new separate company and now they dont have to report the garbage is on their boat any longer but what happens to the new company well if its a private company which i suspect it would be there will be no stock to go down the drain and they only need to worry about finding a sucker er buyer to maybe buy the assets at a slight profit good luck at finding someone willing to pay more this whole thing if it plays out and becomes a reality amounts to nothing more than hiding the bad crap and being able to say they are rid of it what a joke also in the news today was a story that came over the wires that citigroup c has settled with the california attorney general on charges that the company had been stealing from their customers accounts yes you heard that right citigroup was stealing from their customers the california attorney general said the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps

8082500 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

8082568 i think having information available both anywhere without having to carry around a big book is nice

8082602 at the end of the day if you believe abortion is wrong then youve got to take seriously a political message that says were going to work to reduce that compared to a political message from the republican party thats actually not going to do that

8082671 que expedienten a la compa a y le impongan una sanci n
8082672 una de nuestras tareas es conseguir que se sientan como cualquier chico de su edad
8082673 en invierno nos hacen madrugar m s para ir a clase ahora no nos levantamos tarde y tenemos m s libertad
8082674 contamos con la experiencia positiva de que nos seguimos haciendo cargo de j venes que han cumplido los 18 a os pero siguen en el centro hasta que tengamos la certeza de que est n totalmente integrados en la sociedad herre a y en el mercado laboral
8082675 est claramente demostrado que cuando se trata de apoyar a barack obama se al las celebridades que lo respaldan no entienden de l mites en cuanto a campa as difamatorias o ataques
8082676 hubo exceso de confianza y nos falt la penetraci n del turismo peninsular a trav s de el corte ingl s
8082677 todo el mundo va a el corte ingl s lo que ellos anuncian se vende y este verano est n todas las islas menos la palma
8082678 algo que no nos sorprende cuando conocimos que en julio el turismo en el estado cay un 8 por ciento
8082679 se ha hecho notar como no pod a ser menos en la palma nos hemos mantenido igual en los ltimos veranos especialmente en visitantes de barcelona bilbao y sevilla con unos 500 turistas menos
8082680 son consideradas obras de inter s general y se incluyen en el convenio con el estado el cual estamos a la espera de que se firme desde hace cinco a os
8082681 parece que el gobierno canario y el ejecutivo central lo firmar n en el pr ximo mes de septiembre y si no es as se tienen que buscar alternativas de financiaci n porque estos proyectos deben ejecutarse de manera urgente
8082682 donde hemos tenido graves problemas este verano en relaci n al abastecimiento de agua para la agricultura
8082683 es imprescindible construir la desalinizadora de las llanadas en el municipio de los realejos para as solucionar el hist rico problema de fl or en la vertiente norte de la isla y mejorar la calidad del agua en toda esta zona
8082684 ya est el proyecto y el suelo y ahora se est buscando el sistema de financiaci n que podr a ser mixto es decir entre entidades p blicas y privadas el coste es de m s de dieciocho millones de euros
8082685 aliviar la sobre explotaci n de las aguas subterr neas porque no se puede consumir m s del acu fero de lo que se recarga que las galer as se llenen depende de la climatolog a y puede llegar un momento en el que el agua proveniente de las mismas no sea suficiente para abastecer a una poblaci n que crece
8082686 incluso esta poca de crisis econ mica nos afecta en cuanto al consumo de agua por ejemplo mucha gente que trabaja en la construcci n se ha quedado en paro y muchos regresan a depender de la econom a dom stica de sus peque as huertas y cultivos lo que implica un aumento del consumo de agua para la agricultura
8082687 que desde el ayuntamiento estamos muy interesados en que sea una empresa de la zona la que se haga cargo en especial una en concreto debido a la experiencia que tiene en este tipo de establecimientos
8082688 otros a os se compraba un 30 o un 40 de la cosecha de cada productor pero este a o no hay ning n tipo de cupo ni l mite municipal pues se adquirir toda la fruta que est en condiciones de cualquiera de los pueblos gomeros
8082689 adem s de claro est ser un complemento para la renta de los productores
8082690 la necesidad de compensar al productor as como la merma de la cosecha son
8082691 las principales razones que han llevado al cabildo a suprimir los cupos de las compras que se realizan en la bodega insular
8082692 el tiempo necesario para ponerla en marcha y adem s ajustar resultados validarlos y dem s aspectos
8082693 ampliar los elementos necesarios que sirvan para conocer la calidad del aire ambiente y adoptar si procede las medidas correctoras a que hubiese lugar al objeto de proteger la salud humana y el medio ambiente en su conjunto
8082694 esto nos permite alertar al emisor y corregir el exceso
8082695 teniendo en cuenta la libre expresi n de la voluntad de los pueblos oseta y abjaso he firmado los decretos sobre el reconocimiento por la federaci n de rusia de la independencia de osetia del sur y de la independencia de abjasia

8082697 el 8 de agosto en tiflis hicieron su opci n saakashvili eligi el genocidio para cumplir sus tareas pol ticas
8082698 las autoridades georgianas han desatado un conflicto armado cuyas v ctimas fueron civiles
8082699 apoyo al principio de la integridad territorial de georgia dentro de sus fronteras internacionalmente reconocidas
8082700 kosovo no puede servir de precedente para el reconocimiento de osetia del sur ni de ninguna otra regi n del mundo
8082701 tras un largo periodo de medidas diplom ticas y de una crisis humanitaria y una limpieza tnica provocada por el ex presidente serbio slobodan milosevic
8082702 la independencia de kosovo debe ser vista en su amplia historia y en el contexto de ruptura de la ex yugoslavia las negociaciones de paz y la presencia internacional en el territorio
8082703 plenamente los principios del derecho internacional en particular el de la integridad territorial de los estados en este caso de georgia
8082704 absolutamente coherente con la que siempre ha mantenido espa a
8082705 no contribuye a crear las condiciones necesarias para la soluci n del conflicto
8082706 the charges submitted are sufficient to warrant a hearing on the merits and a stay of the proceedings is inappropriate
8082707 conceal from or fail to disclose to the council information material to its review and approval of the settlements
8082708 ive always advocated in order to bring people in you need to bring people into your leadership hierarchy
8082709 the obama world does not work that way as a consequence that works fine for how they motivate people it does not work well in terms of how you motivate the clinton people

8082711 t has venido para que tengamos vida y vida en abundancia
8082712 he firmado los decretos sobre el reconocimiento de la federaci n rusa a la independencia de osetia del sur y de abjasia no fue una decisi n f cil de tomar pero es la nica oportunidad para salvar vidas de personas
8082713 este es un d a hist rico para nuestro pueblo estoy agradecido con la dirigencia rusa y con el pueblo ruso por el gran paso que dieron hoy de reconocer la independencia de abjasia
8082714 rusia nos ha salvado del genocidio y nos ha brindado la oportunidad de desarrollarnos y de vivir en nuestra propia tierra
8082715 la decisi n del presidente es una respuesta a esas estructuras pol ticas que dijeron que rusia necesita territorio nuevo que rusia es un ocupante que rusia va a anexarse a abjasia y a osetia del sur

8082844 above any other money saving strategy consumers use specials in store flyers to determine where they shop with the majority of consumers trying to make fewer trips to fewer stores its more important than ever for grocers to capture every possible visit
8082845 retailers with customer purchasing data from their loyalty programs can really use it to their advantage by picking the right products and providing the right incentives to attract customers to their stores versus competitors
8082846 also despite the challenging economy consumers are very reluctant to switch brands to save money thats a factor that reinforces grocers critical need to understand which brands are most important to their customers
8082847 retailers who use data from their most important customers to determine new product opportunities and to identify which brands to promote and which to give the most in store presence will have a significant advantage

8082859 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8082860 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8082861 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8082862 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8082863 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8082864 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8082865 it sounded like they didnt want him to be president
8082866 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
8082867 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
8082868 clearly we feel that there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified those agencies
8082869 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8082870 do you think they were really plotting to kill obama
8082871 i dont want to say yes i dont want to say no
8082872 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
8082873 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8082874 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target
8082875 strongly deplore the fact that this is not the first incident of this kind
8082876 that killing and maiming of civilians is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and human rights law
8082877 we do not want international forces to leave afghanistan until the time our security institutions are able to defend afghanistan independently
8082878 within the framework of afghan law with respect to international law

8082888 the strength of the show is that the audience wants to meet those 20 contestants so well spend more time with them
8082889 at one point we had neil diamond on and andrew lloyd webber and dolly parton nigel wanted to be old school but the show needs younger music
8082890 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
8082891 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
8082892 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
8082893 my agent called me and he said you are on a short list to be the 4th judge on american idol and i said are you calling for me or did you dial the wrong number they were like no seriously this is going on this can happen and i was like there is no way they are going to pick me why wouldnt they pick someone famous someone everyone knows but you know i guess they saw something about me that they thought was good and they wanted to put somebody who was from the industry on the show and so i got the job
8082894 i co wrote walk away from kelly clarkson and with kelly clarkson i co wrote the real thing for bo bice ive written with katherine mcphee and for katherine mcphee on her record clay aiken and i co wrote the way taylor hicks oh and i actually have a song now on the david archuleta cd thats coming out i think soon i co wrote with david cook
8082895 a unique experience in the sense that i sing and was a singer and i write and i produce and i sign talent and im very involved in the day to day of the music industry like simon so i think ill bring that perspective but im also very opinionated and pretty feisty and not afraid of a good confrontation so im looking forward to it bring it on
8082896 i am gonna be looking for a unique spin you know somebody who steps in front of me has something to say who has a unique look who has a great voice a unique tone isnt trying to imitate everybody else thats out there and has incredible self confidence because anybody who has ever really made it steps on that stage and they own it from the minute they step out there so i think its important that you know they really be themselves and that theyre interesting and that they keep me engaged
8082897 well i think there are a lot of things that go into being a successful artist obviously you know you have to have the right look you have to have the right sound but you have to have the right song weve seen that even in the idols some of them have been very successful and some of them havent its about that winning song you know since youve been gone was a huge song that catapulted kelly into absolute stardom so its really important that everything happen at the same time great voice great look great stage presence and a great song and all that coming together and just somebody who wants it that bad because its a lot of hard work its not easy

8082901 texaco was a great sponsor for a long time but for the last year they really have been disconnected with the sport
8082902 they have focused on other things we really didnt get much support from them the money wasnt all that great
8082903 for us it was a blessing that we can go out and find somebody who can pay us some real money
8082904 texaco was a liability for us because out of loyalty to them we werent aggressively looking to replace them
8082905 we kept hoping they maybe would wake up one of these days and decide they need to be in
8082906 the texaco management is disconnected from racing all the new people dont know what a race car looks like

8082924 para cambiar de vida una herramienta es medir y ser consciente de la huella ecol gica que provocamos existen unas tablas que nos indican los desechos que generamos en un a o seg n lo que consumimos cuanto m s ganas m s gastas y mayor impacto provocas en la tierra la segunda herramienta es la bolsa o la vida cuando registre hasta el ltimo c ntimo de lo que gasta y en qu lo gasta aprender a determinar qu cantidad de tiempo que es lo mismo que energ a vital invierte para obtener lo que consume le aseguro que a partir de ah empezar a ahorrar

8082949 today is not election day for me today is a work day for me if there are people that want to play politics with this issue ill let them play politics

8082973 the next mx 5 needs to be a big step
8082974 the last one was too conservative and we cant do another car like that we need to make it more dramatic and give it some balls
8082975 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8082976 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8082977 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8082978 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8082979 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8082980 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8082981 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8082982 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8082983 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8082984 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8082985 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8082986 this is a significant racketeering case involving alleged criminal activity spanning the globe
8082987 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
8082988 the trend is unmistakable it was not like this 10 years ago
8082989 it seems that there is something in the environment that may be causing cell transformation which leads to the development of cancer the cells of younger people are more vulnerable to toxins and they can transform to become cancerous
8082990 it has to be the electromagnetic radiation or the thermal heat thats causing the tumour
8082991 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in the health insurance from public health insurance
8082992 para m era una pesadilla ser trilliza era una carga ps quica dif cil de llevar no s lo nac siendo una pizca de 900 gramos con pocas probabilidades de sobrevivir sino que adem s estuve toda la infancia tratando de saber qui n soy esas circunstancias fueron las que me dieron el aguante la determinaci n y la energ a para todo el trabajo que me aguardaba
8082993 la dignidad el amor y la paz que v all me dejaron una impresi n imborrable mentalmente compar su muerte con la de susy el granjero hab a tenido lo que yo ahora llamo una buena muerte falleci en su casa rodeado de amor de respeto dignidad y afecto
8082994 seg n la idea de mis padres yo tendr a que haber sido una simp tica y devota ama de casa suiza pero acab siendo una tozuda psiquiatra escritora y conferenciante del suroeste de eeuu que se comunica con los esp ritus de un
8082995 comenc mi practica como residente en el hospital estatal de manhattan donde no se ten a mucho aprecio a la vida donde se albergaba a centenares de enfermos mentales muy graves
8082996 cambi las pr cticas para tratar a los pacientes como personas puso fin a los castigos mas s dicos y consigui el alta del 94 de las esquizofr nicas previamente desahuciadas no utiliz ninguna t cnica concreta sino el coraz n y el sentido com n pero el conocimiento s lo no va a sanar a nadie si no se usa la cabeza el alma y el coraz n no se puede contribuir a sanar ni a un solo ser humano
8082997 se les pon a en las habitaciones m s alejadas de los puestos de enfermeras se les obligaba a permanecer acostados bajo fuertes luces que no pod an apagar no pod an recibir visitas fuera de las horas prescritas
8082998 mi trabajo con las enfermas esquizofr nicas me hab a ense ado que existe un poder sanador que trasciende los medicamentos que trasciende la ciencia y eso es lo que yo llevaba cada d a a las salas del hospital durante mis visitas a los enfermos me sentaba en las camas les cog a las manos y hablaba durante horas con ellos as aprend que no hay ni un solo moribundo que no anhele cari o contacto o comunicaci n los moribundos no desean ese distanciamiento sin riesgos que practican los m dicos ans an sinceridad
8082999 la mayor a de los m dicos se mostraban demasiado distanciados en su trato con los pacientes necesitaban tratar a los pacientes como seres humanos iguales que ellos
8083000 mi meta era romper con la barrera de negaci n profesional que prohib a a los pacientes expresar sus m s ntimas preocupaciones
8083001 estar sentado en la cabecera de un moribundo es un regalo nuestro mejor maestro de ah saldremos m s enteros m s enriquecidos
8083002 he aprendido a no juzgar por lo general si un enfermo ha aceptado la muerte y el proceso de morir puede esperar a que llegue naturalmente entonces la muerte es una experiencia hermosa y trascendental al suicidarse la persona podr a perderse la lecci n que debe aprender en ese caso en lugar de aprobar y pasar al curso siguiente tendr que volver a aprender la lecci n anterior desde el comienzo
8083003 no s lo creo que hay una vida despu s de la muerte sino que lo s tenemos datos suficientes verificables y es importante compartir este conocimiento con la gente
8083004 observ que poco antes de morir los enfermos se relajaban incluso los que se hab an rebelado contra la muerte otros al acercarse su final parec an tener experiencias muy claras con seres queridos ya muertos y hablaban con personas a las que yo no ve a pr cticamente en todos los casos la muerte ven a precedida por una singular serenidad
8083005 morir es trasladarse a una casa m s bella se trata sencillamente de abandonar el cuerpo f sico como una mariposa abandona su capullo de seda
8083006 millones de flores de loto de una belleza incre ble
8083007 fue la sensaci n de xtasis mas maravillosa que un ser humano puede experimentar me sent a invadida por un respeto reverencial hacia todo lo que me rodeaba y de amor por todo lo que vive
8083008 yo sab a que el sida era la batalla m s importante a la que yo y tal vez el mundo nos enfrent bamos desde la polonia de la posguerra la victoria definitiva de esta enfermedad depender a de algo m s que de la ciencia
8083009 la muerte es una experiencia maravillosa y positiva pero el proceso de morir cuando se prolonga como el m o es una pesadilla nos mina las facultades sobre todo la paciencia la resistencia y la ecuanimidad
8083010 a pesar de todo mi sufrimiento continuo oponi ndome a kevorkian que quita prematuramente la vida a las personas por el simple motivo de que sufren mucho dolor o molestias no comprenden que al hacerlo impide que las personas aprendan las lecciones que necesitan aprender antes de marcharse en estos momentos estoy aprendiendo la paciencia y la sumision
8083011 la medicina tiene sus l mites realidad que no se ense a en la facultad otra realidad que no se ense a es que un coraz n compasivo puede sanar casi todo unos cuantos meses en el campo me convencieron de que ser buen m dico no tiene nada que ver con anatom a cirug a ni con recetar los medicamentos correctos el mejor servicio que un m dico puede prestar a un enfermo es ser una persona amable atenta cari osa y sensible
8083012 creo que la medicina moderna se ha convertido en una especie de profeta que ofrece una vida sin dolor eso es una tonter a lo nico que a mi juicio sana verdaderamente es el amor incondicional
8083013 hab a una poca en que la medicina consist a en sanar no hacer negocio
8083014 los directores de las grandes compa as de seguros y de la oms ganan millones de d lares al a o mientras que los enfermos de sida no pueden costearse los medicamento
8083015 los ni os moribundos mucho m s que los adultos dicen exactamente lo que necesitan para estar en paz la mayor dificultad est en escucharlos y hacerles caso
8083016 de forma similar a los adultos los ni os dejan sus cuerpos f sicos igual que la mariposa sale del capullo y pasan por las diferentes fases de vida despu s de la muerte
8083017 porque stos no han hecho su trabajo y han tenido sobradas oportunidades durante los ltimos 2000 mil a os
8083018 no es necesario tener un gur ni un consejero para crecer los maestros se presentan en todas las formas y con toda clase de disfraces los ni os los enfermos terminales
8083019 mis pacientes moribundos me ense aron mucho m s que lo que es morirse
8083020 no atreverte puede ser mucho m s da ino que atreverte y equivocarte esto ltimo al menos les da a los dem s algo que perdonar lo primero no les da nada
8083021 siempre me preguntan c mo es la muerte contesto que es maravillosa es lo m s f cil que vamos a hacer jam s la vida es ardua la vida es lucha la vida es como ir a la escuela recibimos muchas lecciones cuanto m s aprendemos m s dif ciles se vuelven las lecciones cuando se aprende la lecci n el dolor desaparece
8083022 la vida acaba cuando hemos aprendido todo lo que tenemos que aprender
8083023 durante 81 a os solo hab a dado amor cobijo y afecto
8083024 si cubri semos los desfiladeros para protegerlos de los vendavales jam s ver amos la belleza de sus formas
8083025 todas las penurias que se sufren en la vida todas las tribulaciones y pesadillas todas las cosas que podr amos considerar castigos de dios son en realidad regalos
8083026 el mejor regalo que nos ha hecho dios es el libre albedrio la libertad
8083027 las personas m s hermosas que he encontrado son aquellas que han conocido la derrota el sufrimiento la lucha y la perdida y hallado su camino desde las profundidades estas personas tienen una apreciaci n una sensibilidad y una comprensi n de la vida que los llena de compasi n amabilidad y solidaridad
8083028 cada persona elige si sale de las dificultades aplastada o perfeccionada
8083029 yo digo que para llevar una buena vida y as tener una buena muerte hemos de tomar nuestras decisiones teniendo como objetivo el amor incondicional y pregunt ndonos
8083030 cada uno de los miles de pacientes con quienes coment sus experiencias de muerte cl nica temporal recordaba haber entrado en la luz y o do cu nto amor has sido capaz de dar y recibir cu nto servicio has prestado es decir se les preguntaba c mo hab an asimilado la lecci n m s dif cil de la vida el amor incondicional
8083031 las mayores satisfacciones en la vida provienen de abrir el coraz n a las personas necesitadas la mayor felicidad consiste en ayudar a los dem s
8083032 en todo momento debemos escoger entre varias posibilidades en lo que decimos hacemos y pensamos
8083033 no se puede contar con el futuro la vida est en el presente hay que vivir cada d a como si fuera el ltimo
8083034 ning n ni o nace tan defectuoso que dios no le dote con alg n don especial nada est garantizado en la vida fuera de que todo el mundo tiene que enfrentarse a dificultades as es como aprendemos algunos se enfrentan a dificultades desde el momento en el que nacen esas son las personas mas especiales de todas que necesitan el mayor cari o atenci n y comprensi n y nos recuerdan que la nica finalidad de la vida es el amor
8083035 no se puede sanar el mundo sin primero sanarse a uno mismo
8083036 si estamos dispuestos para las experiencias espirituales y no tenemos miedo las tendremos sin necesidad de un gur o un maestro que nos diga c mo hacerlo
8083037 cuando nacimos de la fuente a la que yo llamo dios fuimos dotados de una faceta de divinidad eso es lo que nos da el conocimiento de nuestra divinidad todos somos amados con un amor que trasciende la comprensi n todos somos bendecidos y guiados
8083038 realmente creo que mi verdad es una verdad universal que est por encima de cualquier religi n situaci n econ mica raza o color y que la compartimos todos en la experiencia normal de la vida
8083039 hago lo que me parece correcto no lo que se espera de mi
8083040 no somos inermes part culas de polvo llevadas por el viento somos todos como hermosos copos de nieve nicos y nacidos con un prop sito espec fico
8083041 las personas son como vidrieras brillan y relucen cuando hay sol pero cuando se hace la oscuridad su verdadera belleza se puede apreciar nicamente si hay una luz que proviene del interior
8083042 cuando hemos aprobado los ex menes de lo que vinimos a aprender a la tierra se nos permite graduarnos se nos permite desprendernos del cuerpo que aprisiona nuestra alma como el capullo envuelve a la futura mariposa y cuando llega el momento oportuno podemos abandonarlo entonces estaremos libres de dolores de temores y preocupaciones tan libres como una hermosa mariposa que vuelve a casa a dios que es un lugar donde jam s estaremos solos donde continuaremos creciendo espiritualmente donde estamos con nuestros seres queridos y rodeados de un amor que es imposible imaginar
8083043 la muerte es s lo una transici n de esta vida a otra existencia en la cual ya no hay dolor ni angustia
8083044 es muy importante que hagas lo que de verdad te importa s lo as podr s bendecir la vida cuando la muerte est cerca
8083045 vive de tal forma que al mirar hacia atr s
8083046 cada persona elige si sale de las dificultades aplastada o perfeccionada
8083047 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8083048 this is a day of mourning for us its a sad day because we have a big economic problem if we had good lives every day would be a happy day for us but the way we are living right now every moment is sad
8083049 we are gathering together we have mobilised this huge number of people to make a call to our government to address the issues of slum dwellers to give them access to water to give them access to sanitation and better living conditions
8083050 by participating in this project we can show everybody that we are not just keeping silent and we are not just accepting what is happening in our society
8083051 countries such as ours signed a charter at the un in 2000 that by 2015 education will reach every home health and clean drinking water will be available to everyone and that environmental pollution will come to an end eighteen countries in the world signed this charter
8083052 i urge therefore the increase of efforts to eliminate the causes of poverty and the tragic consequences that result from it

8083088 if it were to come out that in fact owens glenn account is the accurate account that is winston peters approached owen glenn for the money when you add that with the fact winston denied it very very publicly i think he cant stay as foreign minister at that point
8083089 these are incredibly important issues for our democracy the public have got a right to be reassured about the influence of money over politics and so i am hopeful the privileges committee can get to the bottom of it
8083090 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand
8083091 winstons in a spot now where the whole world is wrong and only winston is right im afraid its winston peters credibility that has been shot to bits
8083092 i would like to think that new zealand first would put the national interest ahead of any other issues
8083093 i know that the lessons that al maliki has taken from history are on his mind
8083094 i think maliki understands that no legitimate iraqi prime minister can accept any foreign presence in iraq history makes that perfectly clear
8083095 this agreement will be the test for the current government
8083096 we supported al maliki in what he achieved for iraq until now but none of that will count for him if this agreement does not ensure full independence and sovereignty for iraq
8083097 unless he manages to restore real iraqi sovereignty he wont be able to survive as prime minister
8083098 i cant imagine he wants to be remembered as someone like that

8083113 to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wished to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the pangs of despised love the laws delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action

8083127 the geographical overlap between regions of opium and zones of insurgency shows the inextricable link between drugs and conflict
8083128 since drugs and the insurgency are caused by and effect each other they need to be dealt with at the same time and urgently
8083129 member states have yet to demonstrate willingness to comply with the security councils decisions for example by seeking extradition of the criminals who sow death among their youth
8083130 in helmand for example we did not have proper force protection
8083131 that decision is being taken now because the planting season is in october and this is where my worries come in
8083132 i hope this decline in cultivation will be a trend but i would rather see it as a golden opportunity for the government and the international community to go in with massive investment in agriculture and rural development in a much more concerted way than they have done before to those areas which are poppy free or close to poppy free
8083133 they can last for the rest of the year but next year if they dont see that somebody will come to their rescue they could go back to growing opium

8083135 they bring a lot of heavy weapons and heavy logistical support from other areas in order to enter the camp to destroy the camp and to kill civilians this is the strategy of omar al bashir since he came from turkey he said that he wants to confront the international community he wants to wipe all the camps from the map in darfur
8083136 according to our people on the ground they have seen 11 bodies in unconfirmed reports the number of dead persons was higher than that number such reports will be confirmed by unamid today
8083137 we are concerned about what is going on of course and we are engaging the government of south darfur it is not the first time that these kind of events took place last year it was an almost similar scenario so we have to come out with a lasting solution and as a matter of fact the government of south darfur asked us to organize a meeting with idp representatives and representatives from international ngos to find a solution to this tension which is prevailing in this big and huge camp since a long time
8083138 we are very very very astonished by the failure of the unamid forces
8083139 they came to protect civilians and now they let civilians be killed by the khartoum government
8083140 in depth analysis and up to the minute coverage of game changing developments
8083141 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8083142 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility

8083153 i would say some people thought we were going to die
8083154 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping
8083155 i sent my mum a text i love you and i am going down
8083156 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
8083157 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
8083158 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew deploy their oxygen masks and they cant be making pa announcements while they have their oxygen masks on
8083159 one thing that can happen is that the outflow valve can fail and become open so all the air rushes out
8083160 a hole can appear because some damage was done which nobody notices and because of the constant stress of pressurising and depressurising the cabin it becomes bigger over time
8083161 what we had in these cases was jet jockeys deciding i am better than ryanair sops standard operating procedures we dont want anybody doing that

8083176 the doctors of the catholic church have not been able to make that definition

8083242 lets be blunt about it some new zealanders will die unnecessarily as a result of this decision
8083243 police are able to draw firearms when they are needed
8083244 the big gap in our tactical options is a less than lethal option that will reliably incapacitate a dangerous offender
8083245 issuing tasers to every primary response police officer would make a real difference to the safety of police the public and even offenders themselves
8083246 it is a reflection of the increasingly serious violence that is being witnessed daily by police and public alike
8083247 however our own survey of police association members in 2005 did not indicate a desire amongst most police to be regularly armed with firearms
8083248 police today are almost more afraid of having to use lethal force than they are of being subjected to it

8083252 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
8083253 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
8083254 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
8083255 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
8083256 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
8083257 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
8083258 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety

8083260 fibrosis is a disease of many organs lungs kidneys pancreas prostate skin
8083261 its possible this mechanism in the liver is relevant to fibrotic situations in other tissues
8083262 once a lot of extracellular matrix has formed its very hard to clear
8083263 the material just sits there and creates an inflammatory environment
8083264 we suggest that following tissue damage hepatic stellate cells become activated and proliferate intensely senesce and are eventually cleared to protect the liver from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury
8083265 however in response to chronic tissue damage for example as produced by viral hepatitis or fatty liver disease continual rounds of hepatocyte i
8083266 our results show that at least for urinary tract infections cranberry juice targets the right bacteria those that cause disease but has no effect on non pathogenic organisms suggesting that cranberry juice will not disrupt bacteria that are part of the normal flora in the gut
8083267 we have also shown that this effect occurs at concentrations of cranberry juice that are comparable to levels we would expect to find in the urinary tract
8083268 when we takes e coli bacteria that have been treated with cranberry juice and place them in normal growth media they regain the ability to adhere to urinary tract cells
8083269 this suggests that to realize the antibacterial benefits of cranberry one must consume cranberry juice regularly perhaps daily

8083277 were really fed up with being treated like second class citizens
8083278 its their homes and council has a community service obligation and honours that
8083279 the feedback im getting from other people to deal with this is were going over and above in our community service obligation
8083280 i think it will be a bit of a think tank for council information and concerns in relation to the development
8083281 id like to think people will put positives on the table as well
8083282 its a fantastic not only for turner caravan park but for augusta
8083283 were providing as much information to the community as we possibly can
8083284 its a community proposal on a community asset and the permanent residents are community ratepayers
8083285 the permanent residents fear they will be kicked out tomorrow and we want to allay those fears
8083286 no decision has been made by council and until a decision has been made its still only speculation
8083287 then it will be put to council and council will make a decision
8083288 the permanent residents will not be asked to leave the caravan park
8083289 the shire is looking at options to provide them with suitable alternatives within the park and will be seeking their feedback on those options in the very short term

8083297 like all councils we were passionate energetic and tried to represent the community as best we could
8083298 we created the east margaret river structure plan for a route set in council
8083299 we pushed for that very hard harder than this council but i cant criticise this council for the ministers mantra for land to help the government fund it
8083300 the busselton jetty and the augusta marina are two other examples that are and will suffer in the same way
8083301 our council tried to get it by kicking and screaming and this council is trying to embrace it
8083302 we wanted to shame the department into getting it funded
8083303 i think its the role of council to do that
8083304 i think what barry house needs to do is give a commitment on behalf of the liberal party that if they gain government in two weeks time they will fully fund a perimeter road in margaret river
8083305 i was directly involved prior to the change of government in 2001 in negotiating with the shire and main roads department
8083306 all of that seemed to fall in a heap after 2001
8083307 it has been for a decade one of the most important issues regarding margaret rivers future and it gets more critical every day
8083308 the investigations found that all the mis are either insolvent on a cash flow basis a balance sheet basis or on the basis of the accounts kept by pwl have no assets or liabilities
8083309 further mis involving the growing of grapes would require members to pay more funds than they are likely to receive in revenue for the remainder of those mis
8083310 as a result none of the mis have the working capital required to continue to operate and the administrators are not aware of anyone who would be willing to contribute sufficient working capital to resolve the situation
8083311 we consider the prospects for finding such a replacement to be very low
8083312 we are the first regional shire to be involved in this type of initiative which is very exciting so we hope that the community responds to our call for assistance
8083313 this is a great opportunity for local seniors and those supporting seniors to have a say about how age friendly we are across a variety of key areas and generate some positive ideas of ways we can become more aged friendly into the future
8083314 for those people wanting to participate but preferring not to be involved in the groups there is limited capacity to have a say via one on one interviews or by simply completing a survey

8083322 its ironic that just as regulators are breaking up one monopoly baa british airways and american airlines are trying to create another our results prove that consumers want choice on transatlantic routes unless the regulators block the proposed ba aa monopoly consumers will lose out and theyll pay higher ticket prices for the privilege
8083323 while the outlook remains pretty overcast for the aviation industry the winners will be those airlines that focus on offering the best customer service and which are nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead our strategy of slowing our growth has paid off in time for the slowdown in the industry against the backdrop of high oil prices and weakening consumer demand we are well placed to succeed over the coming months we have diversified our route network focused on providing the best product in upper class premium economy and economy hedged our fuel purchasing and built up a strong cash position

8083380 at our best its not your lineage or last name that matters its not where you come from that counts its where you want to go in america everyone should get a fair shot barack obama understands this because hes lived it and barack obama is running to restore that fair shot for every american
8083381 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans you know i spent 20 years in business if you ran a company whose only strategy was to tear down the competition it wouldnt last long so why is this wisdom so hard to find in washington
8083382 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an
8083383 as governor of virginia it was humbling to occupy a position that was once held by thomas jefferson almost as daunting as delivering the keynote speech four years after barack obama or speaking before hillary clinton
8083384 towards the end of his life thomas jefferson the founder of our party wrote one of his frequent letters to his old rival john adams
8083385 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8083386 jefferson got it right at the dawn of the 19th century and its our challenge to get it right at the dawn of the 21st this race is all about the future thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8083387 wait no i think i found them no shit thats a yeast infection thing

8083395 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8083396 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8083397 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8083398 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8083399 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8083400 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8083401 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8083402 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8083403 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8083404 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8083405 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8083406 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8083407 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it

8083416 support morally coercive or discriminatory practices or policies in violation of federal law
8083417 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
8083418 the proposed definition of abortion is so broad that it would cover many types of birth control including oral contraceptives and emergency contraception
8083419 we worry that under the proposal contraceptive services would become less available to low income and uninsured women
8083420 why on earth is the bush administration trying to discourage doctors and clinics from providing contraception to women who need it
8083421 we dont normally comment on whether we are considering changes in regulations
8083422 it is absolutely a requirement for this matter to be open for this matter to be addressed and this matter to be resolved
8083423 this school is very concerned to ensure that children are treated well and that their interests are protected
8083424 if theres anyone out there that is currently concerned they may be the subject of this particular investigation they are urged to come forward in the strictest confidence and contact crimestoppers
8083425 these allegations happened some 20 odd years ago there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that the college involved is has been looking to anything in the current day
8083426 we realised later we missed the chance of course we are angry
8083427 we are decent and treat them well so we left we are not paparazzi

8083430 they have been urging us to recognize them for years now so there was a remarkable patience on display from the russian federation
8083431 it has no impact on the internationally established borders of georgia and will not change in any way the international communitys stand on the sovereignty territorial integrity and independence of georgia
8083432 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
8083433 we share the same common goal as the iraqi government and that is to turn over more and more of the security responsibilities to the iraqi security forces
8083434 thats proceeding well but at the end of the day nothing changes from the fact that we believe strongly that the withdrawal of u s forces of coalition forces ought to be based on the conditions on the ground and what we are seeing is a dramatically improved situation in iraq with respect to security and an ever increasingly capable iraqi security force
8083435 he was not a blackberry kind of guy said his younger brother joshua goldman a 32 year old hybrid city bus engineer from san diego
8083436 man of la mancha his family said they remembered him at the camping trip he organized for his four brothers strumming a mandolin and singing as they paddled three weeks before his death down the potomac river this was near where he had been born and raised in potomac md goldmans father was nuclear physicist for the u s government from him benjamin got his chin dimple and his probing disciplined intellect his mother was a lover of philosophy henry james and the grand ole opry from her her son inherited his passionate love of music goldman met his wife when they were teenagers at a jewish summer camp they fell in love as counselors after a year in israel on a kibbutz he learned hebrew and wrote a song for his new love called dance lonni dance
8083437 ben had a gift for seeing things the way few of us could said paul mcnab vice president of marketing and corporate marketing organization for cisco
8083438 every problem was an opportunity every roadblock a chance to shine every discouragement a possibility to improve
8083439 for the next 2 hours we went whooping and hollering through the corridors of the pentagon fast i mean fast said his brother michael an allergist from maryland
8083440 youre not allowed to go roller blading in the pentagon
8083441 im sorry i didnt know you couldnt go roller blading here
8083442 that might very well be a wise strategy from an environmental point of view and then we can talk about instead of using it for energy purposes we can talk about avoided deforestation because then you can use these trees instead of cutting down other trees and that is the idea here
8083443 but under the current kyoto protocol you cannot claim carbon credits for doing such a thing because claiming avoided deforestation is not a part of the kyoto protocol
8083444 it could very well be that after 2012 the regime will be different and you will then get a regime where you claim such carbon credits
8083445 this is a very very hot issue in the negotiations on what kind of protocol we will get after 2012
8083446 in three years afghanistan has gone from 82 percent of the provinces growing poppy to approximately 60 percent of the provinces being poppy free
8083447 at this point in time i would like to ask nato and isaf to concentrate on these three very physical targets targets in the hands of either insurgents or criminal groups
8083448 and therefore not attacking the farmers but attacking those who provide the opportunity for farmers to cultivate opium
8083449 if youve got 882 clinics you have 1 billion a year in annual revenue and 330 million of that comes from taxpayer funding i think that shows pretty clearly they are big business they are the wal mart of big abortion theyre the big box retailer
8083450 it is time to end their tax exempt status its a fraud and its time to stop the public financing of planned parenthood its the right thing to do
8083451 planned parenthood does more in one day to prevent unintended pregnancy and the need for abortion than politicians like michele bachmann do in a lifetime
8083452 in spite of what michelle bachmann says planned parenthood served nearly 65 000 people last year
8083453 what this means is that more minnesotans than ever are in need of health care services and ppmns is the safety net health care provider they turn to for the care they need nearly 76 percent of ppmns patients are very low income and likely to qualify for public insurance programs
8083454 well let me tell you theyve made a decision planned parenthood that they are going to go after the affluent how do i know that its happening in my district and it was detailed in this article
8083455 it said three express centers opening in wealthy minnesota suburbs and shopping centers and malls places where women are already doing their grocery shopping picking up their starbucks living their daily lives
8083456 do we understand what this is this is to promote women to promote that woman intentionally take the lives of their unborn children
8083457 we are asking god fearing americans to subsidize this brutal and bloody procedure on a regular business in upscale shopping malls all across the united states
8083458 i was just outraged that congress would want to substitute its judgment for the judgment of the american people
8083459 it struck me as a massive big brother intrusion into our homes and our lives
8083460 the archbishop has repeatedly apologised to victims of sexual abuse by members of the church and today i repeat that apology to the victims in this case
8083461 these numbers are not surprising to anyone who works in this field but they are alarming
8083462 its a pretty big jump and its something were seeing nationwide
8083463 something fairly standardized that sends the same message to youth is a good idea
8083464 if i ever hear ian healy or someone say sledging has been going on forever im going to refer him to the video of the invincibles there wasnt a word out of place for the whole tour
8083465 if bradman could come back today and see whats happening in the game of cricket i think hed be terribly disappointed
8083466 when i heard about ricky ponting delivering the bradman oration i thought to myself dear oh dear oh well thats the way they do things these days
8083467 i heard ponting being interviewed on the wireless one day it was after the india test at the sydney cricket ground where they disgraced themselves and all that baloney and i heard him say no im not going to tell my players what they can say
8083468 i thought god strike me that would be the equivalent of field marshal montgomery calling his colonels together on the night before the battle of el alamein well boys weve got rommel tomorrow at el alamein do it your way and ill see you at the finish
8083469 people have been a little bit askance about bradman they talk of him being unapproachable and so forth it wasnt the case
8083470 im certain i never queried him on it but he wouldnt say to a player later on when he was a selector look billy i think youre not travelling well it might be because of so and so that wasnt his go
8083471 but all you had to do was say can you help me hed bend over backwards then
8083472 knowledge of and an ability to perform first aid procedures
8083473 to ensure an appropriate balance between student safety and their right to engage in gymnastic activities
8083474 the schools highest priority remains the safety and well being of its students
8083475 the decision to restrict unsupervised cart wheels and hand stands was taken in the interests of the safety of all students as well as in recognition of the schools physical environment
8083476 the message is clear we in permatang pauh and in malaysia we demand change for freedom and justice
8083477 we want an independent judiciary we want the economy to benefit the vast majority not the corrupt few
8083478 i think he feels he has to ride the momentum and given what he has experienced over the past few weeks he will be more convinced than ever that he has to do that
8083479 i would at least say that he has a vision of what the future economy should look like he has a roadmap
8083480 given the paucity of ideas in bn anwar comes across as an appealing leader with the experience to boot
8083481 i thought that people would vote get their problems solved but they seemed more attracted to propaganda promises and innuendo from the opposition
8083482 the bn has been rattled enough by the march 8 elections some parties in the ruling coalition have been threatening to quit the bn talk of defections may turn to reality now
8083483 gives a group of teen couples the chance to care for real children to demonstrate to them and the word that they arent prepared for parenthood
8083484 cant we all agree that teens being pregnant stinks regardless of our position on abortion
8083485 this is what sends them running to the condom aisle
8083486 how dare you try to tell me how to raise my kid
8083487 i want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments
8083488 if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul if you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy
8083489 extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
8083490 to date actions have been taken to reduce the groups annual employee costs by 14 per cent

8083500 if you are facing uncertain global economic times ahead the worst thing you can do is send a message of uncertainty to the international economic and financial community about whether this governments budget is going to pass the parliament and whether its surplus is going to remain intact
8083501 seeking to undermine the governments efforts to assist the reserve bank in the struggle to keep interest rates as low as possible
8083502 i do not really know any more who takes the decisions over on their side of the house
8083503 were not going to block the budget its not a 1975 situation with the whitlam government
8083504 a defining moment in terms of the trade union movement and the labor party
8083505 prevent the worst possible future uses of the abccs powers
8083506 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8083507 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8083508 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8083518 improving patient outcomes and reducing cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications
8083519 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8083520 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8083521 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8083522 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8083523 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8083524 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8083525 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8083526 they were concentrating on the more severe forms of the condition but we felt it was important to get this information out there
8083527 with all other diabetes medications we know there has been pancreatitis and some of those people have died
8083528 i die on every dive but i have a time machine that wont tell me what i did wrong so i plan
8083529 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8083530 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8083531 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8083532 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8083533 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8083534 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8083535 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8083536 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8083537 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8083538 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8083539 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8083540 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8083541 who are open to doing something on the production side
8083542 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8083543 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8083544 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8083545 one is from a licensing standpoint is the home appropriately licensed and should it continue to be licensed
8083546 and then they pile other food on top of that food and then they put some sauce on it and then theres some more food on top of that
8083547 i dont ask you to change why cant you accept me for who i am
8083548 i am who i am and who i was when you came into my life so dont try to change me
8083549 yeah well you did it to yourself just like the other twenty times
8083550 i would have loved to have the choice that comes from having men immediately want to be around me because i was so pretty to make excuses for me because i was so pretty to fall in love with me because i was so pretty they couldnt take their eyes off of me
8083551 things work out exactly the way they are suppose to
8083552 no catholic no evangelical can ethically vote obama and biden because they support legalized child killing by abortion
8083553 every christian voter needs to see obama and biden for what they are the most strident supporters of child killing ever seen in a presidential race
8083554 abortion is murder and no faithful christian catholic or protestant can vote for obama its that simple
8083555 let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream
8083556 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8083557 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8083558 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8083559 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8083560 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8083561 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8083562 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8083563 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8083564 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8083565 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8083566 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8083567 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8083568 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8083569 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8083570 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8083571 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8083572 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8083573 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8083574 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8083575 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8083576 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8083577 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8083578 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8083579 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8083580 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8083581 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8083582 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8083583 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8083584 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8083585 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8083586 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8083587 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8083588 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8083589 produce agency records concerning documentation revealing the process by which wreckage recovered by defendant from the aircraft used during the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 was positively identified by defendant with the aid of the national transportation safety board as belonging to the said aircraft presumably through the use of unique serial number identifying information contained by the said aircraft wreckage that was collected by defendant and which defendant has improperly withheld from plaintiff
8083590 we have a large audience worldwide but when we saw what was happening in australia that was the reason we wanted to take a trip out here and open an office so that we could provide the same level of customer support in north america to grow an audience down here
8083591 from a customer service standpoint in terms of promptness of emails being returned or the ability to call a local office in your own time zone we felt it was an important part of taking care of the parents and taking care of the kids
8083592 a few of us were working at a web development company and we started talking about our kids and what we think might be a great environment for them online
8083593 one thing led to another and we decided to give this thing a go without knowing if it would be sustainable let alone turn into a business like this
8083594 it really came from a parents perspective and obviously weve worked hard to maintain that
8083595 we built a lot of the technology that helps keep the virtual world safe but we dont rely on technology alone
8083596 the human element is important and its one of the reasons why two thirds of our staff are made up of safety personnel and moderators
8083597 we took a bold move in the beginning when everyone on the internet was funded through advertising
8083598 some of the younger users usually arent able to distinguish between whats an ad and whats a game
8083599 we wanted to make sure that we kept all of that away from it
8083600 we have a self contained area so parents know their children wont be linking out of or clicking through to other areas of the web
8083601 the overwhelming majority of our e books are stored and read on computer screens
8083602 hand held devices such as mobile phones and pdas are a small percentage of what we do and of course e book readers such as the sony e reader or the irex iliad are small but rapidly growing segments for us
8083603 for the current generation of readers its going to be hard but generation x and generation y are used to reading from screens and should take to the technology
8083604 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8083605 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8083606 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the
8083607 the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form
8083608 that the abortion will terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
8083609 we remain optimistic that in time the court will find that the law is unconstitutional
8083610 i also like to draw attention to the emotional and psychological implications of telling women that abortions could cause emotional stress i find that we as human beings make a big deal out of what society tells us should be a big deal its all about perspective and this law is essentially telling women that abortions should have the effect of making you depressed if youre not depressed youre uncaring its like one big punishment from the government for women choosing to have an abortion
8083611 the life of a whole separate unique living human being
8083612 so long as the provider puts this legislatively mandated language at the bottom of the hippa form for the patient to sign frankly i dont think it will make one darn bit of difference in real life
8083613 this is the second time in less than two years that we have seen a massive computer failure that has grounded thousands of flights across the country ensuring that passengers are kept flying safely and efficiently should be one of our nations top priorities how many times do we have to see these type of total system break downs before our government steps in to do something
8083614 congress has made great strides in coming up with an faa reauthorization bill that would upgrade this antiquated technology and ensure passengers basic rights but now we need to finish the job before financing expires on september 30th and we have to start all over from scratch we urge lawmakers to pass this important legislation and ensure that passengers everywhere have access to basic rights and recourses when traveling
8083615 this most recent failure of the faa computer system has effected every flight and every airport in the country today obviates the need for congress to stop kicking the can down the road and pass the faa modernization bill now before congress the faa reauthorization bill has already been delayed one year and now congress still has not finished the job through the senate will it take a catastrophic event before congress shores up our infrastructure in a meaningful way
8083616 a range of options in relation to its remaining african assets
8083617 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
8083618 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8083619 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8083620 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8083621 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8083622 if we continue to lose ice at this rate we will best
8083623 were going to lose that ice so weve got to understand what this means for the rest of us
8083624 already showing patches of open water within the ice much of the beaufort sea north of alaska is open and the laptev sea and east siberian sea have opened extensively in the past 13 days
8083625 it is very unusual to see so many bears in the open water at one time during a short flight period
8083626 its very worrisome its what we had anticipated but its happening right before our eyes
8083627 its just yet another wake up call in a long line of wake up calls to politicians in this country that says hey get your act together when it comes to global warming
8083628 current sea ice reduction is progressing at a very fast rate that appears to have no analogs in the past
8083629 sustained changes in sea ice coverage may cause perhaps the largest temperature changes observed on the planet
8083630 we knew we were vulnerable starting out in terms of ice cover
8083631 it will help us crack the mysteries of these enormously powerful emissions
8083632 we dont yet understand the mechanism for how the particles that emit the gamma rays are accelerated
8083633 were not even sure what the nature of the particles are

8083641 that the state consider a change in policy that would allow expanded oil exploration and extraction in our county
8083642 since the traumatic oil spill in 1969 significant technological improvements on methods of extraction have been made which should appreciably mitigate such spills from happening in the future

8083646 theres some studies that show that some herbs have a very promising anti diabetic effect anti high blood pressure effect a cholesterol lowering effect
8083647 in ayurveda and all those traditional systems there certainly are some promising wisdom and heritage that we need to harvest but the key thing is we need to separate out whats helpful and what needs to be looked at and perhaps set aside

8083666 however whenever i unplug the sata cable from one of the drives to simulate a catastrophic drive failure while doing moderate reading from the zpool such as streaming hd video not only does the video hang on the remote machine which is accessing the zpool via nfs but the server running opensolaris seems to either hang or become incredibly unresponsive

8083669 we were all laughing so hard in the office its a lesson on why we have this show in the first place
8083670 i certainly hope this is not the pinnacle but things are certainly the best theyve ever been for me
8083671 it seems like all my ducks are going in the right direction i just hope they dont drink too much grey goose on the way like their owner
8083672 for other people it may be awkward but its certainly not for us

8083679 everybody knows who tori spelling is because no one else has a face like that
8083680 in theory a snarky nightly half hour devoted to entertainment culture makes considerable sense for e
8083681 but in chelsea lately the network has gotten the idea right and the talent wrong a kathy griffin with a grating voice that could curve the spine comic chelsea handler has bulldozed her way through the first three episodes unpleasantly lurching from one snide comment to the next

8083685 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
8083686 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

8083689 on the way out the door the bush administration is once again caught misrepresenting the facts to push its own agenda
8083690 this latest announcement is nothing more than a gimmick and offers nothing new or different for states that want to provide effective programs to protect teens health and safety
8083691 the facts are clear abstinence only programs do not work
8083692 the governments own evaluation of title v found that these programs did nothing to increase abstinence or delay sexual initiation among participating youth

8083695 he would be glad he made a start he would be appalled by whats happened since and it would sadden him that it would seem that common sense cant prevail and that there arent enough leaders trying to push the notion of getting along with each other
8083696 i think its very important that his message and his legacy continue he was trying to develop the concept of a retreat for people who wanted to be thoughtful about the issues of the time and for people who wouldnt ordinarily have the opportunity to talk to each other
8083697 we must continue that or be prepared to face the consequences
8083698 its hard for people to believe that in 1957 there was no one advocating nuclear disarmament and there was no one saying atmospheric nuclear testing was dangerous
8083699 it turned out the scientific community knew differently something really special happened here in 1957 it may not seem unusual now but it was then and it was immensely influential
8083700 we live in a time when people look for short term political advantage than whats going to benefit society over the long term we have a whole host of issues that people should be on the same side on no one wants nuclear war no one wants global warming or disease but we cant seem to get focused on these issues over territorial or political issues

8083714 tak jarang isu energi dan pangan dijadikan alat untuk mengguncang pemerintahan yang sedang memerintah
8083715 pemerintahan sby jk pernah mengusulkan pengembangan pembangkit tenaga nuklir namun ini ditentang keras sebab risikonya sangat besar
8083716 belajar dari hal itu pada 2005 2006 pemerintahan sby jk akhirnya memutuskan menaikkan harga bbm secara langsung sebesar 50 100
8083717 oleh karena itu pemerintahan sby jk kemudian memilih mengembangkan sektor energi alternatif seperti batubara
8083718 selain batubara masih ada beberapa opsi lainnya seperti biogas geothermal biodiesel energi surya dan tenaga air

8083740 i was told the tumour would grow rapidly if i didnt undertake chemotherapy
8083741 there was opposition to my choice from the medical establishment but i knew it was my body and i didnt need to follow the herd mentality and just do what everyone else was doing
8083742 i began questioning things and really didnt like what i discovered about these harmful treatments
8083743 the treatments were so lethal they could cause secondary cancers within my body
8083744 they might as well go and tell people to drink the round up in their shed
8083745 it is a horrible journey once you discover you have cancer and many people dont know where to start
8083746 they just go along with what everyone else is doing
8083747 i have to say it has been a positive change to my life and lifestyle not a negative
8083748 i began the canhelp program in february this year and my tumour has reduced by more than a third since then
8083749 i am fit and healthy and feel like a champion
8083750 i had a brain scan last week and received my results yesterday the tumour has not grown
8083751 against the predictions of doctors who told me it would grow rapidly and i only had months to live i am fitter happier and feel better than i ever did
8083752 i am also far more educated on health and have even started my own website to help others
8083753 some of these people have had surgery chemo and radiation therapy and given only weeks or months to live with conventional treatment
8083754 they now expect to rid themselves of cancer and live to old age
8083755 the australian medical association now says one in three australians has some form of cancer and this figure will be half the population by 2010
8083756 the people who will survive this onslaught of cancer are the ones who have the knowledge and ability to knock it over who realise that cancer is not a death sentence
8083757 oh ron come here i want to show you something

8083787 the dark lord is not pleased with your actions against dumbledore he doesnt like failure you are to be brought before him tonight to explain yourself
8083788 only due to your pureblood lineage and my good graces with the dark lord has he agreed to give you an audience
8083789 father i would have finished the job if snape hadnt interfered doesnt he understand that
8083790 this was your task your assignment the chance for you to prove yourself you hesitated and in the eyes of our lord that is worse than total abject failure severus will be dealt with as soon as he is found youre lucky that you were discovered before severus could take you into hiding
8083791 son he has another assignment for you and youre going to do it failure will result in your demise and i will not be able to spare you the next time do you understand
8083792 severus has been an invaluable resource to the dark lord but now that he has been discovered we need another insider another contact in the school and more so we need someone closer to the action potter and his friends are continually scheming against us and the dark lord wants someone on the inside someone close
8083793 to potter and his friends not just physically close we need someone to ingratiate themselves into the group do you understand
8083794 yes i know it wont be easy potter despises you and so do the weasley brats
8083795 they all despise me father theres no way to get on their good side maybe i could befriend one of the hufflepuffs or something and get information second hand or i could try to join the d a some more but potter will never
8083796 then you start with the mudblood shes a girl use your charm your manners women are weak youre a handsome well cultured young man play on her emotions and youll win her over
8083797 father theyll hex me on the spot the moment i enter the gates
8083798 that is why you need to start writing some letters you need to write to every one of your professors to the board of governors and anyone else who will listen and beg to be reinstated at the school agree to any terms promise anything they want as long as they let you return
8083799 i will add what support i can to get you re enrolled i suggest you start writing now because you may not be in any condition to do so tomorrow
8083800 im sorry son but this is how it has to be i expect you to face up to your responsibilities like a man i know youre very capable now you do as ive bidden and all will work out for the best you do this and youll be back in the dark lords good graces and all of the wealth and power you have ever hoped for will be yours
8083801 ill just get started on these letters in my room
8083802 you father has told me of your meeting this evening and ive tried to dissuade this encounter but i fear i have failed
8083803 i remember thinking at the time this is not good we should not allow it
8083804 its hard to be very optimistic because we havent had much contact with him we havent gotten the message that he is very interested by the canadiens we have a place for him and on paper we offer him a nice option
8083805 i know that certain other teams are presently over the salary cap if mats doesnt join us maybe well discuss things with those teams
8083806 finding that the darwin we have been taught about is not the same as darwin in his own words
8083807 writes to me that the boys there go naked until from six to ten years old and he has observed that many of them though not all have their prepuces foreskin removed at circumcision much reduced in length and this he attributes to the inherited effects of the operation
8083808 quite a bit of sophistry in this writing allowing darwin a lot of wiggle room while apparently building his case
8083809 with respect to jews i have been assured by three medical men of the jewish faith that circumcision which has been practised for so many ages has produced no inherited effect
8083810 which might be considered like that commonly produced by circumcision
8083811 notwithstanding the above several negative cases we now possess conclusive evidence that the effects of operations are sometimes inherited
8083812 but it appears at first sight a fatal objection to our hypothesis that a part or organ may be removed during several successive generations and if the operation be not followed by disease the lost part reappears in the offspring
8083813 circumcision has been practised by the jews from a remote period and in most cases the effects of the operation are not visible in the offspring though some maintain that an inherited effect does occasionally appear
8083814 if inheritance depends on the presence of disseminated gemmules derived from all the units of the body why does not the amputation or mutilation of a part especially if effected on both sexes invariably affect the offspring the answer in accordance with our hypothesis probably is that gemmules multiply and are transmitted during a long series of generations as we see in the reappearance of zebrine stripes on the horse in the reappearance of muscles and other structures in man which are proper to his lowly organised progenitors and in many other such cases therefore the long continued inheritance of a part which has been removed during many generations is no real anomaly for gemmules formerly derived from the part are multiplied and transmitted from generation to generation
8083815 uy qu despiste voy a empezar otra vez de cero
8083816 cash and i have been glued to the olympics how amazing was the opening ceremony i still dont know how they coordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync
8083817 ladies and gentlemen last week raw and smackdown announced their main events at unforgiven will be a new concept called a championship scramble
8083818 ne needs it for his ego hes driven by himself
8083819 you got something personal against me i dont even have to be pinned for my title to be taken away its not fair
8083820 well lifes not fair this championship scramble is a brand new concept and its gonna be off the chain it could be three titles changing hands that night the question is will yours be one of them playa
8083821 we created a small incision in the front of the neck using an operating microscope to remove the fragment from the spinal cord and nerve the operation took approximately an hour and a half
8083822 i think johns prognosis is excellent we performed this same procedure on three all pro nfl players and all three resumed their football careers
8083823 as far as what couldve gone wrong during surgery is infection and not removing all the disk material in cenas case everything went well
8083824 dr maroon and i expect a full recovery in a couple of weeks hell be able to start with leg cardio and then resistance training in four to six weeks the bone graft that was put into his neck needs to heal before he can see action

8083827 no one is more excited than kevin that holly is in the office no one
8083828 this season theyll have to deal with a long distace relationship
8083829 mindy is a big fan of mad men and she knew that i was a big fan of the office
8083830 so we mused about finding some way to get me over there
8083831 i cannot believe that you guys pulled the rug out from under us like that
8083832 i think that well be satisfied with how much we see toby and ryan toby disappeared in the finale of last season and ryan was seemingly arrested so tying up those stories will be interesting we havent seen the last of toby is what i can tell fans personally i dont mind seeing less of him just kidding theyre my friends
8083833 i went for a couples massage with my bf towards the end of spa week random spa pick and we were not disappointed

8083844 yes i know but what kind like automatic filter french press steam pump etc
8083845 this is not the time for excuses we have been outplayed england are playing with huge motivation and huge aggression
8083846 we have got to find out what the problem is we have got a lot of experience and we have got to tap into a bit of that
8083847 we have had times on this tour when we have had to look at each other honestly and find out what mistakes we are making our rhythm and confidence is not right i dont think reading the riot act is going to help
8083848 outside of world cup semi finals this is right down there in terms of lows we did not assess conditions well enough
8083849 we have got to look at ourselves and match the england team in the way we have matched in the time that i have been involved all of us need to get together
8083850 it was not a 280 wicket and that affected how we played there was a bit of bounce but if we could have got 230 we could have put them under a pressure but when you are only chasing 80 you play with freedom
8083851 i am trying to get into him that it is really great to be on a wave but you have got to get to a level where you are cool and calm and deliver

8083853 life was a game to him and he played it by his own rules
8083854 i want to be able to honor the public trust
8083855 we want cme to be unbiased and science driven and we dont want it to be influenced by marketing we want our educational activities for whomever we are serving whether its our own faculty or our colleagues in the community locally or globally to be true to the science and the evidence and not be influenced by any kind of financial industry support
8083856 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
8083857 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
8083858 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
8083859 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
8083860 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
8083861 we all agreed it is inappropriate for industry to influence content
8083862 if industry really wants to enhance the education of clinicians they should be given the opportunity to do so
8083863 but we wanted to create a situation in which they had no effect on the choice of topics or their content so were happy to have industry support as long as it is provided without strings or expectations about the course content
8083864 really brings control of cme curricula back to academic medical centers
8083865 one of my hopes is to make stanford a destination so we can hold cme programs here leveraging the wonderful cultural attractions on campus
8083866 i think right now industry is under a lot of pressure in its use of marketing for education theyre re examining their role in cme as well
8083867 as we take this step my hope is that other institutions will start to follow suit i think the climate will change dramatically to enforce that if institutions do not take greater responsibility there is going to be a mandate whether its one that we initiate or one that is imposed that frees up these intertwined interactions of academia and industry around medical education
8083868 it is not exactly clear where this idea came from because there are no studies showing this to be the case
8083869 for decades people have been told that eating these foods increases complications associated with diverticular disease but our results suggest they dont
8083870 the idea that these foods should be avoided is so deeply ingrained in people that i really dont think this study will represent the nail in the coffin
8083871 but it is very well done and a useful contribution to the literature now when patients ask me about this i can tell them that there is not only no evidence of harm from eating these foods there is evidence suggesting a benefit
8083872 its a piece of junk but a really fun piece of junk
8083873 ive heard of other training options for scooters as well some msf classes will let you use a scooter in a regular class with motorcycles
8083874 the bike in the picture looks much nicer than the reality of the one i own too all the plastic parts fit together in the picture and without all the gaps in mine my turn signal stopped working right yesterday it was always flashing left turning it to right made both lights flash like an hazard signal i took out the switch looked at it found nothing wrong with it put it back and it worked fine go figure
8083875 i dont think grown men should be wearing schoolgirl outfits
8083876 its got to be big enough for all my friends and to scare the cars away from me
8083877 on the night of june 2 1932 the worlds first superhero was born not on the mythical planet of krypton but from a little known tragedy on the streets of cleveland it was thursday night about 8 10 p m and mitchell siegel a jewish immigrant from lithuania was in his secondhand clothing store on the near east side according to a police report three men entered one asked to see a suit of clothes and walked out without paying for it in the commotion of the robbery siegel 60 fell to the ground and died
8083878 ever since the devil was crushed by the humility and passion of jesus christ he has been very nearly unable to attack a soul that is armed with meditation on the mysteries of our lords life and if he does trouble such a soul he is sure to be shamefully defeated

8083949 its colorado in august great weather big events and all my old friends
8083950 my sister had grown up hearing my father and me talk about how to judge a persons character by what type of sportsman they are so she asked me to take barack to play basketball if youre looking for a political analysis based on his playing here it is hes confident but not cocky hell take the shot if hes open hes a team player who improves the people around him and he wont back down from any challenge
8083951 if its a line how could there be 2 x axis
8083952 i need to add an h but i dont know how to add an h
8083953 when i make velocity equal to 0 no matter what i put in it always equals 0
8083954 the first part is out of 20 the second out of 60 and the third out of 30
8083955 but i dont understand wha why oh nevermind im stupid
8083956 maybe i should just tell mrs b you dont know how to write your homework down properly that you have problems all the time
8083957 she doesnt even know what the first one is she was trying to tell me and i didnt know what she was saying
8083958 why do you have a compass on your keys do you get lost a lot
8083959 fill your minds with those things that are good and that deserve praise things that are true noble right pure lovely and honorable
8083960 do you ever get the feeling that benjamin is not one of us
8083961 learning is finding out what you already know doing is demonstrating that you know it teaching is reminding others that they know it as well as you do
8083962 what sculpture is to a block of marble education is to the soul
8083963 it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it
8083964 teaching is not a lost art but the regard for it is a lost tradition
8083965 the only thing that interferes with my learning is my education
8083966 it is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge
8083967 a teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on a cold iron
8083968 activist lexicographer erin mckean checks up on john linnell of the band they might be giants to see if hes delivered on his promise to promote three under appreciated words
8083969 i think dave trembley has done a great job here he has done everything he could do to change the focus and direction of this organization
8083970 i dont think he ever gets out managed i think he has the respect of the players he also has a passion for the game itself that as a player you really appreciate hes into it every day hes not showing up here at 5 oclock
8083971 ive got to play every game to win its like i told andy when i took over whether im here one day or two days or two months you dont need to tell me how long and i wont ask ill do the best job i can every time out here
8083972 im just a big proponent of respect for the game would i do something differently if i had a long term contract what would i do differently not play to win that wouldnt be very ethical would it
8083973 we all wish it were better but you have to be a team guy and understand the big picture
8083974 what do they expect were better than we were this season has been a lot more fun than last year i want this season to be remembered for what we accomplished not for how the season could end
8083975 il vaut mieux suivre le bon chemin en boitant que le mauvais dun pas ferme
8083976 last year it was frustrating i did some pretty good things but i didnt play as well as i wanted to all the time i figured that with me being able to go out and practice on a consistent basis i wont have those peaks and valleys and lows and things like that i can just stay on one even plane and just try to be great every sunday
8083977 im just going to go out and just continue doing things that i do on the football field and just try to be great each week and be consistent just try to go out and make my team better any way i can everything else out of that will take care of itself
8083978 weve just got to make the best of this week and then next week
8083979 i think our timing will be fine he knows what hes doing i can read his body so its just a matter of making sure our timing is fine but i think we can get that back together in a week
8083980 the most important thing to me is getting us ready as a group and getting ready for miami
8083981 i really look at the last preseason game as being able to evaluate individuals as opposed to the team and its really important from that perspective
8083982 he went in there and was really put behind the eight ball with that first drive
8083983 somehow got a first down there drove them down the field and converted two fourth downs what im seeing more out of kellen is the patience in the pocket the ability to assess the defense knowing what to get to offensively the poise ive liked that
8083984 you want to go out and have a good showing
8083985 obviously you want to leave a taste not only in the fans mouth but your teammates and coaches as well
8083986 this will be the last time i play this year
8083987 i have really enjoyed long island i enjoyed it from not just a business perspective or a professional side but from a family side were excited about going to the new facility its an incredible space but its hard to leave old friends as well
8083988 i see im right there with the top players and it gives me a lot of confidence to know that i can stay with her and i can be in the games
8083989 i had a set point in the first set so that gives a whole lot of confidence
8083990 so i think im just going to give it 100 percent on the tour and see where that takes me
8083991 its not about the xs and os its about the jimmys and joes
8083992 i dnt no who the expletive u think u dealin wit
8083993 there is no word on when the lsu english department will allow him back
8083994 he couldnt do anything about it because he was mute
8083995 yeah he was mute i kept longing for benny straight through high school
8083996 no being mute was what made him perfect but thats not what made me love him i had a crush on him like all the other girls but when we were on a science retreat camping trip in sixth grade the other boys were picking on him and kicked him out of their cabin while he was taking a shower and stole his towel and when i saw him cry i loved him
8083997 all smiles as if she was in the middle of picking daisies when her phone blessedly rang
8083998 back to her and shell keep the beat going until you get bored with it because she certainly wont
8083999 jam sessions and i just cant help it anymore i do the most uncool thing one can ever do in an office setting i put her on speakerphone
8084000 ahem excuse me young master mc but i cant hear nina totenberg over your incessant racket
8084001 you have to get down on your knees to rise up
8084002 hey i could earn 5 000 a week working from home
8084003 well yes their mothers over there with girl twin looking through the cds
8084004 little fat man isnt it a shame what the river has done to this poor crackers land
8084005 jen we cant just stop we have a chase car on our tail
8084006 it was bright yellow and i think it was a flower
8084007 you must take some bedouin from here they will train them for you
8084008 youre lucky to have a car let alone a pot to piss in
8084009 my daily life has not changed one iota since katrina and yet i see everything differently
8084010 if you were 20 single and no baby and money were not an object what are five things that you would want to do in life and why
8084011 if you were 60 still no family concerns and money were not an object what are five things you would want to do and why what accounts for the differences between the two lists
8084012 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8084013 acting like a baby and the crying and all this he hated it
8084014 he was always like come on you have to grow up in your mind
8084015 when he plays his best i would take everything he has his power fighting spirit when he plays his worst game then i dont need anything
8084016 i have success now but he was no 1 in the world so i still have to catch up he can teach me many things in life

8084020 i like the dreams of the future better than the histories of the past
8084021 the only question is how long will it take to get there
8084022 just a few filthy rich corporatists who are making vulgar profits
8084023 it is going to happen where is the dam going to crack first
8084024 i dont see it as obama doing this i see this as the country doing this
8084025 there was a sign put on a new drinking fountain in the back by the streets division
8084026 few australians realise the extent and quality of their own wilderness
8084027 we just take whats here for granted not realising how rare it is
8084028 as the worlds last great wilderness areas disappear under pressure from human impact to have a continent with this much remaining wilderness intact is unusual and globally significant
8084029 if the land is left empty it will degrade over time thats why one of our focuses is to encourage the employment of indigenous rangers
8084030 we believe these should be full time jobs with the rangers having increased resources like four wheel drive vehicles and where necessary helicopters 700 is just not enough for these vast areas
8084031 by marrying overseas resources with local expertise we aim to make a big difference in looking after our outback
8084032 the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis

8084034 the government deemed it fit to review all mining arrangements with the aim of improving them so as to serve the best interests of the country and its people and also to avoid confrontations between corporate mining entities and local communities incidents which have resulted in unrest and loss of lives in the past
8084035 the government has as its primary interest the people especially the host mining communities
8084036 it is not just about setting up a selected task force that does not take into account the concerns of organisations monitoring the extractive industry as well as the views of the affected communities
8084037 a lot of factors touching on the interests of land owners the adequate payment of royalties lease agreements corporate social responsibility and a host of others have to be taken into consideration
8084038 the task force must review and make public all mining contracts ensure environmental protection is treated seriously and involve communities and civil society in all matters relating to mining
8084039 no political or other undue pressure or interference is exerted on members of the task force whether by government officials or mining companies
8084040 i hire a caterpillar machine for 1000 for eight hours to open up mining sites and have to care for dozens of my miners and their relatives so any adjustment in the laws that are unfavourable to us miners would simply discourage me it is not that one always finds diamonds sometimes i run at massive loss
8084041 before the 11 year long civil war fought between 1991 and 2002 we had more than 14 exporters now there are less than six so this tells you how the business is going any more taxes or conditionalities put on the way of exporters may well be too much and discouraging
8084042 the concept of independent scientific review has been in practice since the 18th century and is crucial to ensuring that ideas and proposed work are scientifically sound
8084043 this overhaul of the endangered species act would place the fate of rare species in the hands of government stakeholders who are not qualified to assess the environmental impacts of their activities
8084044 what if we allowed pharmaceutical companies to approve and distribute drugs without consulting the food and drug administration
8084045 the result would spell potential disaster for humans in this case the vulnerable party is our environment
8084046 in fact wed like to see it go a little bit further
8084047 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8084048 consistently opposed the asbestos bill because it was unfair he thought it was dead wrong that if the trust fund ran out of money for the victims they couldnt even get their rights back
8084049 no sen biden was a well known opponent of the asbestos bill and beau biden was a prominent attorney who was working on behalf of mesothelioma victims
8084050 for 35 years sen biden has had one and only one position on these issues he believes that victims have rights to hold accountable those who injure them

8084077 i could leave it open until the day before the game
8084078 going in i know three or four guys will play no matter who starts
8084079 you dont know if their new guy deline kicks deep or if the ball goes to the 10 yard line

8084082 managed properly canadas share of this incredible endowment will fuel the prosperity of our country for generations and geo mapping will pave the way for the resource development of the future
8084083 if we continue to lose ice at this rate we will best
8084084 were going to lose that ice so weve got to understand what this means for the rest of us
8084085 already showing patches of open water within the ice much of the beaufort sea north of alaska is open and the laptev sea and east siberian sea have opened extensively in the past 13 days
8084086 it is very unusual to see so many bears in the open water at one time during a short flight period
8084087 its very worrisome its what we had anticipated but its happening right before our eyes
8084088 its just yet another wake up call in a long line of wake up calls to politicians in this country that says hey get your act together when it comes to global warming
8084089 current sea ice reduction is progressing at a very fast rate that appears to have no analogs in the past
8084090 sustained changes in sea ice coverage may cause perhaps the largest temperature changes observed on the planet
8084091 we knew we were vulnerable starting out in terms of ice cover

8084094 defendants intentional spoliation of computer evidence significantly prejudices plaintiffs because it puts the most relevant evidence of their claim permanently beyond their reach

8084103 guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you guard it with the help of the holy spirit who lives in us
8084104 god has saved us and called us to a holy life not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace this grace was given us in christ jesus before the beginning of time
8084105 for god did not call us to be impure but to live a life
8084106 how could he do such a thing without talking to us
8084107 ive put thousands into his music business aspirations down the drain

8084110 this is the one i esteem he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word
8084111 but whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a man and whoever offers a lamb like one who breaks a dogs neck so i also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring upon them what they dread
8084112 for god was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him jesus christ and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether things on earth or things in heaven by making peace through his blood shed on the cross
8084113 it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins

8084122 oil refineries contribute substantially to global warming posing grave threats to new yorks environment health and economy as long as the bush epa continues its blatant violation of the clean air act and its shameful refusal to control global warming pollution i will continue to fight them aggressively on all fronts
8084123 a recent trip to asia revealed that a number of japanese and south korean lcd tv oems are considering increasing their level of outsourcing to ems providers and odms
8084124 the major asian lcd tv brands which traditionally have been loath to outsource lcd tv production said the use of contract manufacturing could help them to improve risk mitigation and asset flexibility during a time of economic uncertainty

8084126 i was in front of the front row last night
8084127 last night before i went to the floor i saw that theres a press room its lovely its air conditioned
8084128 then theres a little room off to the side and its dark and its dank were clearly not allowed to mingle with the big kids im hoping in 2008 or 2012 well get past that
8084129 other than that its amazing we have our own space
8084130 physical presence counts for a lot in 2004 there were bloggers but we didnt have a space what it says is we are here we are present in a way we havent been before
8084131 its an interesting time to meet my fellow bloggers and learn a lot more about how the sausage gets made
8084132 its fun to be part of a community thats merging into its own in the progressive community
8084133 you guys are a couple years ahead of us as far as the use of internet in politics
8084134 with raising money people have to be used to using their credit card online or used to giving their e mail out
8084135 its not about technology per se its more a cultural thing
8084136 the access to the convention center is the most important thing if you want to be able to say you attended
8084137 but to be honest the big tent is much better
8084138 theres an obama mania in greece and europe in general
8084139 the media loves him and bloggers love him too since hes used the internet in his campaign i hope he keeps them mesmerized after the election if he gets elected when it really becomes difficult
8084140 i spent a week in iowa with my 14 year old daughter freezing our butts off for john edwards
8084141 i live in a place in alabama where i cant get cell phone access from my house and i cant use wireless internet because we dont have broadband out in the country
8084142 edwards spoke to those issues when edwards pulled out i just kind of checked out and waited to see
8084143 that was really nice because it made us realize people actually care what were writing and want to hear from us
8084144 the room we were offered was 45 a night so we jokingly referred to it as the blogger crackhouse
8084145 one of our bloggers is staying at the media housing though and he said its basic economy lodging and we wouldve been fine there
8084146 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8084147 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8084148 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8084149 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8084150 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8084151 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8084152 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8084153 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8084154 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8084155 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8084156 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions
8084157 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8084158 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8084159 none of the six party talks joint statements however commits the us to any deadline for removing north korea from the list
8084160 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
8084161 i can confirm that us personnel remain on the ground at the yongbyon facility monitoring the sites
8084162 at this stage if the north koreans are not prepared to make specific commitments on verification i think the process will bog down probably for the remainder of the bush administration
8084163 i dont think the bush administration will cave in on this

8084166 infor does not have tonnes of partners as it does not want them to compete some partners will be terminated and some just need energising
8084167 partners will be recruited across territories such as the nordics where we noticed we were lacking some some partners will be exclusive to their territory
8084168 there are already several new improved versions of the kindle in the works

8084177 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8084178 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8084179 he was almost done he was ready to get out
8084180 he was a good kid quiet smart kept to himself
8084181 but he chose to go into the army philip studer said
8084182 he wanted to see the world and do some good
8084183 he stood straighter he was more assertive he was more talkative philip studer said
8084184 he wanted to use his experience in a nonmilitary way studer said
8084185 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8084186 examine from this point of view the consequences of russias decision
8084187 looking at a variety of options with regard to consequences for russias behaviour in georgia its aggression in georgia
8084188 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
8084189 russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8084190 the united states and some european capitals are promising saakashvili defence by nato calling for the re arming of the tbilisi regime and already starting new arms deliveries to him

8084192 international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others

8084199 this is the most boring job in the whole world i want some action some adventure some

8084201 i dont care if my basket is empty im through im going to get out of here

8084203 the master drinks too much mead you could let a chicken loose in there and hed sleep right through it
8084204 if only i had a friend someone i could really talk to these girls dont understand they think im something that im not
8084205 but why whats the point im so small and yet i crave so much i cant even really do anything except for dream and wish for a better life but where would i start its impossible
8084206 it cant be coincidence that ive had the same dream every night and that ive woken every night before learning what was on the altar
8084207 i wonder no its cant be true theres no real cave this is ridiculous
8084208 i havent a clue as to where i am or how to get to the great falls
8084209 but do you know the way to the great falls
8084210 the great falls are a 5 days journey from here traveler
8084211 where did you get that mark ive seen one like it before in an old book thats been in my family for generations
8084212 i guess i was born with it do you know what it means
8084213 father this girl has a mark that looks like the symbol in our heirloom book
8084214 but this mark is an ancient symbol as old as orlana i believe destiny has chosen you for a special purpose
8084215 me im not that special im just trying to reach the great falls
8084216 it sounds silly but i keep having this dream about the falls i want to go there just to find out why
8084217 take one of our horses its only a 2 days ride from here
8084218 they were concentrating on the more severe forms of the condition but we felt it was important to get this information out there
8084219 with all other diabetes medications we know there has been pancreatitis and some of those people have died
8084220 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other

8084226 was born on third base and then he stole second
8084227 was born on third base and thought he hit a triple
8084228 he was almost done he was ready to get out
8084229 he was a good kid quiet smart kept to himself
8084230 but he chose to go into the army philip studer said
8084231 he wanted to see the world and do some good

8084233 he wanted to use his experience in a nonmilitary way studer said
8084234 in a mood to come to us if they shall be compelled to give up their first love
8084235 the audience like a wild colt with a bit between his teeth rose above all cry of order and again and again the irrepressible applause broke forth and resounded far and wide
8084236 no comanches no panthers ever struck a higher note or gave screams with more infernal intensity
8084237 shouldering the symbolic fence rails that lincoln had supposedly split republicans paraded through the streets to the music of a dozen bands
8084238 gov obama is going to bring the change we need to have the chance at bat
8084239 the summer events were well attended especially the friday night indie concerts that drew regular crowds of 500 people
8084240 the long term objective for my mississauga is to attract over one million visitors to the civic square on an annual basis and build community awareness of the square as the downtown focal point survey feedback media exposure and attendance indicate the program interest and has been well received by residents
8084241 almost every day there are street parties and reggae concerts in jamaica
8084242 when i came here six years ago i really missed them im pleased that more and more events like this one are cropping up
8084243 o que eu tenho a perder al m de 6 selos e r 12 00
8084244 this match is going to help me because it was so challenging
8084245 i was missing a lot of match practice so i got a tough one
8084246 the last game i had a couple of mishits but i tried to stay strong concentrate on each point and forget what happened i am so happy i managed to do that
8084247 it was a little bit windy outside so i am happy i could play two sets and win my match
8084248 and the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt
8084249 wise is the tongue wet of perfect thought and softest neck where always do i lay my clumsy thoughts
8084250 that billboard prose shining on me and it shines because its been so long since my telstar i hope it crashes in the sea
8084251 my heart is crammed in my cranium and it still knows how to pound
8084252 steeples dont hurt any more than they used to hurt
8084253 impenitent brothers sway to the song of a new heretical dawn
8084254 maybe i know where to run brother i know where to hide
8084255 i am a tastemaker and i kill things i am not a tastemaker and i kill things
8084256 and jennifer your haltertop a consecrated altar but ive run my hands and knees in shame there one too many times
8084257 outlandish schemes for the andover dreams weve weaned ourselves off of and off of and off of
8084258 i just finished the book and some of its true
8084259 i thought ibm was born with the world the u s flag would float forever the cold opponent did pack away the capital will have to follow its not eternal imperishable oh yes it will go
8084260 i am the trick my mother played on the world
8084261 before i go i gotta ask you dear about the tan line on your ring finger
8084262 youll never fail like common people and watch your life slide out of view
8084263 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human proteins bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
8084264 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8084265 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8084266 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8084267 have one shot to get it right and the status quo wont cut it
8084268 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8084269 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8084270 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8084271 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8084272 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8084273 so how did it feel to fuck someone like me
8084274 oh my god man i totally lost my id it was stolen with a bunch of my other stuff
8084275 oh my god your cock is sooooo big i can barely take all of that in my tiny little pussy
8084276 ok when i said yes this wasnt what i signed on for
8084277 we are not going to support an attempt to grandstand on the last sitting day of private members bill in this place where we will see five bills introduced by the liberal party which have no prospect of any substantive debate or passage in this place
8084278 the 2008 convention program will bring together americans who will speak to john mccains vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations we are excited about next week and we are looking forward to showcasing john mccains life long record of putting his country first
8084279 we are thrilled to announce our full program of speakers and program participants we look forward to presenting a convention program that will share senator mccains unparalleled record of experience and service with millions of americans
8084280 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
8084281 if you find faults with our country make it a better one if you are disappointed with the mistakes of government join its ranks and correct them
8084282 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
8084283 it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence sovereignty of almighty god to obey his will to be grateful for his benefits and humbly to implore his protection and favors
8084284 if a man remains in me and i in him he will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing
8084285 so i say live by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature
8084286 those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires
8084287 with a 4 0 advantage we were maybe a bit under par
8084288 but we controlled the game we wanted to win we didnt want to lose
8084289 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove he deserves to play
8084290 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8084291 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8084292 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8084293 im feeling confident and i feel like im just really really really enjoying myself
8084294 ive been feeling good about my serve for a long time now its definitely one of my strongest shots and today it was there again
8084295 i was doing a lot of the things well to the olympics and i was really confident coming in here
8084296 i always come to a tournament trying to do my best and i never look at anyone else as like theyre favourites to win
8084297 one year i really ran into a lot of bad luck where i got the worst calls possible i couldnt even hit a shot because i was so nervous they would call every ball out
8084298 that really wasnt my fault i probably would have won that year and i was gonna win that year unfortunately it didnt work out
8084299 i didnt even remember holding up the trophy in 2002 i didnt even know i won this tournament thats how long its been
8084300 i really hope i can stick around for some time
8084301 its stupid rules that somebody made in 1850 and now they give me the problems with these things and it shouldnt be that way
8084302 how can a guy see a foot fault with sunglasses from 35 feet metres away it doesnt make any sense
8084303 its stupid rules that somebody made in i dont know 1850
8084304 now they give me the problems with these things and it shouldnt be that way
8084305 how can the guy see with sunglasses from 35 metres away on a foot fault it doesnt make any sense
8084306 its not so complicated the chair umpire when they go with the linesman first when i start to make the foot fault they should tell me listen youre making a foot fault be careful next time im calling it
8084307 and if youre making it on the centre line what difference does it make doesnt help me to serve better
8084308 i think the people in tennis are missing some rules
8084309 its really really disappointing in the fourth set because after a foot fault on the second serve youre facing set point
8084310 i think i have the point here and the people should do something about it if you ask anybody in the locker room they will tell you the same thing its wrong the officials they should change something because they dont understand it
8084311 ive been already on tour for 10 years and i want to enjoy my tennis i dont want to fight anybody i dont want any problems on the court i just want to enjoy it
8084312 its not like im playing because im starving to death and i need to do something original to earn money
8084313 more bad than good can happen by having that a scalpel doesnt make you a doctor a saw doesnt make you a carpenter and just merely having a gun at home does not make you a prepared citizen to defend yourself you need to know how to use it when to use it and when not to use it
8084314 beyond the immediate restoration of the 80 000 cubic metres all the infrastructure the engineering work the recycling piping the dredging material that will bring the sand back onto the beach hasnt been done before

8084317 people will be able to get their teeth into some really healthy discussions about a whole range of issues from planning to relationships all sorts of stuff that drives what we do
8084318 one of the big issues for us is to make this document a kick off for a process where the community gets together to decide what we want darwin to look like in a whole range of ways
8084319 there is certainly the numbers in the house now to bring a lot more government process and governance in general and i am absolutely confident that the council will have a very positive working relationship with both parts of the house
8084320 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
8084321 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial
8084322 there have been various evaluations of alcohol initiatives so wed be able to look at whats happened in the past and see what some of the possible impacts are
8084323 when its still the height of baseball season and the opening game of football is on
8084324 will make the nations your heritage and the ends of the earth your possession

8084331 i thank god who has been with me through this gruelling election process i thank the voters
8084332 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
8084333 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
8084334 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race
8084335 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
8084336 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
8084337 people can handle defeat defeat is not the ultimate punishment hope is hope is the great tormentor in that it often is what leads you forward to your next defeat
8084338 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
8084339 bush should have called for engagement and sacrifice after 9 11 meme is kind of a compelling argument for people like me the problem of course is that hes not setting up any way in which obama calls for engagement and sacrifice
8084340 barack obama will unify america and he will lead us into a bright future and you will vote for him or i will come to your house while you sleep and i will eat your children
8084341 vous dites toujours ce que vous avez fait mais jamais ce que vous allez faire
8084342 with obama having opposed the war theres no real reason for demonstrations
8084343 radicals of the 60s dont get credit for what has happened for good in the democratic posted on rhetorical wasteland in corvallis
8084344 he dont belong in political office or blacks dont belong in political office
8084345 will not allow the spilling of the blood of the sons of iraq by granting open immunity
8084346 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
8084347 even if it does rhyme with harry potter surely there is a limit to cases
8084348 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8084349 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8084350 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8084351 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8084352 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8084353 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8084354 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8084355 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8084356 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8084357 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8084358 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8084359 wir wollen die vielzahl der projekte in dieser stadt erhalten wir brauchen sie sie machen die vielfalt dieser stadt aus
8084360 f r manche der kleinen initiativen sind schon 1000 euro weniger eine existenzbedrohung und wir glauben nicht dass ihr das richtig im blick habt
8084361 ich habe unheimlich angst dass es mit der stadt bergab geht dass wir jetzt b der schlie en m ssen und hnliches sie haben sich durch ihre prestigeprojekte jeglichen spielraum genommen
8084362 der rp hat die weisheit auch nicht mit l ffeln gefressen wie man am beispiel darmbach sieht da hat er uns doch jahrelang vor sich hergetrieben mit dem quatsch
8084363 ich teile die ans tze des rp in vielen punkten
8084364 sonst w rden wir hier weiterhin infrastrukturma nahmen beschlie en die nachfolgende generationen bezahlen m ssen
8084365 est il vrai que vous tes en concert avec du vent dans les cordes
8084366 nous confirmons bien volontiers que les d manilleurs seront en concert
8084367 de toute fa on si a ne leur plait pas on les rembourse
8084368 against the backdrop of high oil prices and weakening consumer demand we are well placed to succeed over the coming months
8084369 we do not recognize virgins claims to be taking business from us on the grounds that passengers do not like terminal 5
8084370 we want to make sure everyones looking out for this one
8084371 after it gets into the gulf it has the potential to go anywhere
8084372 if this storm continues to come this way ill be changing my travel plans
8084373 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in the health insurance from public health insurance
8084374 over the past few days we have received reports from users of spam and phishing attacks
8084375 we have also detected and contained a worm we are investigating every report removing false content blocking bogus links and addressing the concerns of our users these efforts have limited the affected users to a small percentage of those on facebook
8084376 it is very similar to a lot of the old worms
8084377 if you receive messages from a friend on a social network you are not expecting them to be a vehicle to carry a worm or trojan horse
8084378 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8084379 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8084380 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8084381 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8084382 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8084383 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8084384 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8084385 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8084386 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8084387 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8084388 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8084389 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8084390 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8084391 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8084392 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8084393 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8084394 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8084395 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8084396 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8084397 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8084398 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8084399 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8084400 do we have a quarterback it seems like chris mortensen is making the decision on our quarterback for our football team but nothing has changed
8084401 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8084402 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8084403 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8084404 this should be a priority in their professional development just the way working on their short game is a priority
8084405 the lpga could come out and say they only want 10 koreans but theyre not
8084406 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8084407 saves that network from slapping on a bumper sticker barack obama could cure cancer and theyd figure out a way to frame it as an economic disaster
8084408 i dont think hes being passed off as a sage
8084409 but being out of touch with mainstream america is nothing new to jon as evidenced by the crash and burn ratings of this years oscars telecast
8084410 that false sense of urgency they create the sense that everything is breaking news the 24 hour networks are now driving the narratives and everyone else is playing catch up
8084411 that colors your vision of them so clearly and so profoundly
8084412 i dont say access is useless but the more you get sucked into it the more you become part of that machinery
8084413 liberal bias and not wanting to be racist they want him to win badly and yet dont like black people
8084414 an age joke about mccain is at this point somewhat meaningless because its already trite
8084415 he knows were there to introduce him to 20 year olds smoking out of apple bongs
8084416 he is being questioned at the police station in sderot for entering the gaza strip in defiance of a military decree banning israeli citizens from doing so
8084417 pas trop starac le r pertoire mais ya de lambiance
8084418 id best get out of here before i get to fighting
8084419 you know what i got to know him and then i was impressed and that is how you can get to know him and youll see that theres real substance to him
8084420 according to the latest data from the internal revenue service average adjusted gross income in 2006 hit 58 029 in 2006 dollars it was the first time that average income had exceeded the peak year of 2000 the year before incomes began to decline the average income in 2006 was 1 2 or 739 higher than in 2000 when incomes were swollen by capital gains from a roaring market and 1 369 over the 2005 average
8084421 a stock market crash and the 9 11 attacks hit incomes hard as did a series of fed rate hikes the effects of the resulting slowdown continued until bushs economic policies especially his tax cuts kicked in
8084422 thanks to a growing economy americans real disposable income has increased every quarter but two from the beginning of 2003 when bushs policies started going into full effect to the first quarter of 2007 some of the growth was remarkable including a 7 5 jump in the fourth quarter of 2004 and a 6 3 increase in the third quarter of 2003
8084423 theres been some reluctance on the part of a couple of unions
8084424 this race is very complicated because there is an african american candidate for president
8084425 we feel there is a racial component for some union members but were confident we can overcome that
8084426 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats
8084427 in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
8084428 its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself
8084429 sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about the hardware and platforms
8084430 because mgs4 was optimized for the ps3 it is probably not possible to make the game in other formats
8084431 if were talking about the future not mgs4 but my future titles if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know it wont be based on the hardware anymore
8084432 probably i will first create the software and then port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas
8084433 in reality islam is a revolutionary ideology and programme which seeks to alter the social order of the whole world and rebuild it in conformity with its own tenets and ideals muslim is the title of that international revolutionary party organized by islam to carry into effect its revolutionary programme and jihad refers to that revolutionary struggle and utmost exertion which the islamic party brings into play to achieve this objective
8084434 but i know thine abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy raging against me
8084435 and thats how i wound up at the gymnasium of a high school
8084436 what were you trying to do in your speech last night
8084437 i thought i covered that ground in the speech last night
8084438 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats
8084439 in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware

8084445 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
8084446 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
8084447 its night like this that i know someday just how ok im going to be
8084448 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8084449 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
8084450 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
8084451 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin
8084452 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
8084453 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here

8084456 we can continue to resolve the matter amicably however long that may take
8084457 more than ever reflects the face of education in this country
8084458 its essential that all students strive to attend college and then succeed in their classes and ultimately graduate were gratified to see that our country is moving increasingly toward being a nation of college graduates
8084459 some of these kids wouldnt have taken the sat just a few years ago they wouldnt have wanted to they wouldnt have been encouraged to and both are changing
8084460 i also take it as a challenge its not fair to build the expectation level and not be able to deliver on the quality of education

8084466 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8084467 we can demonstrate that our client invented these beauty products
8084468 david babaii and kate hudson have said they invented the product claiming to have invented and developed a product that is delivered ready to go is not only fraud
8084469 in fairness to ms hudson she may be unaware of the products history as she entered into a relationship with wildaid after the products had already been created we are working to ensure that our client receives the compensation owed them
8084470 kate and her attorneys are only just learning of the complaint as kate has not yet been served
8084471 kate does not know the plaintiffs and has never met with them or spoken with them her representatives believe that the claims are baseless and without merit and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit
8084472 we stand by our actions during the research and development process of the david babaii for wildaid hair care line and believe that 220 laboratories allegations are baseless and without any merit
8084473 if we are formally served with the complaint we will vigorously defend this claim

8084475 we have said before very clearly that the program judges the list itself because we do not visit the restaurants other than the grand awards

8084479 great but is podcasting a medium that i can use a medium on which i could advertise
8084480 because our markets are very specific we were delighted to find that our clientele resonates with many of the broadcasts that personal life media offers it is always beneficial to educate your customer base we never favored the idea of posting cumbersome articles on our web site personal life media has done an amazing job of packaging this information into a format that is very appealing
8084481 we chose this form of marketing because it sends a progressive message to our customers
8084482 perhaps it gives our viewers something they havent seen before on a web site or at the very least subtly communicates to our customers that we greatly appreciate the time they are spending with us

8084531 a partir del d a de la fecha moment neamente no vamos a tener representante en el ipauss porque hemos analizado la situaci n y no queremos que el municipio sea corresponsable de algunas decisiones que son desacertadas y se est n tomando tal es el caso de la mantenci n del nivel de acreencias sin reclamos para el cobro y que los recursos del instituto est n garantizados nosotros hemos propuesto que los 4 5 millones de deuda que tenemos a causa de lo que no gir el gobierno provincial por coparticipaci n lo hagamos un plan de pagos pero vemos que el trato no es similar con otras instituciones sobre todo con el estado provincial
8084532 en el caso del municipio propusimos al presidente del ipauss vicente sinchicay un plan de pagos porque somos conscientes de la situaci n y lo vamos a concretar el viernes en oportunidad del consejo econ mico y social y all vamos a impulsar la firma de un convenio de 24 cuotas mensuales para la cancelaci n de la deuda
8084533 de algunas pautas presupuestarias que se va a presentar la semana que viene y de distintas iniciativas que se est n tomando y que el gobierno nacional comprometi su participaci n en relaci n a la presentaci n del relevamiento de factor humano dentro de la administraci n p blica como parte de un proceso de modernizaci n del estado y el sistema de retiros y licenciamientos voluntarios que fue aprobado por la naci n porque son mecanismos no traum ticos de saneamiento de la planta estatal
8084534 el acompa amiento del ejecutivo provincial al proyecto de ley presentado por los diputados fueguinos en relaci n a la declaraci n de tierra del fuego como provincia aerodependiente
8084535 la importancia estrat gica de recuperar la l nea de bandera y poder garantizar la frecuencia que establezcan un v nculo real entre la isla y el continente en una integraci n de la ciudadan a y que garantice la previsibilidad en materia de actividad econ mica como lo es el turismo
8084536 ratificamos nuestro inter s de que el ejecutivo nacional acompa e el esquema de inversiones propuesto por shaanxi y de esta forma poder impulsar de manera conjunta entre el gobierno nacional y el provincial la instalaci n de la planta de gasoil derivado de gas que vendr a a resolver una problem tica que tiene el norte argentino y que tierra del fuego le puede dar una soluci n a costos ventajosos para el resto del pa s y tambi n para nosotros con el agregado de que tambi n es generaci n de puestos de trabajo y aprovechamiento de los recursos fueguinos y mejoramiento de los ingresos provinciales
8084537 de algunas pautas presupuestarias que se va a presentar la semana que viene y de distintas iniciativas que se est n tomando y que el gobierno nacional comprometi su participaci n en relaci n a la presentaci n del relevamiento de factor humano dentro de la administraci n p blica como parte de un proceso de modernizaci n del estado y el sistema de retiros y licenciamientos voluntarios que fue aprobado por la naci n porque son mecanismos no traum ticos de saneamiento de la planta estatal
8084538 aunque tenemos una masa salarial proyectada en 1 665 millones de pesos
8084539 si bien faltan a n algunas proyecciones la recaudaci n por coparticipaci n se estima en alrededor de 900 millones m s la recaudaci n interna que hoy es de 37 a 40 millones de pesos esto incluye la tarifaria corta que la comunidad conoce
8084540 no est en el nimo de la c mara y tampoco en una insistencia contundente del ejecutivo de solicitar la pr rroga
8084541 para subsanar el vencimiento de esa normativa el gobierno analiza un r gimen simplificado y la ampliaci n de las bases de las al cuotas
8084542 se realizar a alg n tipo de sustituci n a la ley corta
8084543 pero ampliar la base imponible quiere decir que a partir de esto podemos bajar las al cuotas de actividades que las tienen altas es decir si pagamos todos las al cuotas tienen que bajar en forma proporcional
8084544 lamentablemente algunos n meros van a terminar con d ficit pero no lo voy a cuantificar en este momento porque reci n el mi rcoles o m s tardar el jueves se estar terminando de consolidar el presupuesto
8084545 la evasi n sea del m nimo porcentaje posible porque esto ampl a la base recaudatoria porque rentas est en una instancia terminal dir a tanto en infraestructura como en recursos humanos de modo que lo que tenemos que hacer es aggiornar nuestro brazo recaudatorio
8084546 porque si usted tiene una actividad igual que la m a y yo tributo y usted no la verdad a mi me molesta
8084547 pr cticamente se ha establecido una pauta que rondar a el 10 en el proyectado con incrementos que pueden ir entre el 5 y el 10 por encima a medida que vayan aumentando los ingresos
8084548 nos tenemos que dar cuenta que a veces aunque la pauta salarial no nos guste en el presupuesto proyectado tampoco podemos ser tan irresponsables de comprometernos con pautas que despu s no vamos a poder cumplir
8084549 pero s podemos dejar abierta una puerta como lo dialogamos con la gobernadora r os para que a medida que se incremente la recaudaci n va a ser volcado al funcionamiento del estado y salarios

8084568 theres a mind shift happening in it and were starting to see that change theyre loosening up their policies on whats acceptable

8084705 the film is not about diana georgiana is an incredible person on her own without need to draw parallels
8084706 the two were related by ancestry and united by destiny
8084707 georgina was incredibly glamorous obviously and politically she was incredibly influential but also incredibly vulnerable and shes really navigating her way through a marriage that is entirely loveless
8084708 there is absolutely no reason to have done this trailer the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get the young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana
8084709 but they did not need to and should not have done it trailers should be what the film is about but in this case the trailer is not connected to the film

8084729 if youre burning out and the burnout expresses itself as irritability you might find yourself always snapping at people or making snide remarks about them

8084738 allerdings nicht mehr auf nationaler sondern auf europ ischer ebene
8084739 kommt es zu einer re politisierung der wirtschaftsverfassung auf europ ischer ebene ein grund f r die wirtschaft sich jedenfalls u erlich gegen einen kompetenzzuwachs europas zu stemmen oder wird die wirtschaftsverfassung die sozialverfassung infizieren und auch diese entpolitisieren und damit dem demokratischen prozesse entziehen
8084740 der konflikt im kaukasus hat ganz europa in eine schwierige lage gebracht deutschland aber setzt er besonders zu
8084741 die territoriale integrit t das v lkerrecht m ssen gelten und daf r muss jetzt eine internationale beobachter und peace keeping truppe dorthin und ich hoffe dass die russen die dem ja zugestimmt haben hier jetzt nicht argumente und tricks finden dieses hinauszuz gern zu sagen solange die nicht da ist m ssen wir selbst dableiben
8084742 dann wird das nat rlich konsequenzen haben die zusammenarbeiten schwieriger macht
8084743 beispielsweise so wie in dem konflikt moldawien transnistrien dass diejenigen die sich wirtschaftlich in abchasien und s dossetien engagieren russen russische oligarchen wie auch immer probleme haben damit in die europ ische union zu kommen mit reisebeschr nkungen beschr nkungen was bankkonten angeht und hnliche dinge gerade auf diesen bereich begrenzt gebe es vielleicht auch einige instrumente um wehzutun
8084744 andere friedenssoldaten werden nach s dossetien verlegt w hrend andere truppen nach russland verlegt werden
8084745 und insoweit ist es ein beschluss der keineswegs geeignet ist die lage weiter zu beruhigen
8084746 insofern haben wir auch die erwartung dass weder die russische regierung noch der russische pr sident diesem beschluss des f derationsrats folge leisten werden
8084747 wir erwarten dass auch die punkte die vereinbart sind aber noch nicht erf llt sind in den n chsten tagen erf llt werden

8084777 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
8084778 the scientific community is really going to run with this

8084942 the explanatory descriptions by which these illustrations are accompanied show extensive and accurate knowledge of the literary history of operative surgery all the operative methods and their peculiarities are carefully explained and whoever studies this work cannot fail to understand thoroughly the merit of the different methods proposed for accomplishing each operation this leads us to think that a republication in this country with a translation of the explanatory details would be extremely useful and in such circumstances the number and variety of the instruments represented might be greatly diminished while the anatomical figures and the views of operative processes might be retained

8084987 that means that people go to bed early because they wake up at 7 a m to go on their run or their ride the whole social scene changes because of sports
8084988 if youre sitting around the boardroom around the table its all stiff
8084989 as soon as youre out mountain biking together youre bonding in a way that you just cant do otherwise youre sharing a skill youre sharing pain
8084990 my programmer friends thought it was odd that i was an outdoors person
8084991 for them it was laser tag and flight simulator places
8084992 what has really happened with nerd culture these days is that the number of programmers who are serious bikers is much much higher its part of the social network
8084993 no it wont ever be ok lets not pretend it will
8084994 theyve been reabsorbed into the love from which they emerged they are always right here right now where love is and when i live in love we are not separate
8084995 we came to this city not looking for this type of trouble
8084996 what we have is a bunch of thugs running around with badges
8084997 while i still want to get all of the details this certainly sets the wrong tone for the convention
8084998 were not trying to infringe on anybodys rights we still have a job to do if youre coming out of a railroad yard youre trespassing
8084999 they are wrong we were not in a rail yard
8085000 i was in front of the front row last night
8085001 last night before i went to the floor i saw that theres a press room its lovely its air conditioned
8085002 then theres a little room off to the side and its dark and its dank were clearly not allowed to mingle with the big kids im hoping in 2008 or 2012 well get past that
8085003 other than that its amazing we have our own space
8085004 physical presence counts for a lot in 2004 there were bloggers but we didnt have a space what it says is we are here we are present in a way we havent been before
8085005 its an interesting time to meet my fellow bloggers and learn a lot more about how the sausage gets made
8085006 its fun to be part of a community thats merging into its own in the progressive community
8085007 you guys are a couple years ahead of us as far as the use of internet in politics
8085008 with raising money people have to be used to using their credit card online or used to giving their e mail out
8085009 its not about technology per se its more a cultural thing
8085010 the access to the convention center is the most important thing if you want to be able to say you attended
8085011 but to be honest the big tent is much better
8085012 theres an obama mania in greece and europe in general
8085013 the media loves him and bloggers love him too since hes used the internet in his campaign i hope he keeps them mesmerized after the election if he gets elected when it really becomes difficult
8085014 i spent a week in iowa with my 14 year old daughter freezing our butts off for john edwards
8085015 i live in a place in alabama where i cant get cell phone access from my house and i cant use wireless internet because we dont have broadband out in the country
8085016 edwards spoke to those issues when edwards pulled out i just kind of checked out and waited to see
8085017 that was really nice because it made us realize people actually care what were writing and want to hear from us
8085018 the room we were offered was 45 a night so we jokingly referred to it as the blogger crackhouse
8085019 one of our bloggers is staying at the media housing though and he said its basic economy lodging and we wouldve been fine there

8085028 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
8085029 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8085030 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
8085031 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
8085032 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of camera youre excited and not thinking in english
8085033 the lpga could come out and say they only want 10 koreans but theyre not
8085034 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8085035 this is an american tour it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8085036 were well overdue not just for our sake but everyone elses as well all our supporters the whole organisation
8085037 its fair to say everyones a little disappointed where were at but to be fair mate theres a bit of an edge this week and i think well be okay
8085038 but we are definitely getting better and as ive said before the energy and enthusiasm within this group are going to come to the forefront its just a matter of when
8085039 the collection has been carefully created with some of the finest laces from around the world you will see a lot of satin and lace combined and rich colors such as burgundy and beige silver and peach as well as your classic black and white it makes you feel incredible and offers variety as diverse as the women who will wear it
8085040 janet and i wanted to create a collection that empowers women and that makes women feel sexy flirtatious and provocative we wanted to make sure we captured the essence of all janets favourite colors laces and making sure that we stay true to who she is and what she loves
8085041 that would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
8085042 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a little bit but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
8085043 ive had four other jobs as c e o and i came out of them all pretty well what im working for right now is to save my reputation
8085044 award a prestigious list honoring this years most promising private technology ventures in canada woot congrats to everyone involved

8085048 ill have a review up when its up so dont expect it at any specified date so there
8085049 consumers who want all the benefits of a medium suv but dont need the performance of an awd
8085050 when they announced the football team i swear the whole gymnasium erupted
8085051 our players came running in and they just couldnt believe how loud everybody was
8085052 i think its really interesting when you find students who have interest in a new venue bringing football back bringing that collegiate experience that you see at many other institutions
8085053 whenever you get a chance to be the beginning of something you have a chance to be remembered for a long time so a lot of our freshmen understand that and want to be a part of that
8085054 we have talked about how to keep the shootout fresh anyway
8085055 i wont kid you that coors having the pole winner created a faster dialogue on how to address it
8085056 its no secret the manufacturers need all the exposure they can get
8085057 the winning manufacturer will have bragging rights for a year hopefully this will evolve into a spirited annual competition
8085058 it doesnt take monumental feats to make the world a better place it can be as simple as letting someone go ahead of you in a grocery line
8085059 ok ok i cant quite make up my mind yet
8085060 oh weve got that on tape lawyers will have a field day with that one
8085061 the ryder cup is at the back of my mind right now
8085062 id love to be on that team darren has put the cats amongst the pigeons by winning and weve got poulter in there its going to be tough faldo is keeping his cards close to his chest
8085063 its been difficult to try to shove that in the back of my mind because it keeps coming up
8085064 it keeps presenting itself to me that i very much want to be on that team so ive always got to try to put it back and concentrate on whats at hand and thats playing good golf
8085065 thats why i dont think this is an overall bad thing
8085066 and i think it also can really help the players become more comfortable in the environment they play
8085067 were more of an international tour now but were an american based tour and the players need the tools to interact with fans and sponsors one of those tools is to speak english
8085068 we are proud to have tournaments in 30 countries and players from over 100 competing in them and have no plans to impose a common language on them
8085069 they may well violate florida discrimination laws because language is a key element of persons national origin people should be judged on their ability to perform a job english fluency has no more to do with the ability to play 18 holes of golf than whether you walk 18 holes or ride 18 holes
8085070 organizations and businesses in general have the right to make requirements on skill sets necessary for their employers
8085071 we as a membership organization have the right to establish obligations that our members must adhere to in order to do the things fundamental to conduct our business
8085072 if there is a language barrier hampering the pro am experience that hurts
8085073 you dont want any barriers when it comes to what the lpga does best and thats to interact with fans sponsors and pro am players
8085074 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8085075 welcome to primary 1 6 now that sounds more normal friendly to the average acquaintance rather than asking how i was the former was verging on the perfunctory side i guess
8085076 dig it first they killed those pigs then they ate dinner in the same room with them they even shoved a fork into a victims stomach wild
8085077 i was shocked at the anger toward me i think part of its reserved for women you stepped out of the role of the good girl
8085078 i serve on lots of boards that doesnt mean anything
8085079 decider isnt serving as a standalone business and will do just fine as an extension to the onions newspaper
8085080 it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men
8085081 if ever a time should come when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in government our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin

8085084 i think i need to stick to being on defence
8085085 the kids were great though at first i didnt know how they would react to a touch football game but they knew how to lineup onside they formed the huddle each time and executed plays which was surprising to see with a variety of different age groups
8085086 there are a lot of things here to get kids going to better themselves
8085087 so i think our job coming up here was to push them along that path and i think we accomplished that
8085088 the kids showed they can be really energetic and a lot of fun when motivated the effort is definitely there i had some of the girls that were 14 and older and then i had the young kids that were under eight and they were just excited to run the plays
8085089 many of these kids have lost the ability to dream and what were trying to do is bring that back to them
8085090 they have athletes here that can be role models for them and it provides them with an opportunity to be around the players and coaches and gives them an idea of what things are like outside their community
8085091 it is telling that the first piece of legislation julia gillard has introduced to enact the promised education revolution in our schools is a punitive and populist measure that targets the families of disadvantaged children and is likely to make their lives all the harder
8085092 i am appalled that the government thinks this type of approach is the way to deal with this complex social problem
8085093 the rudd government needs to be looking at the social economic and educational problems that contribute to truancy problems rather than rely on penalizing measures such as welfare quarantining and suspension
8085094 if the government are truly concerned about overall truancy levels why is it only poor and disadvantaged families on income support who are being targeted when we know that troubled kids from all walks of life will cut school
8085095 the government is showing no duty of care for families once their payments are suspended there is continued talk about an education revolution but there is nothing revolutionary in this knee jerk punitive approach
8085096 where is the evidence base that this punitive approach will actually work the real factors behind poor school attendance are the failures of the education system in some regions to deliver appropriate early childhood and primary education and provide educational and social support services for disadvantaged families
8085097 by 2020 only the top two percent of income earners will be at home in australia
8085098 kevin rudd has been keen today to tell his story but the story australians want to hear is a vision of how australia will educate its people in the 21st century
8085099 that means ditching the howard ideology and instead inviting australians to collaborate in thinking about new ways to deliver education so that australia of the future will be healthy happy and able to meet the challenges and opportunities posed by the transition to a low carbon economy
8085100 todays report from the australian education union showing that funding of public schools will fall by almost two per cent over the next four years while non government schools will be granted a three per cent increase is completely unacceptable
8085101 the invisible hand of john howard is still directing education policy in australia
8085102 australias working families cannot wait until 2011 12 for their children to get a fair go in public schools
8085103 what is needed now is an extra 1 5 billion and with the larger than anticipated surplus there are no excuses
8085104 the only way we can achieve the education revolution towards a better educated and more innovative australia is for our public schools to be properly funded and staffed
8085105 i had really a good day last thursday in toronto and then it felt terrible
8085106 its much better today the neck locked up for a couple of days
8085107 the signs are we are going in the right direction thats why we got the mris to see whats going on
8085108 if it continues to progress in the right direction the guys in the trainers room know what to do well just take it a day at a time
8085109 what makes this place so special i dont think is the building its whats happened in this stadium so many great players and great teams have come through here
8085110 any team can erect monuments the reason those monuments are up is because theyre great players thats no secret but were moving what 100 yards the only difference from where i sit their payroll will probably go up a bunch more make it harder for us
8085111 if there were an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misappropriating this administration would take the gold

8085118 and he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
8085119 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8085120 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8085121 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8085122 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8085123 i do not pray for these only but also for those who believe in me through their word that they may all be one even as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also might be in us so that the world may believe that thou has sent me
8085124 and he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
8085125 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8085371 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful again both companies are in the same position
8085372 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8085373 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward

8085380 believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned
8085381 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned
8085382 going back to 1999 john mccain did an interview with the san francisco chronicle saying that overturning roe v wade would not make any sense because then women would have to have illegal abortions
8085383 a fter the event an rnc spokesman reiterated that mccain has been very clear about his position on abortion this campaign cycle and he has he speaks about the life issue at almost every campaign event and his campaign has aggressively courted evangelical voters by highlighting mccains consistent pro life voting record and his stated determination to appoint supreme court justices like samuel alito and john roberts
8085384 id love to see a point where it roe v wade is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe vs wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
8085385 i have always believed in the importance of the repeal of roe vs wade and as president i would work toward its repeal but that must take place in conjunction with a sustained effort to reduce the number of abortions performed in america
8085386 i can assure you that if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8085387 they say i live on a dollar a month but this is all lies by people who dont want my brother to win
8085388 no one knows who i am i live here near nairobi on less than a dollar a month
8085389 they say i live on a dollar a month but this is all lies by people who dont want my brother to win
8085390 i was brought up well i live well even now the magazines they exaggerated everything
8085391 we found out the other day that obama and abc news senior national correspondent jake tapper by the way has done some research into obamas family tree and so far hes been able to count eight half siblings of obama one of them was george hussein obama found in a hut in kenya outside nairobi and we found that old george hussein obama living on less than 1 a month
8085392 how come barry cant send his half brother a 20 bill and almost double the guys annual income
8085393 barack obamas lost brother george hussein anyango obama living in a hut in a ramshackle town on the outskirts of nairobi who is literally living there on less than a dollar a month
8085394 even though obama met with him in 2006 you know the guy is suffering and if obama charity doesnt begin at home with obama then i guess weve got to do something about it
8085395 down in texas the gop party now has a brand new web video out they have paid for it and what theyre doing is theyre using some information that they gleaned from the italian vanity fair article that came out toward the end of last week regarding barack obamas half brother who lives on a dollar a month just outside of nairobi
8085396 if obama cares so much about your family why doesnt he take care of his family first
8085397 im going to talk to vanity fair get george hussein obamas address i will send him the same amount that im sending that family also in africa and ethiopia i will send to george hussein and i will and then and get him out of that shack ill send him less than 500 a year and his standard of living will increase like you have never seen before
8085398 why cant barack pull 20 bucks out of his pocket
8085399 theres the story now afloat that an obama half brother is living in grim poverty in kenya scratching out a bare living on a dollar a month while the senator lives in luxury on 5 million a year
8085400 it seems there are people who want to destroy me and my family
8085401 they say i live on a dollar a month but this is all lies by people who dont want my brother to win
8085402 have you seen john has john mccain commented yet on the homes thing
8085403 no one knows who i am i live here on less than a dollar a month
8085404 someday id like to see one of those beautiful beaches but right now im stuck in this this tiny little wood shack no roof over it
8085405 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
8085406 if anyone says anything to me about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
8085407 people often act without knowing why they do what they do
8085408 the fashion of political writing this year is to suggest that people choose their candidate by their stand on the issues but this strikes me as highly implausible
8085409 although i was quit skeptical at first about what your program could do for me im glad that curiosity had the best of me and that i did try it i have tried other stuff like herbs and creams which did not help me at all but your stuff is something else it really works good for me in several ways i was never able to last more than two minutes before but now i make love to my wife for twenty minutes minimum that part is easy now and thats great but i also feel more confident and self assured in my day to day life can your program make me feel like that or is it just a coincidence
8085410 i have never experienced orgasms like this i never really had much of a sexual appetite but now i can not get enough of the sex and my wife thinks that i am a new man the sex is fantastic and like i said the orgasms are amazing no longer do i have a small 2 second intercourse it is more like 30 minutes and it only took me less than a month of following your program thank god that i found your site i hope you use this on the site
8085411 well who knows he may be announcing some new intergalactic agreement of some kind or other you never know whats going to come out
8085412 what i would like to see him do is focus on the real economic issues
8085413 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8085414 the objective of good government is for government to raise no more money than it needs
8085415 i think its important from time to time that the prime minister take the opportunity at venues like the press club to outline and update our plans for the future
8085416 im not about to blow the lid on whats about to be said today but we have a clear agenda following on from the commitment we made at the last election
8085417 hell be covering the sec and other financial areas as well as picking up some of our broader regulatory coverage
8085418 along the way hes also picked up numerous awards having been part of the teams that won the 2003 pulitzer for coverage of the corporate scandals as well as a loeb and two george polk awards for their coverage of pension and executive pay issues following stints in new york and dallas for the journal hes spent most of the last few years in florida where his wife jennifer liberto is a reporter for the st petersburg times

8085421 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and i guess my point at this stage is we are investigating and i think various people are speculating at what it is but weve had concerns about his behaviour and we are investigating that
8085422 we have a variety of ways we conduct investigations were comfortable with the way we are investigating that
8085423 theres a whole variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly our ethical standards department does an outstanding job
8085424 what people need to understand is that police officers do have discretion many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8085425 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8085426 people have a right to some privacy in policing while we investigate the matter
8085427 all the options are on the table it is a work in progress
8085428 no there isnt that has been the companys strength but it is also the weakness
8085429 ive got no real plans it is just doing the right thing by my colleagues and shareholders

8085441 the republican party is the next guy in line party whoever he picks as vice president could become the next guy in line if he picks a mainstream conservative then the conservatives can get excited not just about the mccain candidacy but the future of the party

8085477 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect upon
8085478 its not a question of wanting to go to an election its the reality
8085479 i had really a good day last thursday in toronto and then it felt terrible
8085480 its much better today the neck locked up for a couple of days
8085481 the signs are we are going in the right direction thats why we got the mris to see whats going on

8085488 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8085489 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8085490 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8085491 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8085492 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8085493 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8085494 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8085495 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8085496 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8085497 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8085498 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8085499 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8085500 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8085501 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8085502 its the place to do something fun and a little out of the box
8085503 its the biggest crowd and its what people are talking about i was fortunate to play and win in the audrey hepburn dress
8085504 there was insufficient evidence that the statements of the suspects constituted a true threat
8085505 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8085506 its a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time and theyve done a very good job with difficult situations in all aspects
8085507 so they made the call wrong once in a while weve all done things wrong once in a while
8085508 for every human individual out there were all playing our best we make errors its part of the game
8085509 we dont get a chance to go back i want a mulligan its not the way it works its not the way it should work
8085510 and its that these were not physical phenomena or flashes caused by the sun but rather ufos spinning and forming a circle remaining like that for several minutes the unfortunate part is that the distance made them impossible to photograph

8085518 there were three former staff member who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8085519 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8085520 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8085521 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8085522 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8085523 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8085524 we wouldnt rule anything in we wouldnt rule anything out

8085527 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful both companies are back in the same position

8085672 g yes we are facing global natural resource problems they are not going to be solved by bullying a small minority who need choose or can afford a larger car most modern 4x4s are no bigger than a london taxi a car specifically designed for london streets as it has maximum space and visability with the footprint of a normal saloon car like a taxi most seat seven to declare these cars too big is ludicrous when they are more efficient than most normal cars and contrary to sians velief they are designed for all roads that includes cities to encourage vandalism and vigilante attacks on drivers is scandalous these vehicles are usually cleaner than most older cars and vans as they have catalytic converters yet sian doesnt target these vehicles why only target the vehicles driven by the rich if it is not socialism
8085673 we know about the massive hacking into the last us election diabold voting machines is it possible here of course it is lol

8085675 we have concluded that our guidance is incorrect in respect of primarily graphical material for this reason we will be amending this section of the guidance note on the vca website by close on 20th june to read as follows
8085676 the regulations define promotional literature as all printed matter used in the marketing advertising and promotion of a new passenger car we are of the view that this definition does include material which is largely graphical with limited textual content perhaps containing only the model name and an advertising slogan we therefore consider that street advertisements are subject to the requirements of the regulations
8085677 anyone up for a revolution in a radical left direction
8085678 how many 4wds in london go on building sites let alone off road

8085680 make notionally unemployed people work for their benefits in recycling centres sorting out our rubbish for us people who say they cant find work when 800 000 eastern europeans seem to have no difficulty whatsoever
8085681 what if those machines had a small amount of intelligence and they could assemble themselves into various shapes and were capable of movement or locomotion
8085682 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways
8085683 on the face of it is difficult to see how livingstones decision falls outside the range of reasonable responses
8085684 a green tax for those who own certain cars in london
8085685 ensure that those who choose to carry on driving the most polluting vehicles help pay for the environmental damage they cause
8085686 it would be more appropriate for porsche to put its effort into making a new generation of much less polluting vehicles
8085687 manufacturers are already modifying their cars to come in just under the co2 threshold
8085688 unfairness to porsche owners was unlikely to wash with the high court
8085689 when you find yourself arguing on the side of a petulant car company against the interests of ordinary londoners you should realise youve taken opposition for oppositions sake too far
8085690 keep out johnson he supports bush and opposes kyoto he is the british equivalent of bush when it comes to the war and environment
8085691 i dont agree with you so that means you are spouting nonsense
8085692 and the truth is that what boris johnson likes is not what you or i like he doesnt share londoners values in fact in many ways he seems to hate them
8085693 boris johnson in contrast would come with a built in tory majority enabling him to do anything he likes over the heads of a powerless opposition in the assembly
8085694 greenladywell you are mistaken to say the least and dishonest when it comes to the green party policies decentralisation has been kicked out thats its still in the books is because they have not changed it yet but they will have to because the two notions are incompatible and schumacher is turning in his grave small is not beautifull anymore according to the greens is centrally lead politics
8085695 why does the green party even if the melon theory is somehwat true lol stand against those it has campaigned with in the stop the war coalition
8085696 the green partys membership is not representative of a multicultural society indeed it is white and middle class still because nobody can be bothered to change this fact so why should multicultural london vote for them
8085697 i do not think that sian has the brevity or green credentials to be a leader still they have not managed to prepare for coalition politics at national level
8085698 their hatred of the lib dems so childish and so damaging for the future is preventing a third way in britain a coalition choice for voters between the lib dems and greens red green coalitions are done everywhere but the reds in britain are not as green as the lib dems talking of cutting your feet off
8085699 as for threatening londoners with boris via all the nasty assumptions made in the article
8085700 ie vote for the lesser evil whilst being eaten by kens mismanagement for breakfast relying on verbal hand outs at the mayors monthly rebutals is frankly pathetic

8085702 his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
8085703 i think any republican leader in this country would be honored to be asked to serve as the vice presidential nominee myself included
8085704 of course this is a nation which needs strong leadership and if the nominee of our party asked you to serve with him anybody would be honored to receive that call and to accept it of course
8085705 everyone knows there is a line sometimes that can be crossed when it comes to free speech
8085706 300 irish republican ex prisoners are to attempt to have their convictions overturned
8085707 mlk i have a dream that one day all free speech will be done in cages
8085708 unlike the other two main candidates neither i or my partner have a car

8085766 for me there are at least three components to stewarts success 1 he and his staff display an uncanny ability to puncture false realities a great gift at a time when so many people feel that their realities are being actively distorted in public life and politics 2 he consistently shines a bright line on a range of issues the mainstream news media often handle with kid gloves or ignore such as the war in iraq the aftermath of hurricane katrina the politicization of the department of justice and more 3 stewart is able to make his points through a combination of satire humor profane language and a host of other techniques all strategically deployed to engage viewers

8085803 she has always been proud to be an american and the fact that we as americans are making an effort to put our racist amp sexist past behind us and show the world that in this country all people including those that have been treated like in this country have a chance at running our coutry raises her level of pride to heights she has never known

8085821 i cant wait to start my new position at city pages
8085822 i think this will be a great opportunity to show my love of the local scene and use the resources at the paper to further investigate and report on local music trends
8085823 yes yes i know its easier to download music and probably cheaper but whats playing on your favorite download store when you walk into it nothing thats what who are you going to meet in there nobody where are the notice boards offering flatshares and vacant slots in bands destined for superstardom whos going to tell you to stop listening to that and start listening to this go ahead and save yourself a couple of quid the saving will cost you a career a set of cool friends musical taste and eventually your soul record stores cant save your life but they can give you a better one
8085824 i was introduced to lots of great music through my local record store it was a place where people knew music and they knew me and could make great suggestions and discoveries whether it is in the physical world or on line the value of a great and knowledgeable record store has not gone away
8085825 i just really love anything thats not faceless and where people know each other and work together to build like a community

8085849 but i get so much from my students they are like my children and i am teaching them to speak i nurture them and help them grow

8085859 dear zuma dogg i am a new subscriber to your blog amp you have become my nightly fix ive been watching you on channel 35 for a couple years however totally respect your clarity and insightfulness kept checking for your blog last night to no avail hope you are okay really appreciate all you do for us victims of l a politicians whatever office you decide to run for count me in as part of your team your big time admirer
8085860 if lorettas comments constitute support i wouldnt want her opposition if i were a charismatic yet vapid democratic presidential nominee
8085861 was always fascinated with the darkness i covered countless shootings urban riots and in several situations i was there before police were because i had a police radio and used to drift around the city until something happened
8085862 frankly my life changed from the moment god entered my heart im not interested in the darkness anymore
8085863 ive got four gorgeous boys a wife i adore i love being alive and i love and enjoy every moment of my life my view has brightened and i dont want to go back into that dark place
8085864 he used the word cured a word that oncologists generally dont use
8085865 he said i didnt have to come back for any checks that my tissue had regenerated to the point where you cannot only not tell that there was ever any cancer there but you cant tell that there had been any surgery there
8085866 naomi and i were of course overwhelmed when he told us i think its truly a miraculous blessing

8085876 way out of the problem solving it once and for all
8085877 then maybe theres only out there john amp ken and fleischman to do their little spiel and maybe its not enough
8085878 well if this party has a message it has done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
8085879 david gergen said this a short time ago that in the first two hours what is the message
8085880 and you know what david didnt get to where he was in life because hes stupid he was exactly right i look at this and i am about to jump out of my chair theres no message coming out of here there is no sense that the party has a sense of urgency and weve only got four nights this is 25 of the whole thing
8085881 i think the democrats would be better positioned if they put the obama girls on stage for a couple of hours every day
8085882 suppose for example youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom would you vote
8085883 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8085884 infusion of cash from small amounts by internet donors and the explosion of blog sites
8085885 for those of us interested in politics it was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november

8085911 it is impossible to imagine an australian national portrait gallery without a portrait of bradman
8085912 leak included in it a subtle visual allusion to bradmans elegance and effectiveness with the bat during his playing career
8085913 leak is one of our best political cartoonists but in this portrait we see him in serious portrait mode paying tribute to a towering figure in australian sporting history
8085914 they clicked and hit it off instantaneously and we stayed and had a cup of tea and had a lovely afternoon
8085915 they spoke the same language and they sat there and laughed all afternoon and had a really great time
8085916 afterwards my father said to me on the way home well bill that was the best day of my life
8085917 its funny because i was warned that he would be very aloof and that he wasnt a very humorous person and that i might find him difficult and a bit brittle
8085918 but in fact my experience of him was quite the opposite we laughed a lot he told me some very funny stories
8085919 we realised later we missed the chance of course we are angry
8085920 we are decent and treat them well so we left we are not paparazzi
8085921 she was very angry by the sound of her voice when she asked the danish media to leave
8085922 i got the impression she did not want to be hassled
8085923 they got to see lots of things and it was good they were able to have some quiet time
8085924 we have a minnesota museum of american art wheres that

8085929 the audience like a wild colt with a bit between his teeth rose above all cry of order and again and again the irrepressible applause broke forth and resounded far and wide

8085940 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8085941 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8085942 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8085943 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8085944 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8085945 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8085946 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8085947 i started getting hit in the head with the gun and then somebody said he is bleeding
8085948 and when i looked i looked into the barrel of a gun and i tried to run away
8085949 he suffered blows to the head with a police issued baton and a police issued gun
8085950 and he was threatened at gunpoint by these police officers
8085951 theyve been suspended and their weapons have been taken away from them and the investigation continues

8085982 there is only one question in this race which candidate offers the change we need to restore the promise of america
8085983 in 2007 he voted with the bush administration 95 percent of the time only one candidate in the race offers the change we need to restore the promise of america a person of integrity honesty and love for his country barack obama
8085984 hopefully out of this there will be hundreds of women who will take a stand and say yes i can
8085985 i just think thats what our policy is all about inclusion and honoring that inclusion
8085986 and having the leaders of our party step up to the plate and pave that road for other women to get to the top and be in public service and be in public life i just think its a tremendous tribute
8085987 teddy intends to be back in the senate in january

8085989 theyre having a tough time because of rising fuel prices because of the same things that are creating a tough time for individual families that are trying to fill up their gas tank or buy groceries
8085990 he was a picture of confidence but in some ways confidence itself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8085991 i can tell you that i thought joe biden as a selection for barack obama was designed of course to bring foreign policy experience to barack obamas team and his ticket i think it brings experience but if you look at joe bidens record with some 30 years in foreign policy experience theres about 30 years of being generally being wrong on foreign policy issues
8085992 unlike senator clinton i have no kind of ambiguity about my candidate
8085993 she said her candidate is unprepared to be president i announced when i was running that if i wasnt running i would support john mccain so im very enthusiastic

8085997 but dr b told me that we could do it this way
8085998 loving a child is a circular business the more you give the more you get the more you want to give
8085999 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need
8086000 we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8086001 never tapped into our greatest resource the character and resolve of the american people
8086002 its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8086003 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8086004 and do you think that if it happens that obama is elected or even just being nominated will send positive ripple effects throughout the country on the race issue
8086005 listen up you looney tune hypochondriac parent we know you work in special education and thats why youre worried but give the kid a break why dont you lighten up shell start talking if you didnt know so much about the system you wouldnt be here at all go home talk to your kid and dont bother us again with your normal developing very typical english as a second language kid oh and shes super cute extra adorable and a pleasure to work with now have a nice day
8086006 we joked about it because he kept going bigger and bigger over the years
8086007 i kept encouraging miniatures because they were easier to haul around
8086008 it was exactly what he wanted to do and for it to go into his hometown high school was even more special

8086030 we are always concerned about any provision that comes out as inadequate that extra 3 does concern us

8086050 it may have been a church full of pedophiles and criminals covering up other criminals sins it may have been a church riddled with hypocrisy deceit and corruption but our megachurch experience taught us that we were captive catholics

8086052 outside of their own circle theyre virtually unknown but within their ranks they make up an army of bareknuckle brawlers publicly arguing the aesthetic merits of octopus imagery and hairy 70s porn stars theyve created their own visual language for describing the spotty underbelly of western civilization and theyre not shy about throwing it in the face of polite society along the way they manage to create posters that are strikingly obscene unflinchingly blasphemous and often quite beautiful
8086053 the public wants to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities not private firms who may use them inappropriately including unnecessarily snooping on ordinary citizens
8086054 this is a consequence of the governments obsession with policing on the cheap as well as their staggering complacency towards the extension of surveillance
8086055 just shut up and let the beautiful man play beautiful music
8086056 ive been really disappointed with our performances this season and i have told the players that
8086057 i think we need to improve in every area in the second leg
8086058 we were lucky to leave belgium with a 0 0 when you see the goal that wasnt given and the penalty it could have been worse and we were not a threat at all but the positive is that it can be a wake up call the players must understand what a massive game this is
8086059 the first thing is silverware i like to talk about trophies that is the main thing
8086060 but the champions league is also about money and you have to take the two things together but we are here to win titles not to make money i always tell my players that if they win games they win trophies and then they will have higher wages and more money it is the same for the club
8086061 they are well organised they have good players and they have quality it will be a tough game for us because when a smaller club faces a top side they can play without pressure
8086062 that was their best game together so far the understanding between them was much better but the team didnt play well and all the attention went to carra jamie carragher and steven gerrard because of their goals
8086063 you have to put eight british players on the list and we had to decide before the first leg
8086064 so we considered who might be in the final and left javier and lucas out
8086065 well give it our best but if we somehow manage to get through it will rank as the biggest shock by a belgian side in europe for 40 years
8086066 all i keep hearing is how poorly liverpool are playing at the moment but when i looked at the premier league table on saturday night im pretty sure they were top with maximum points thats some poor start
8086067 the greens are very opposed to these painful and sometimes lethal stun guns being introduced into the police armoury
8086068 police are able to draw firearms when they are needed
8086069 the big gap in our tactical options is a less than lethal option that will reliably incapacitate a dangerous offender
8086070 issuing tasers to every primary response police officer would make a real difference to the safety of police the public and even offenders themselves
8086071 it is a reflection of the increasingly serious violence that is being witnessed daily by police and public alike
8086072 however our own survey of police association members in 2005 did not indicate a desire amongst most police to be regularly armed with firearms
8086073 police today are almost more afraid of having to use lethal force than they are of being subjected to it
8086074 how are we going to get out of here at the end of the ride
8086075 hey ladies well let all three of you go again for just ten dollars
8086076 no no thank you we dont want to go again
8086077 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other

8086137 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8086138 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8086139 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8086323 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8086324 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8086325 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
8086326 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8086327 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused

8086338 we agreed that rainbow is an important recreational facility for the top of the south

8086350 the evidence involving the alleged threats does not warrant federal charges now i must tell you though that the investigation is still ongoing and we are all keeping an open mind
8086351 from a legal standpoint the law recognises a difference between what we call a true threat thats one that can actually be carried out and the record racist rantings of drug abusers

8086391 he had tremendous get off he wasnt like a five star recruit but there were a lot of things we liked
8086392 i dont think it was so much him that convinced me to go there sc is a great place and they have great coaching and always have
8086393 i noticed they were on their way up when i was coming in and i wanted to be part of that
8086394 hes a great player who played hard every down with great technique i just vouched for his character and work ethic
8086395 he was a strong player but he benches 510 now and thats off the charts but i was really surprised by his quickness he was a lot quicker than i remembered at sc his lower body strength and his flexibility was better than i remembered
8086396 im smarter than when he first got ahold of me and i was kind of raw ive grown up an awful lot since he last coached me i think his perceptions of me are changing that he realizes that im not 17 anymore and that ive been doing this for a while
8086397 we got sed and bobby and they give us a lot of depth and versatility and were excited about that and coach orgeron is a pass rushing coach so hes teaching us a lot more stuff and weve had a lot more pressure in these recent practices than we had in years before
8086398 very explosive smart player very coachable very nice guy we think hes going to have a big year
8086399 i see a very talented player a very athletic guy
8086400 he has a great attitude a great personality the guy just comes in and wants to go to work he can play the one technique nose tackle or the three technique upfield tackle he has the ability to do both and hes strong enough to do both and i just see great things coming from him
8086401 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8086402 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8086403 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8086404 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8086405 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8086406 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8086407 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8086408 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8086409 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8086410 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8086411 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8086412 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8086413 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8086414 and now everythings changed theres a new coach a new system and were pretty much building a new stadium its not what the michigan people have expected in the past and maybe thats a good thing
8086415 its been a culture shock for a lot of us with everything thats happened here in the past year
8086416 but i think youre seeing a gradual confidence in what were doing here there might be a lot people worried about what might happen this season but i think there are just as many people who are excited about the changes
8086417 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8086418 but sometimes its just weird that your career comes full circle
8086419 he brings us a guy who is still very creative
8086420 hes a great pass receiver and a guy we still think is a heck of a runner
8086421 all i know is i am going to touch the football
8086422 one of the things i wanted when atlanta released me is to be involved this is a fresh start and coach gruden wants to get me involved in both facets the running game and the passing game
8086423 so were really happy to have him back in tampa
8086424 but you can be a good person and help people better themselves in your own way

8086431 well who knows he may be announcing some new intergalactic agreement of some kind or other you never know whats going to come out
8086432 what i would like to see him do is focus on the real economic issues
8086433 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8086434 the objective of good government is for government to raise no more money than it needs
8086435 i think its important from time to time that the prime minister take the opportunity at venues like the press club to outline and update our plans for the future

8086439 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and i guess my point at this stage is we are investigating and i think various people are speculating at what it is but weve had concerns about his behaviour and we are investigating that
8086440 we have a variety of ways we conduct investigations were comfortable with the way we are investigating that
8086441 theres a whole variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly our ethical standards department does an outstanding job
8086442 what people need to understand is that police officers do have discretion many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8086443 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8086444 people have a right to some privacy in policing while we investigate the matter

8086467 the fact that im speaking here tonight is a testament to obamas ability to show respect to those who disagree with him

8086480 every parent wants the most outstanding place for their child and there should be enough to go round
8086481 the proportion of daycare providers inspected with good or outstanding childcare has risen from 53 in 2005 06 to 64 in 2007 08 though the proportion of childminders judged good or outstanding has fallen from 65 to 59
8086482 parents should keep the ofsted reports in perspective its the experience of one inspector on one day and they fulfil an important function in keeping things safe but the school gate and nursery car park are the best places to find out what a nursery is like
8086483 though only a small proportion of childcare settings are inadequate that masks the fact that there are almost twice as many inadequate childminders this year providers judged to be inadequate have significant improvements to make if they are to meet the demands of the eyfs and provide the high quality education and care children deserve
8086484 its heartening that childcare in this country is improving but we want to drive up standards even further that is why we are introducing the eyfs in september which will give every child equal right to the best quality care and learning

8086491 there is no question that we are living in an era of unprecedented demand for minerals and metals
8086492 the government could get to the position of saying that looking at the overall economic development position of the country and the picture on energy use high speed rail is a sensible thing to do
8086493 if growth continues at its current rate then it could well be that we reach growth forecasts for 20 years time in 10 instead in which case all the capacity improvements planned in the rail white paper are exposed a lot sooner than expected
8086494 there is very little evidence that high speed rail links help regional performance
8086495 there is an argument for spending a lot more money on the existing low speed railway service there are not enough people making long journeys for high speed rail to make sense

8086531 i asked head coach marvin lewis to play thursday just to not to prove a point but to show that im ready to go and he told me no
8086532 theres no need i already got hurt in one preseason game theres no reason for another
8086533 ive talked to a lot of people who have played with this injury kellen winslow browns donte stallworth browns maybe about 10 guys ive talked to they didnt get surgery they played and had a successful season so ill be fine
8086534 the hostility i see from the more right leaning libertarians towards obama is bewildering i can understand that you disagree with virtually all of his positions so do i but there are two things to consider here
8086535 obama isnt perfect but hell do better on those two massive issues than any republican besides ron paul would
8086536 thus i suggest that the democratic party is a more natural ally for libertarians right now than the republican party barring some sort of massive sea change within its ranks let the paleo libertarians do what they want they are more concerned with fantasizing about some ideal conservative libertarian society than actually promoting freedom the best they can it seems clear to me that an america under barack obama or perhaps even hillary clinton will be far more free than an america under john mccain

8086541 given the state of the economy the attendance we had at indy tells me that gaming is more important than ever in our attendees lives and that gen con adds a fun and unique experience to everyday life we appreciate the support from all our attendees sponsors and exhibitors who make gen con the show that it is and for that we say thank you
8086542 im looking forward to indy 2009 and another great show

8086544 cog 398 has pulled out from the pack and is in a solo lead with more than 304 hours billed this month will the pack ever be able to catch up
8086545 they began to push us back with their batons and their riot gear and all of a sudden everyone noticed that they were coughing you couldnt smell it you couldnt see it my eyes were running someone literally had to drag me back to in front of the hotel and then we couldnt get in
8086546 the hotel was on lock down the elevators were locked they were telling people that you couldnt leave the shuttle bus over the pepsi center was cancelled
8086547 what was frightening to me if they were supposed to be there to protect i want to know who they were protecting
8086548 this is not my first democrat national convention ive never seen this type of law enforcement presence this is i would say a little intrusive
8086549 i think the force was necessary cause it sends a message to the other protesters theyre just trying to keep the city safe i lived in la during the rodney king riots i just dont want to see that again
8086550 i just think the democratic plan is better than the republican plan i think it would better for me financially if a republican won but that would be selfish
8086551 you come against me with sword and spear and javelin but i come against you in the name of the lord almighty the god of the armies of israel whom you have defied this day the lord will hand you over to me and ill strike you down and cut off your head today i will give the carcasses of the philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth and the whole world will know that there is a god in israel all those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the lord saves for the battle is the lords and he will give all of you into our hands
8086552 my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then my servants would be fighting so that i would not be handed over to the jews but as it is my kingdom is not of this realm

8086559 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8086560 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8086561 one of the most profound and important victories available under our system of justice
8086562 defendants were represented at the supreme court by nine attorneys from three of the nations largest law firms and had access to all the legal resources provided by their own vast governmental budgets
8086563 where the result is especially important and there is significant professional risk to counsel in pursuing the litigation
8086564 if this is not an exceptional case we are at a loss to describe what case would qualify
8086565 the request is made in the good faith belief that the issue requires revisiting
8086566 no lawyer rationally undertakes on a contingent basis work that would yield the same fee for the same work that could be earned without risk of non payment
8086567 we obviously are going to have to look at it closely thats a lot of money this is not a situation where there was a trial everything was done on motions certain kinds of work are recognized to be appropriate and certain kinds are not
8086568 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8086569 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8086570 when they announced the football team i swear the whole gymnasium erupted
8086571 our players came running in and they just couldnt believe how loud everybody was
8086572 i think its really interesting when you find students who have interest in a new venue bringing football back bringing that collegiate experience that you see at many other institutions
8086573 whenever you get a chance to be the beginning of something you have a chance to be remembered for a long time so a lot of our freshmen understand that and want to be a part of that
8086574 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8086576 a man machine interface which provides tactile feedback to various sensing body parts
8086577 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8086578 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8086579 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8086580 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8086581 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8086582 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8086583 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8086584 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8086585 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8086588 however it also confirms that researchers increasingly find what they need through google scholar and other online resources a trend the reports authors anticipate will accelerate as more and more knowledge goes digital but only 48 percent of economists and 50 percent of scientists value libraries as gateways
8086589 das alkoholverbot zu verh ngen ist mir nicht leicht gefallen
8086590 wir machen das nur anlassbezogen zum beispiel beim gr tzinger nachtumzug oder bei das fest
8086591 bisher haben wir zum beispiel in der g nther klotz anlage noch keine gr eren beschwerden in bezug auf alkohol gehabt
8086592 dort ist das trinken ja sowieso verboten weil es eine gr nfl che ist
8086593 das ist f r die einfach zu weit zum hinlaufen und es gibt ja in der n he auch keine versorgungsstation f r alkohol
8086594 wir wollen jetzt nichts beschlie en wenn dann kurze zeit sp ter alles wieder r ckg ngig gemacht werden muss weil die rechtslage vorher nicht gekl rt war
8086595 das wird f r uns ein ganz wichtiger kampf eine niederlage d rfen wir uns nicht erlauben denn sonst haben wir ein problem im zweikampf gegen den tsv abensberg um die ausrichtung der titelk mpfe

8086597 the first round of the google android developer challenge is over and the list of winners has been released congratulations to all the developers of the top 50 applications as some of you already noticed enkin is not one of them we could speculate about the reasons for this but there is more interesting news we have been contacted by google separately and they too are excited about our project so at this point in time there are a number of possibilities for the projects future which we are currently exploring
8086598 i want to be able to honor the public trust
8086599 we want cme to be unbiased and science driven and we dont want it to be influenced by marketing we want our educational activities for whomever we are serving whether its our own faculty or our colleagues in the community locally or globally to be true to the science and the evidence and not be influenced by any kind of financial industry support
8086600 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
8086601 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
8086602 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
8086603 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
8086604 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
8086605 we all agreed it is inappropriate for industry to influence content
8086606 if industry really wants to enhance the education of clinicians they should be given the opportunity to do so
8086607 but we wanted to create a situation in which they had no effect on the choice of topics or their content so were happy to have industry support as long as it is provided without strings or expectations about the course content
8086608 really brings control of cme curricula back to academic medical centers
8086609 one of my hopes is to make stanford a destination so we can hold cme programs here leveraging the wonderful cultural attractions on campus
8086610 i think right now industry is under a lot of pressure in its use of marketing for education theyre re examining their role in cme as well
8086611 as we take this step my hope is that other institutions will start to follow suit i think the climate will change dramatically to enforce that if institutions do not take greater responsibility there is going to be a mandate whether its one that we initiate or one that is imposed that frees up these intertwined interactions of academia and industry around medical education

8086613 the field internship experience provides you an opportunity to put into practice the lessons learned in the classroom most students report that their greatest learning experiences lee county auburn club plans initiative to welcome fans from opposing teams
8086614 and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much thats why i left a job at a law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities
8086615 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8086616 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8086617 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8086618 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8086619 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8086620 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8086621 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8086622 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8086623 ok ok i cant quite make up my mind yet
8086624 oh weve got that on tape lawyers will have a field day with that one
8086625 the ryder cup is at the back of my mind right now
8086626 id love to be on that team darren has put the cats amongst the pigeons by winning and weve got poulter in there its going to be tough faldo is keeping his cards close to his chest
8086627 its been difficult to try to shove that in the back of my mind because it keeps coming up
8086628 it keeps presenting itself to me that i very much want to be on that team so ive always got to try to put it back and concentrate on whats at hand and thats playing good golf
8086629 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8086630 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8086631 this causes of night sweats is a very common occurrence during the menopause transition years and while annoying it is not necessarily dangerous or a sign of underlying disease some women experience night sweats during pregnancy due to hormonal changes
8086632 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8086633 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8086634 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8086635 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8086636 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8086637 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8086638 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8086639 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8086640 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8086641 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

8086647 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8086648 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8086649 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8086650 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8086651 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8086652 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8086653 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8086654 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8086655 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8086656 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8086657 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8086658 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8086659 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8086660 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8086661 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8086662 its a continuation of this trend that eyeballs are going to other places on the internet and advertisers are recognizing that
8086663 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8086664 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8086665 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8086666 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8086667 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8086681 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8086682 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8086683 i dont care for the salesman that sold it to me
8086684 in attempting to exercise his contractual discretion out of spite jerry breached his duty to act in good faith towards the other party to the contract
8086685 if in his good faith opinion it did not fit or was not an attractive jacket
8086686 jerrys post hoc rationalization that he was returning the jacket because he did not want it was rejected properly by bob as not credible
8086687 this case is far from over and obviously the fact that the court of appeals cited seinfeld certainly makes the states highest court a force in the modern legal world
8086688 we are cheerleaders for barack obama thats why we are here
8086689 we cannot allow anyone to divide us when it comes to the general election
8086690 its already gotten ugly the higher barack rises the more mud will be slung they are piling it on even while were here
8086691 our opponents are trying to portray us as different as something to be feared
8086692 grind house and shock cinema hosted by rob zombie 1 of 6 for freestyle collective
8086693 as i think about it i say the more things change the more they remain the same
8086694 im here to join the women as we look and hope and hold hands that all is going to be well and we have a compromise and we all come out of there unified in denver we must do that for the children
8086695 its a wonderful path its taken kind of in my estimation a little bit too long i wish that she could have been a candidate long before now for president or some woman
8086696 part of the problem in the campaign was that they had very similar views on lots of issues and so it wasnt a hard decision
8086697 shes supporting the party shes supporting him if they feel if a person feels that shes the leader that she is and that she has made this decision then honor the party and honor the woman
8086698 if that high wasnt there gustav would have probably just moved north right into the atlantic
8086699 those employees that dont have 10 years in the pretense they were hired under would not be taken from them we were able to hold on to those things

8086706 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8086707 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8086708 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8086709 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8086710 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8086711 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8086712 in some ip boutiques youll have one or two partners who enjoy and are good at doing the administrative work and would perhaps be happy to scale back in client work
8086713 the make up of the people we had was not that way they were much more interested in staying in contact with their clients
8086714 i took the managing partner role as mostly a burden and not as something that was particularly enjoyable
8086715 my preferences were clearly toward serving my clients and that was a big driving force for me
8086716 but that doesnt mean you cant have a litigation practice unless you represent gm or merck
8086717 the ability to get referrals from general practice firms has slowed down considerably
8086718 at that point everyone was talking to other people and we began talking to pat kelly
8086719 since the spring the only people weve talked to are pat kelly and the two other guys
8086720 synnestvedt is the oldest continuously existing intellectual property law firm in the area and one of the oldest in the country
8086721 they bring exceptional experience not only in patent and trademark preparation and prosecution but also in intellectual property litigation
8086722 we are thrilled to welcome a partner of joes caliber to the firm
8086723 his experience will strengthen our existing intellectual property capabilities and will expand the ip services we are able to offer clients
8086724 discussing the possibility of several other attorneys from synnestvedt joining the firm
8086725 it gets us a lot of national tv games and it helps us with recruiting
8086726 sometimes its hard to maintain that level of peak performance from week to week
8086727 we havent won the wac outright in a long time thats one thing wed like to do this year but i think playing the non conference schedule we do the positives outweigh the negatives
8086728 itll be a little different for us we sort of have the reputation for being giant killers so were not going to sneak up on anybody
8086729 what they did in baseball is an inspiration for everybody and hopefully that momentum can carry over but what we do in football is very different for us every game is a one game series theres a lot at stake in week 1 not just for us but for everybody
8086730 i was on the phone and i think pat was making calls at the same time i said are you looking for a game we just worked it out from there
8086731 i think our kids are excited to be playing a good team
8086732 they have some great skilled athletes i think everybody in the country knows the history of fresno state and this may be pats best team in the last 10 years
8086733 i grew up on a big cattle ranch about an hour and a half south of fresno
8086734 thats kind of been put on the back burner now that im playing football but maybe in a few years ill get back to that
8086735 leverage youve got to have your legs under you to rope a calf also from a mental aspect youve really got to have your head in it
8086736 the field internship experience provides you an opportunity to put into practice the lessons learned in the classroom most students report that their greatest learning experiences lee county auburn club plans initiative to welcome fans from opposing teams
8086737 id say this is one of the three best matches of my life
8086738 four years ago sam hit maybe four times a week for an hour or two
8086739 he didnt take it seriously until his parents decided to hire me since that time his development has been incredible
8086740 if i had to pick one major to win this would be the one
8086741 hopefully i can do the best here its nice to get over that first match and there will be less and less pressure the further i go
8086742 its kind of tough because we havent had that the last couple years
8086743 hes 21 in october but developmentally and maturity wise hes like 19 or 20 i feel like he has so much improvement left in him and hes already been ranked in the 30s its all an upside for him hes getting more professional every day
8086744 this lays out the framework for how to do this
8086745 affords the lawyers the ability to reduce their costs and often the cost to the client to the extent that the individuals or entities providing outsourced services can do so at lower rates than the lawyers own staff
8086746 lessen the fear and uncertainty that opponents of this are spreading
8086747 its just preposterous that we have to go to an american law school and pass a bar exam and then see our jobs shipped overseas why even require people to go to law school
8086748 i dont think we have taken any legal jobs away
8086749 weve made the process more efficient but there is still plenty of work
8086750 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8086751 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8086752 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8086753 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8086754 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8086755 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8086756 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8086757 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8086758 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8086759 thats why i dont think this is an overall bad thing
8086760 and i think it also can really help the players become more comfortable in the environment they play
8086761 were more of an international tour now but were an american based tour and the players need the tools to interact with fans and sponsors one of those tools is to speak english
8086762 we are proud to have tournaments in 30 countries and players from over 100 competing in them and have no plans to impose a common language on them
8086763 they may well violate florida discrimination laws because language is a key element of persons national origin people should be judged on their ability to perform a job english fluency has no more to do with the ability to play 18 holes of golf than whether you walk 18 holes or ride 18 holes
8086764 organizations and businesses in general have the right to make requirements on skill sets necessary for their employers
8086765 we as a membership organization have the right to establish obligations that our members must adhere to in order to do the things fundamental to conduct our business
8086766 if there is a language barrier hampering the pro am experience that hurts
8086767 you dont want any barriers when it comes to what the lpga does best and thats to interact with fans sponsors and pro am players
8086768 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8086769 no child no matter how wealthy the parents needs to be provided with more than three ponies
8086770 t he court made no distinction between what needs were reasonable given the age of the children and what simply amounted to a fourth pony

8086784 if we place all the immodesty and promiscuity of the generation and the many sins of the world on one side of the scale and the zionist state on the other side of the scale by itself it would outweigh them all zionism is the greatest form of spiritual impurity in the entire world they are polluting the entire world they have polluted the jewish people with their heresy
8086785 go to reb yoelish he has kol hatorah kulah in his head and knows more than anyone from this generation
8086786 when an era closes there is always a danger that the succeeding generations will be oblivious to the values and special character of their predecessors thus g d often grants one exemplary member of the preceding era longevity to permit him to teach the next generation how the old generation lived by his mere presence thus did rabbi yehudah hanassi who closed the era of the tannaim by writing the mishnah continue to frequent his home for decades after his passing and rabbi yochanan who compiled the jerusalem talmud lived for hundreds of years and thus did the satmar rav grace our generation with a greatness in scholarship and piety that had been identified with the glory of days gone by
8086787 this will be our 90th year of helping texas schools by providing them with book covers and we hope to be doing it for 90 more years
8086788 any questions that you have about our working relationship with austin isd would best be directed to them
8086789 each textbook other than an electronic textbook must be covered by the student under the direction of the teacher
8086790 historically most school districts that i am familiar with have provided book covers
8086791 someone probably passed a law requiring books to be covered and now we the locals are eating that
8086792 we believe the money we were paid by texland was earned for years of hard but ultimately successful efforts on behalf of texland efforts that also benefited pec
8086793 never received another payment from this account or from texland
8086794 to find out payments were actually made from this account without board knowledge and approval is extremely disheartening
8086795 we were not aware of any payments for services to any pedernales officers or directors
8086796 at this point bluebonnet wants a clear accounting of the existing funds and a prompt dissolution of the texland partnership
8086797 i want to know what else theyre hiding from the members
8086798 weve been very thorough and have not found any indication of board approval
8086799 there is still a lot of work to go to discover the entire history of this texland account

8086811 esta futura decis o dos presidentes vai permitir um marco mais institucionalizado para discutir todos esses assuntos que interessam a todos

8086818 i know youve heard me say things in the competitive heat of battle that may cause some of you to have doubts about my support for obama i know that and you know that let me put those doubts to rest im not only going to do everything i can do to elect obama i am going to ask you to help me with all your heart with all your soul with all your energy if you believe in hillary clinton believe in obama support him elect him president
8086819 he was the picture of confidence but in some ways the confidence itself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8086820 and in that speech senator obama left an important point unclear
8086821 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8086822 the confusion here is between john mccain rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on senator obama
8086823 i also know how much i love america i know that for more than two centuries we have strived at great cost and great sacrifice to form a more perfect union to seek with other nations a more hopeful world
8086824 what has always united us what has always driven our people what drew my father to americas shores is a set of ideals that speak to aspirations shared by all people that we can live free from fear and free from want that we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we choose and worship as we please
8086825 stand up for those who work hard and play by the rules
8086826 esta elei o se trata de uma simples quest o n s queremos mais quatro anos de bush mccain ou n s queremos a mudan a que precisamos

8086833 could be why dont you ask them on their myspace
8086834 kotsay covers a good amount of ground in center field he combines good range with good reads on the ball good routes and a strong accurate arm his 18 baserunner kills over the past 3 years 2003 2005 is second only to jim edmonds in center field in that time period
8086835 the people who support hillary when they hear from her i dont think they will have any problem supporting obama
8086836 it is very unlikely i would ever support a democrat for state senator
8086837 the republicans in austin simply havent been effective enough texas really needs new leadership to solve challenges like the crisis in school funding and ethics in state government
8086838 aos 20 minutos de v o o piloto entrou em contato com o aeroporto de nyala para informar que o aparelho tinha sido sequestrado e seguia para tr poli na l bia
8086839 we want the conviction so they will be properly classified
8086840 n o participamos em nada desse sequestro ele completamente contra nossas metas valores e objetivos condenamos esse seq estro a uma s voz
8086841 he was not a blackberry kind of guy said his younger brother joshua goldman a 32 year old hybrid city bus engineer from san diego

8086843 ben had a gift for seeing things the way few of us could said paul mcnab vice president of marketing and corporate marketing organization for cisco
8086844 every problem was an opportunity every roadblock a chance to shine every discouragement a possibility to improve
8086845 for the next 2 hours we went whooping and hollering through the corridors of the pentagon fast i mean fast said his brother michael an allergist from maryland
8086846 youre not allowed to go roller blading in the pentagon

8086854 sempre que n s latinos precisamos de algo bill e hillary estiveram l para nos ajudar por isso os hisp nicos os v em como nosso casal kennedy como jacqueline e john
8086855 para mim essa vota o muito importante porque representa a chance de darmos todo nosso respeito e reconhecimento ao que hillary conseguiu no processo das prim rias
8086856 hillary quer que demos nosso apoio a obama e biden e com pesar farei isso mas porque ela me pede
8086857 para ela a unidade do partido muito importante ouvi a discursar duas vezes e a cada vez ela fala com seu cora o sobre a necessidade de apoiar obama e biden
8086858 possivelmente hillary n o fez tudo o que podia para apoiar obama mas obama tamb m n o a apoiou 100
8086859 n o sei como dizer isso de uma maneira educada mas sempre houve muitos atritos entre os latinos e os afro americanos n o h uma confian a m tua nas cidades sim porque trabalham juntos mas n o no resto do pa s

8086862 the walking blood bank is activated we need blood type a stat
8086863 the county has rules operating rules that form the basis for how they make boundary decisions
8086864 you know i think the press release speaks for itself the only thing i would add is that we respect the judges decision
8086865 so theyre breaking yet another one of their rules in order to hold this revote
8086866 the overarching principle is to hold the school board accountable
8086867 at both sets of hearings each of the plaintiffs themselves and or their spouses personally testified and addressed the school board

8086875 weve offered to help them georgetown strategic capital with outreach
8086876 if they wanted us to help with outreach then we would go out a little more aggressively
8086877 we want to be able to ensure that businesses will have the right tools
8086878 my concern is making sure that everybody has the capacity to compete
8086879 they pacific general are actually working on their business plan which is the best thing to do to start now

8086881 the warehouse loft aspect just doesnt feel right for this area

8086883 i used to imagine that as i got older i would become content able to just relax and coast now it is becoming abundantly clear to me that there will never in my life be a point where i am not stressed and anxious
8086884 i will be satisfied i will feel secure i will stop worrying i will put down my armor

8086887 the project includes replacing the metal decking and fencing improvements to the railings painting of the bridge and railings and installing lighting and a roof over the bridge
8086888 we are still proceeding with our initial plans to construct a miniature golf course were still on that path
8086889 we listened to their the buckingham residents opinion but it did not change the direction of the project

8086892 the beijing games showed chinas strength to the world many foreigners were impressed by the show so its natural that the rest of the world would try to figure out how china would use that strength
8086893 hu has made it explicitly clear that china will never choose the path of confrontation or take a self centered approach instead it will embrace the world and take part in a rule based global competition
8086894 by hosting the olympics china has shown the world its strength and status
8086895 the hu lee meeting a day after the closing ceremony of the beijing games once again brings home the urgent need for wisdom and historic vision from our leaders
8086896 you can save quite a bit by going from a 250 to 1 000 deductible

8086898 i have shown you many good works from the father for which of them are you going to stone me
8086899 it is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy because you being a man make yourself god
8086900 is it not written in your law i said you are gods 35 if he called them gods to whom the word of god came and scripture cannot be broken 36 do you say of him whom the father consecrated and sent into the world you are blaspheming because i said i am the son of god 37 if i am not doing the works of my father then do not believe me 38 but if i do them even though you do not believe me believe the works that you may know and understand that the father is in me and i am in the father

8086902 why then say the scribes that elias must first come

8086908 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench
8086909 he has been a consistent champion of reproductive choice and will make preserving womens rights under roe v wade a priority as president he opposes any constitutional amendment to overturn the supreme courts decision in that case
8086910 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla

8086914 he is incredibly smart and he is very able to deal with a strong woman which is one of the reasons why he can be president because he can deal with me

8086930 we want cme to be unbiased and science driven and we dont want it to be influenced by marketing we want our educational activities for whomever we are serving whether its our own faculty or our colleagues in the community locally or globally to be true to the science and the evidence and not be influenced by any kind of financial industry support
8086931 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
8086932 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
8086933 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
8086934 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
8086935 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
8086936 we all agreed it is inappropriate for industry to influence content
8086937 if industry really wants to enhance the education of clinicians they should be given the opportunity to do so
8086938 but we wanted to create a situation in which they had no effect on the choice of topics or their content so were happy to have industry support as long as it is provided without strings or expectations about the course content
8086939 really brings control of cme curricula back to academic medical centers
8086940 one of my hopes is to make stanford a destination so we can hold cme programs here leveraging the wonderful cultural attractions on campus
8086941 i think right now industry is under a lot of pressure in its use of marketing for education theyre re examining their role in cme as well
8086942 as we take this step my hope is that other institutions will start to follow suit i think the climate will change dramatically to enforce that if institutions do not take greater responsibility there is going to be a mandate whether its one that we initiate or one that is imposed that frees up these intertwined interactions of academia and industry around medical education

8087016 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
8087017 they had used the wrong name on the document so i insisted that they correct the name before they could take her away i reminded them that they had to bring her home within the stipulated 12 hours
8087018 she told them that it was not illegal to take photographs in a public place and she had not visited any secret areas or military installations they had no legal basis for holding her
8087019 i cant say whether their intention was to intimidate but if they can do this to an influential writer who has done nothing more than take photographs then one can only imagine the kind of threat that ordinary people in tibet must feel every day
8087020 long live the peoples republic of china down will with all tibetan independence elements

8087023 with the exception of the nightly newshour it has become a generalised entertainment format to have showgirls to seduce the audience
8087024 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8087025 at times there are terrible programmes in say britain or spain but at least viewers have a richer variety of shows to choose from
8087026 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8087027 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8087028 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8087029 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8087030 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline
8087031 just like christopher columbus who didnt invent america but discovered it all ive done is make veline visible theyve always existed

8087040 you can buy our game disc and when their instruments break buy ours
8087041 i am delighted to have this opportunity to exhibit in city space and to display my paintings together with the drawings i produce for the pas alongside the objects featured in the exhibition
8087042 im excited that people can get to see up close some of the amazing artefacts im lucky enough to record seeing them on our website is one thing but dont miss this opportunity to admire the craftsmanship first hand
8087043 we welcome ebays assistance in helping stop the illegal sale of antiquities on the internet with this partnership our experience is that most people who buy and sell uk archaeological finds do so without being aware that they may be breaking the law if items have not been reported we have therefore worked with ebay to ensure that its users are aware of its obligations through our guide we will also be contacting sellers to ensure that they have reported items and have appropriate documentation
8087044 for those who are selling items illegally this partnership means we have in place a process to stop listings and take action against the individuals concerned doing so is vital because such activity is not only illegal but could also damage the archaeological record as without effective reporting valuable insights into our past could be lost forever
8087045 ebay is one of this centurys greatest success stories a truly global phenomenon but like us they recognise that the expanding internet trade in art antiquities and antiques has potential for abuse and it is important that steps are taken to ensure that it does not unwittingly become a cover for criminality i commend ebay for taking such a responsible stance
8087046 educating our customers on what to look out for when buying antiquities on ebay and informing sellers of their obligations is of paramount importance giving our customers the knowledge and engaging that knowledge to help with our investigations work means we have 15 million pairs of eyes and ears out there working with us on a day to day basis working with british museum and pas and harnessing the strength of our community of buyers and sellers means we have an extensive network to ensure that antiquities are sold legitimately it is also an excellent example of the way that ebay can work with law enforcement to track people seeking the break the law and bring them to account
8087047 this is a really good example of the art market and those concerned in the preservation of antiquities working together to help prevent and detect cultural property crimes we are fully supportive of the initiative and hope that it has a real impact on preventing illicit sales

8087060 yes we have settled the issue of the authority of scripture in our confession that battle is over and done however i believe that the battle for the authority and sufficiency of gods word is never really done it is as old as the garden of eden and will continue until jesus comes back as we can see southern baptists pastors are overwhelmingly inerrantists but they are also discerning enough to know that we must always be on guard against compromise and error

8087089 our husbands decided to stay in the village with the children
8087090 after harvest we sold the produce in the market and bought cattle
8087091 we came to addis ababa expecting to get a better life
8087092 sometimes the residents give us some food but sometimes we sleep hungry
8087093 one reason for the urban food crisis is the huge gap between demand and supply
8087094 the demand is increasing beyond expectation while the supply is less
8087095 increases in staple food prices are coming at a time of already high and extreme levels of food insecurity in some regions
8087096 at the same time livestock prices and labour rates have increased only minimally further reducing the overall purchasing power of poor and very poor households
8087097 when local production fails to feed the people one looks at global markets
8087098 but despite ethiopias move to import food from the international market the prices are still not affordable to urban dwellers
8087099 the global situation has affected the response not the problem
8087100 the problem remains the increasing population and poor farming methods there has to be emphasis on helping people to recover
8087101 previously farmers brought their products and sold to wholesalers without prefixed price
8087102 now unless they get a buyer at their price they wait for a good offer
8087103 is added to the n series you can keep the exposure in a dark situation night time or indoor as long as you wish it gives the picture a sense of motion the holga is now sort of a pinhole camera detailed instruction is in the menu
8087104 change their all sales are considered final as per rules of ebay
8087105 83 percent of internet users in that age bracket ages 10 to 14 spent an hour or more online a day but only 68 percent devoted that much time to television
8087106 change their all sales are considered final as per rules of ebay in the event of u p s damage it is your responsibility to square trade protection on many of our listings united states

8087108 i plan on continuing gymnastics to beat shannon millers medal total at worlds
8087109 i just want to thank god and jesus and my family and all of the fans for their support i want to thank my coaches and my competitors for a good match
8087110 it is better to keep your mouth quiet and let people think you are stupid then it is to open your mouth and prove you are
8087111 so is pommel horse a problem well yes but what the selection committee undoubtedly saw was that even though artemev led the horse standings even with three out of four falls he also only averaged a 14 83 less than four tenths better than morgan with only a single score breaking the 15 mark for his lone hit which went 15 65 so while artemev could have theoretically added 1 35 to the team total there was only a 25 percent probability of that occurring based on his nationals and trials results and a far better shot that hed bring three tenths or less to the table if he continued to struggle the fact that artemev was also wildly inconsistent on his other events meant those were odds the selection committee didnt want to bet on
8087112 crazy you were two competitions away from completing your dream
8087113 xxx has experience at worlds and international judges just like her
8087114 the thing is like many games you need to ignore the grognards because they love the game so much they kill it and nail it down under a nice piece of glass where it can stay pristine and untouched
8087115 canon is whats been established until a better idea comes along
8087116 mahatma gandhi dont go to the new delhi meeting i have some friends and i have heard there is danger
8087117 i am mr john i am a rich man i am this i am that
8087118 these divisions are everywhere because they are created by god
8087119 what do you mean is this a vedic injunction that i have to follow you without any argument
8087120 narayana the supreme personality of godhead is beyond this cosmic manifestation
8087121 that supreme personality of godhead narayana is krsna he has come as the son of devaki and vasudeva
8087122 if you travel at this speed for millions of years youll find that the spiritual sky is unlimited
8087123 the actual aim of vedic research is to find out krsna
8087124 krsna govinda has innumerable forms but they are all one
8087125 i am the compiler of vedanta and i am the knower of the vedas
8087126 now he owes you what the chinese sifus japanese senseis and jedi knights refer to as a life debt
8087127 the theme of the democratic convention is unity unfortunately they cant agree on how that works
8087128 detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick will not be going to the dem convo yeah having some problems
8087129 this thursday barack obama is gonna give his acceptance speech and reportedly its going to include performances by bon jovi and bruce springsteen yeah and they say obamas not black enough
8087130 of course obamas supporters got him his usual birthday gift of gold frankincense and myrrh
8087131 well you know at the democratic convention this week in denver both bill and hillary will be speaking not to each other of course
8087132 joe biden is barack obamas running mate yeah nothing says change like a guy whos been in the senate for 35 years
8087133 as you know john mccain is an older white haired man who has been in the senate for over twenty years voted for the iraq war and said barack obama did not have the experience to be president im sorry thats our intro for next week when joe biden is on i got confused
8087134 yeah the democratic convention is in denver and security is tight out there it is very tight its tighter than nancy pelosis face
8087135 and barack obama now says he is open to offshore oil drilling so apparently when he promised change he was talking about his mind i guess thats what that was
8087136 the democratic national convention continued in boston as rising star barack obama wowed the crowd with the best keynote address in recent memory obama was so impressive the partys considering having him give john kerrys concession speech
8087137 the democratic national committee released its lineup of the politicians that will speak at the convention and hillary clinton is not on the list but today bill told her dont feel bad none of his other women are speaking either
8087138 did you see any of that convention oh my god wow for that kind of excitement you had to go back to the gore lieberman era
8087139 how many of you saw john kerrys acceptance speech its the first time hes ever said i do and didnt get any money
8087140 at the convention john kerry showed up with all his vietnam crewmates and not to be outdone next month at the republican convention george w bush is going to show up with all his college drinking buddies
8087141 did you see john edwards speaking his speech was so dull that teresa heinz kerry told him to shove it
8087142 edwards speech was so good when he finished the delegates awarded him 80 million plus punitive damages
8087143 the democratic national convention gets under way this week in boston which is tragically preparing for its turn at the national stage by the way all the security isnt to keep people out its to keep people in during hillarys speech
8087144 a citizen defined in simple terms is someone who can participate in judging that is serve as juror in court system and in governing that is serve public office not just magistrates but also serving in the assembly and on the council in systems of government that have these institutions
8087145 the system of the government of a city state is the arrangement of its various institutions especially those having authority in a democracy the people have the authority
8087146 where the substance of the source language text is retained but the form is changed
8087147 where the translator produces a poem of his own which has at least only the title and point of departure in common with the source text
8087148 in those instances where a local ulster word seemed either poetically or historically right i felt free to use it
8087149 the local term seemed in each case to have special body and force
8087150 to try to preserve for the reader what the translator takes to be the most striking characteristic of the style of the original extraordinary richness of rhetorical elaboration alternating with often combined with the barest simplicity of statement in order to reproduce this effect it has seemed best to translate as literally as possible confining oneself to the linguistic and intellectual structure of the original
8087151 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
8087152 i will soon be born in mathura to lighten the oppression of the earth
8087153 how is it that he is so talented how does he know the stories so well no one has explained all these details to him
8087154 arjuna said you are the supreme brahman the ultimate the supreme abode and purifier the absolute truth and the eternal divine person you are the primal god transcendental and original and you are the unborn and all pervading beauty all the great sages like narada asita devala and vyasa proclaim this of you and now you yourself are declaring it to me o krsna i totally accept as truth all that you have told me neither the gods nor the demons o lord know thy personality
8087155 by concentrating ones attention on the transcendental form of krsna who is all pervading and beyond time and space one becomes absorbed in thinking of krsna and then attains the happy state of transcendental association with him
8087156 visnu is one and yet he is certainly all pervading by his inconceivable potency in spite of his one form he is present everywhere as the sun appears in many places at once
8087157 devotional service of the lord that ignores the authorized vedic literatures like the upanisads puranas narada pancaratra etc is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society
8087158 no one can understand krsna as he is by the blunt material senses but he reveals himself to the devotees being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto him
8087159 unless you are bodily stout and strong you cannot achieve spiritual salvation you must be very strong and stout and eat meat and fight and then youll get next spiritual birth
8087160 we are independent we can find out the solution of the problems of life by material adjustment
8087161 without the mercy of balar ma you cannot understand you cannot realize your spiritual identification
8087162 my dear son what you have learned the best thing from your teachers
8087163 real solution of problems of life is to get out of this material condition that is best thing in my opinion
8087164 my dear vai ava h kura kindly accept me as your dog as your dog i am dog already but i am m y s dog im not vai avas dog so kindly accept me
8087165 only nity nanda can make me happy otherwise not possible
8087166 kindly keep me under your shelter so that i am very du k i am very unhappy under the shelter of your lotus feet i shall be happy
8087167 o lord shiva you once told me that one should avoid speaking with pasandi atheistic demon and that doing so is worse then talking to candalas outcastes please tell me of what are the symptoms of such persons and what signs do they wear on their bodies
8087168 the devas said o kesava only you can conqeur these great demons who cannot be conqured by all of the gods and who have washed off their sins with penance
8087169 hearing the frightful words of the demigods lord vishnu purushottma consoled the devas and said to me o rudra o you of might arms o you who are the best of the gods for the purpose of deluding the enemies of the demigods prepere a course of conduct to be followed by pasandis
8087170 through devotion to me and for the good of the world you should approach atheistic sages such as kanada gautama sakti upamanyu jaimini kapila not to be confused with kapila the son of devahuti durvasa mrikandu brihaspati bhargava and jamadagni
8087171 taking to these doctrines all of these demons will become averse to me in a moment
8087172 o beautiful one after hearing lord vishnus words although i am a good speaker i become helpless snd silent then offering my obeisances to lord vishnu i said o lord if i do what you have said it will certainly lead to my destruction it is is not possoble for me to carry out this instrustion yet your order is not to be disobeyed this is very painful
8087173 o goddess hearing my words vishnu spkoke in such way to restore my happiness
8087174 all of the sinful rections due to wearing ashes and bones will all be destroyed and everthing will beacome auspicious due to reciting my mantra
8087175 o auspicious one for the good of the gods i took to the way of the pasandis and started wearing skulls hides ashes and bones
8087176 receiving boons from me they became intoxicated with power and pride
8087177 o goddess thus this behavior of mine is only followed by me for the good of the gods following lord vishnus order i decorate myslf with ashes and bones o goddess these external marks are meant only for deluding the demons in my heart i always meditate upon the supreme lord vishnu and always chant his mantras by chanting this great six syllable mantra i taste the eternal nectar of ecstatic joy o lady with an auspicious face i have answered all that you have asked me affectionately i ask you what else do you desire to hear
8087178 o sinless one tell me about the tamasic scriptures that were composed by the brahmanas bereft of devotion to the lord o lord of the demigods please tell me their names in sequence
8087179 mayavada or advaita philosophy is an impious wicked belief and against all the conclusions of the vedas it is only covered buddhism my dear parvati in kali yoga i assume the form of a brahmana adi shankara and teach this imagined philosophy
8087180 this mayavada advaita philosophy preached by me in form of adi shankara deprives the words of the holy texts of their acutal meaning and thus it is condemned in the world it recommends the renunciation of ones own duties since those who have fallen from their duties say that the giving up of duties is religiosity in this way i have also falsely propounded the identity of the supreme lord and the individual soul
8087181 in order to bewilder the atheists in kali yuga i describe the supreme personality of godhead lord gauranga krishna to be without any form and without qualities
8087182 similarly in explaning vedanta mahashastra i described the same non scriptural and inauspicious mayavada philosophy in order to mislead the entire population toward atheism by denying the personal form of my beloved lord
8087183 the thing is like many games you need to ignore the grognards because they love the game so much they kill it and nail it down under a nice piece of glass where it can stay pristine and untouched
8087184 canon is whats been established until a better idea comes along
8087185 the pure vedic upanishads according to shakaraacharya reveals no indication of a need for ritual or worship or anything remotely like what you suggest is part of the path to brahman all worship is nonsense irrespective of the religion only an egotistic human being could conceive of a creator that required worship of any kind
8087186 the absolute truth is described in the upanishads and brahma sutra but one must understand the verses as they are that is the supreme glory in understanding
8087187 sripada sankaracarya has described all the vedic literatures in terms of indirect meanings one who hears such explanations is ruined
8087188 sankaracarya is not at fault for it is under the order of the supreme personality of godhead that he has covered the real purpose of the vedas
8087189 according to direct understanding the absolute truth is the supreme personality of godhead who has all spiritual opulences no one can be equal to or greater than him
8087190 everything about the supreme personality of godhead is spiritual including his body opulence and paraphernalia mayavada philosophy however covering his spiritual opulence advocates the theory of impersonalism
8087191 the supreme personality of godhead is full of spiritual potencies therefore his body name fame and entourage are all spiritual the mayavadi philosopher due to ignorance says that these are all merely transformations of the material mode of goodness
8087192 sankaracarya who is an incarnation of lord siva is faultless because he is a servant carrying out the orders of the lord but those who follow his mayavadi philosophy are doomed they will lose all their advancement in spiritual knowledge
8087193 is impious asac chastra it is covered buddhism my dear parvati in kali yuga i assume the form of a brahmana and teach this imagined mayavada philosophy in order to cheat the atheists i describe the supreme personality of godhead to be without form and without qualities similarly in explaining vedanta i describe the same mayavada philosophy in order to mislead the entire population toward atheism by denying the personal form of the lord
8087194 in kali yuga mislead the people in general by propounding imaginary meanings for the vedas to bewilder them
8087195 my dear wife hear my explanations of how i have spread ignorance through mayavada philosophy simply by hearing it even an advanced scholar will fall down in this philosophy which is certainly very inauspicious for people in general i have misrepresented the real meaning of the vedas and recommended that one give up all activities in order to achieve freedom from karma in this mayavada philosophy i have described the jivatma and paramatma to be one and the same
8087196 those who fix their minds on my personal form and are always engaged in worshiping me with great and transcendental faith are considered by me to be most perfect
8087197 if it is indeed true that the one undivided brahman whose very nature is pure spirit is the foundation of maya and also embodies the liberating force of knowledge then it is illogical to say that the very same brahman falls under mayas influence and is covered by ignorance thus we can understand that the jiva and the supreme lord are separate entities since both their identities and capabilities are different the jiva and the lord are essentially distinct
8087198 not even a thank you clearly i caved in too quickly on letting you live
8087199 please let me go this must be some mistake im nobody important oh god please dont kill me
8087200 were bad guys you know this youve seen us rob banks hold various nations hostage kidnap heads of state threaten to blow up the moon and so on

8087203 you think i can help you get him out i cant i mean i run a homeless shelter
8087204 did you ever wonder where we all got these crazy powers
8087205 an them damn fool heroes all freakin angels lucky bastards
8087206 angels are spirits that want to do good and demons are spirits that want to do bad thats clear enough right so what happens when an evil spirit gets into the body of an evil person
8087207 the rider i got in me shaklakar the potent used to have ghengis fucking khan as a host rampaged across asia and europe leaving piles of heads and thousands of rape victims behind him sure ive burned down a few forests i killed the last lesser spotted prairie chicken kept the eastern seaboard browned out for three days but i dont think theres anything on my conscience to compare with the golden horde
8087208 we recruited him after he was forced off the force for whistle blowing like you he was a normal every day good person
8087209 i used to teach in an inner city high school
8087210 im a genius who invented a super sonic plane that runs on water along with a material stronger than diamond flexible as tissue and selectively adherent depending on what kind of electrical charge you run through it with a few patents i could be a multibillionaire and then go about undermining small african nations for my personal amusement or or funding genocides or making nukes for nuts if i wanted to efficiently maximize my production of human suffering what have i done instead the chicago giggles plague holding americas highways hostage cmon
8087211 i killed stanwick rider got the better of me that day no way out
8087212 but the rest of those feds just got shot in the legs talked it into that told it theyd suffer longer and slow down the rest of the pursuit
8087213 you have to walk that line keep your demon entertained it loves death and sadism and carnage but sometimes even more it loves spectacle if youre flamboyant enough you hardly have to kill anyone at all
8087214 some dont care some dont know some dont believe they aint the real problem anyhow
8087215 theyre not the real problem are people who have demons and get along with them just fine theyre the ones who dont dress up dont take wildly evocative names dont rob armored cars with their bare hands or steal the liberty bell
8087216 or people who fought the good fight cagers like us but went over the edge
8087217 theyre covering it up but those lightning league pussies couldnt stop him before he wiped out a couple hundred civilians hell they wouldnt have even caught him if null here hadnt shot him in the back with that bazooka
8087218 so you want me to to be like you a host for a demon parasite
8087219 if youre wearing that itll draw doomslaughters spirit when it gets loose
8087220 wait i thought you said doomslaughter was imprisoned trapped beneath the earths crust you said it was a prison that no one could escape
8087221 thats flat impossible but if we destroy the whole place hell die
8087222 you were expecting a no one defies the villainous nine speech nah we have to leave right now to kill our old pal
8087223 of course if you dont put the fucking necklace on who knows what kind of host doomslaughters familiar is going to find they arent perfect judges of character but ol doomy was a philanthropist surgeon who left a lucrative boston practice to take penicillin to kids in the congo and
8087224 you fools just worship govinda and that bhagavad gita spoken by narayana himself
8087225 it is not the personal krsna to whom we have to surrender ourselves utterly but the unborn beginningless eternal who speaks through krsna
8087226 you intellectual fools just worship govinda just worship govinda just worship govinda your grammatical knowledge and word jugglery will not save you at the time of death
8087227 we are always in competition for formats but we have a relationship that has worked to the benefit of both we are very very confident that this will continue
8087228 except for the lotus feet of lord nityananda there is no other shelter
8087229 the whole world is suffering under the blazing fire of material existence therefore if one takes the shelter of the lotus feet of lord nity nanda
8087230 if you are anxious to go back to home back to godhead and become associate with r dh and k a then the best policy is to take shelter of nity nanda
8087231 one who has not been able to contact nity nanda then one should think of himself that he has simply spoiled his valuable life
8087232 that nonsense does not know that what will his education and family and tradition and nationality will help him
8087233 oh what is nity nanda what can he do for me i dont care
8087234 it is not false because nity nanda is eternal his lotus feet is also eternal
8087235 my dear lord i am very unhappy so you please make me happy and you kindly keep me in corner of your lotus feet
8087236 that person who recites these twelve auspicious holy names of the moonlike nityananda chandra every day upon arising in the morning
8087237 such a person becomes free from all difficulties amp attains all their most cherished desires very soon they become the object of lord mercy
8087238 lord nityananda is full of good qualities nitai gunamani means the jewel all good qualities he says this repeatedly
8087239 if both of us remain here then who will preach in bengal
8087240 gfk was all set for a nil premium merger with tns until sorrell barged in and changed everything gfk needs time to realign its troops
8087241 this takes time and we are not in the easiest climate at the moment we are in talks with serious and important investors and these talks are progressing very well we will make an announcement at the right time
8087242 gfk is actively pursuing a proposal which would involve an alternative all cash offer being made for tns with the involvement of an identified potential source of equity and equity related financing
8087243 gfks original statement regarding the financing of a bid for tns should have been modified to clarify its situation

8087255 im going to talk about the american dream one i have lived and one that he has lived
8087256 im going to talk about the need to restore the faith in that american dream
8087257 no one would have ever anticipated the unlikely ascent of barack obama to be the democratic nominee for president of the united states
8087258 no one would have anticipated that i would serve as a united states senator given the fact that we were so poor that we didnt have telephone or electricity on our farm
8087259 those possibilities could only happen in this country thats what makes for me personally this election so exciting
8087260 two parallel lines meet somewhere in infinity and they believe it
8087261 its all about keeping food from going into the trash
8087262 also its about feeding people food is a life force people are hungry and stressed this gives them a needed little pick me up
8087263 two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them their children their country how many
8087264 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8087265 never tapped into our greatest resource the character and resolve of the american people
8087266 get us off foreign oil to stop funding the very terrorists who had just attacked us
8087267 every american would have said how can i do my part
8087268 this administration failed to believe in what we can achieve as a nation when all of us work together
8087269 i bet you obama doesnt have 30 percent of voters undecided in illinois
8087270 joe biden is the most qualified person to serve as vice president
8087271 there was only one small problem there was no gavel
8087272 this is an issue i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8087273 it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it catholics who make excuses for it fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of their catholic faith
8087274 it seems to be the litmus test for being a catholic
8087275 a vote for obama and biden is a vote to sustain legalized child killing
8087276 the police are enforcing the laws of obstructing traffic yet they wont enforce the laws against the killing of children
8087277 i chose to come and pray as a witness to the sanctity of life
8087278 but i choose not to be arrested because of other responsibilities i have in my parish
8087279 this isnt a political protest this is a human issue a civil rights issue
8087280 i think weve really fallen down on the job in the last eight years

8087285 she broke so many stereotypes she broke the notion that woman could not do this
8087286 over her career she has offered me my daughters and all of our daughters a different vision for what they could become and for that we are forever grateful for her work
8087287 work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8087288 i know a little bit about how the white house works and you know if the president is not exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama we are going to have somebody to answer that phone
8087289 it was beautiful and really classy and it shows we can come together as a party to elect barack obama
8087290 wake up america the insurance companies took over health care
8087291 up with peace up with prosperity up with the democratic party up with obama

8087293 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8087294 my job is to get the defense to play hard to get the most out of them thats all on me it always has been so i remember looking at my mom right after she said that to me
8087295 this was my mom my family telling me my players didnt play very hard it hit home i told myself that from that day forward whatever we do we can play with effort and we can play with physical and mental toughness regardless if we execute i tell the players all the time that the effort is on you and the execution is on me
8087296 we have really adapted to it were taking it full steam ahead coach he demands excellence and we have to get there we have to meet him with his enthusiasm and everything in his coaching ability because he comes hard
8087297 im not proud of that moment and ive stopped swearing since then well im working on not swearing
8087298 seriously im not proud of it how do you go home and explain that to your 6 year old
8087299 my dad used to always tell me that 10 percent of life is what happens to you
8087300 the other 90 percent is what you do with it you can break your leg and have the woe is me poor me attitude about life or you can roll up your sleeves put on a hard hat and go to work you can adjust adapt and move on i always choose to move on
8087301 it was just another setback another thing to work through so i did
8087302 he intercepted the ball and ended up fumbling on the play
8087303 it actually was todd helton who plays for the colorado rockies now people dont remember but he was the tennessee quarterback before manning but yes i did fumble
8087304 i didnt have as much experience as the other coaches i was going against but i knew i could outwork everybody
8087305 i just figured that coaching was all about working hard preparing and relating to people thats really what this business is about relating to your players
8087306 i mean he was about the same age as me and never had coached in the nfl i was really surprised because i would have run through a brick wall for him after about a week hes got this infectious personality hes intense but hes also honest and sincere and you just dont want to disappoint him
8087307 both my parents died months apart from each other when i was there and coach muschamp was the one i turned to to help me through everything hes going to succeed at texas his passion becomes your passion his intensity becomes your intensity
8087308 there is an intensity there thats hard to describe but its there because of muschamp
8087309 the spirit of the league was community family well being nurturing its an extended family and its been disrupted
8087310 you know the goal i set for myself this year was to have a healthy training camp
8087311 ive got to do a good job of being a good leader and bringing the younger guys along
8087312 i think youve got to approach each game the same and go out and play the game and do the best you can do to help the team win part of that includes helping the younger guys and bringing them along
8087313 he makes all the calls he is the quarterback of the offensive line and does a great job
8087314 nowadays defenses are made up of a bunch of guys who can move pretty well and are not that big if somebody wanted to line up and pound the ball i think theyd have a chance to have a little bit of success
8087315 we can still run the football plus have the flexibility of better passing its the best of both worlds
8087316 i hope not i dont want to have to face it
8087317 moi pas question que je regarde a tout coup que a me donnerais des envies sp ciales dorgies
8087318 tujuh puluh enam orang semuanya warga sipil dan kebanyakan mereka adalah wanita dan anak anak telah dibantai selama operasi oleh pasukan koalisi di distrik shindad provinsi herat
8087319 19 wanita tujuh laki laki dan selebihnya anak anak di bawah umur 15 tahun
8087320 for it is generally assumed that as the first african american president he will face a higher than average risk of assassination
8087321 this man just took my chair knocked into me look at this
8087322 i am a clinton delegate and these obama delegates are mistreating us
8087323 alabama i guess i just have this feeling that there is lingering prejudices there but maybe thats totally unfair on my part
8087324 theres no place like home and home and home and home
8087325 for generations of americans owning a home has been a piece of the dream yet today that dream has become a nightmare for millions of families perched on the edge of foreclosure
8087326 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8087327 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8087328 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8087329 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8087330 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8087331 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8087332 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8087333 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8087334 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8087335 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8087336 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8087337 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8087338 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8087339 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8087340 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8087341 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8087342 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8087343 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8087344 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants to be president
8087345 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8087346 there was insufficient evidence that the statements of the suspects constituted a true threat
8087347 they get goodwill they get access and they build relationships
8087348 theyre covering all bases theyre making sure they have input with whoever wins
8087349 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8087350 what the exception says in essence is lobbyists cannot buy influence by paying for a lavish party to honor one member
8087351 i know a little bit about how the white house works and you know if the president isnt exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama and were going to somebody who answers that phone
8087352 just remember this over the last eight years youve been falling behind
8087353 over the last eight years your lives are less secure
8087354 a bunch of meth heads put together i dont know what they do
8087355 there is no credible threat right now and there was no credible threat
8087356 could not believe how close he obama was to becoming president
8087357 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8087358 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8087359 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8087360 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8087361 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8087362 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8087363 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8087364 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8087365 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8087366 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8087367 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8087368 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8087369 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8087370 i know has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and john mccain for president
8087371 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8087372 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8087373 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8087374 i think that its something that at times the media tried to make more of
8087375 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups

8087379 let me be clear weve conducted an intensive investigation chased down numerous leads and carefully reviewed the evidence to date
8087380 reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time and they cannot independently be corroborated
8087381 the evidence involving alleged threats does not warrant federal charges but the investigation is ongoing and we are keeping an open mind
8087382 what matters at this moment from a legal point of view the law recognises a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the racist rantings of drug users

8087390 i heard ponting being interviewed on the wireless one day it was after the india test at the sydney cricket ground where they disgraced themselves and all that baloney and i heard him say no im not going to tell my players what they can say
8087391 i thought god strike me that would be the equivalent of field marshal montgomery calling his colonels together on the night before the battle of el alamein well boys weve got rommel tomorrow at el alamein do it your way and ill see you at the finish
8087392 people have been a little bit askance about bradman they talk of him being unapproachable and so forth it wasnt the case
8087393 im certain i never queried him on it but he wouldnt say to a player later on when he was a selector look billy i think youre not travelling well it might be because of so and so that wasnt his go
8087394 but all you had to do was say can you help me hed bend over backwards then

8087404 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region
8087405 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
8087406 evacuations could begin as early as wednesday there is no impact on production at this time
8087407 if gustav is able to thread the needle passing through the yucatan channel into the gulf of mexico it could intensify to category 4 or 5 strength over the warm water in the gulf

8087470 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par

8087481 my purpose is to reach out to democrats and to make sure that we convey the message to them that john mccain will work for every vote and that john mccain looks forward to receiving the support of not just republicans but democrats and independents
8087482 i was pleased yesterday in a press conference to introduce four people who have been active in the democratic party who are now supporting john mccain
8087483 while party is very important the country comes first they see john mccain as a man who puts his country first they saw this person in hillary clinton they saw judgment and experience in hillary clinton and they see those same things in john mccain
8087484 a party doesnt own your vote a candidate does not own your vote and as a citizen you can choose to place that vote wherever you feel will serve your country best its motivating people to move toward john mccain
8087485 i think its particularly important for women to recognize that no one owns their vote but them they are now 52 of the voting public they are not a contitutency they are a majority

8087487 pro life and pro choice women are casting their vote whatever you think about reproducive rights or life that is only one issue among many
8087488 women are a political force economic force they start small businesses at twice the rate of men women do in fact care about the economy national security energy independence education and health care
8087489 as a majority and as key leaders in the family and the nation women need to stand up and cast their votes
8087490 the people who i have been talking to for many months are not swayed by the choice of joe biden to vote for barack obama

8087493 yes and no this is getting into the area of his triune nature the one feature that separates the true god from all other gods is his ability to violate the law of non contradiction jesus as god sacrificed himself to his father who is god this is the way it went down before heaven and earth were even created god requested a volunteer and jesus stepped up to the plate

8087540 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8087541 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know

8087561 this is really good news for me and my team i hope we will all be able to play in good style against manchester and achieve positive result
8087562 if i had thought like that in 2004 i would have left after two matches

8087588 we released chris henry and we wish him well we do not know what the future holds for chris and this organization either individually or cellectively but today we are moving in this new direction toward this future

8087648 ya tuhan kami janganlah engkau hukum kami jika kami lupa atau kami tersalah ya tuhan kami janganlah engkau bebankan kepada kami beban yang berat sebagaimana engkau bebankan kepada orang orang yang sebelum kami ya tuhan kami janganlah engkau pikulkan kepada kami apa yang tak sanggup kami memikulnya beri maaflah kami ampunilah kami dan rahmatilah kami engkaulah penolong kami maka tolonglah kami terhadap kaum yang kafir
8087649 iya ga berasa udah berjalan sampe disni kalo diliat yang kemaren kemaren gak nyangka aja bisa melewatinya setiap jalan terjal yang bikin sakit kaki itu selalu ada persimpangan kadang persimpangan itu ada dua tiga empat lima bahkan sangat banyak sampe bingung mana yang musti di tempuh and voila im here now ternyata bisa lewat juga ya ga kebayang aja kok bisa ya
8087650 and how do you feel are you fine with where you are at now
8087651 hidup itu selalu seperti itu jalannya ga selalu lurus ada saatnya dia penuh dengan persimpangan artinya tuhan selalu memberikan beberapa pilihan kadang pilihan itu tidak terlalu sulit sudah ada rambu rambu informasinya tapi adakalanya pilihan pilihan itu gelap ga ada petunjuknya dan pilihan pilihan itu seperti memakan buah simalakama tapi pasti ada pilihan terbaik dari semua pilihan terlihat tidak baik itulah gunanya allah menurunkan perintah istikharah ketika berhadapan dengan hal yang seperti ini
8087652 iya ya dan sepertinya allah sudah mendeasin setiap orang dengan sebuah rute perjalanan masing masing ketika jalan itu bercabang dia sudah mempersiapkan resiko di depannya di setiap cabang masing masing adakalanya kita salah pilih jalan kejeblos dengan lubang tapi dalam kesalahan itu allah juga selalu memberikan beberapa pilihan jalan kembali bisa jadi ada jalan untuk keluar dari lubang itu atau bisa jadi malah semakin terperosok selalu ada pilihan tinggal kita mau tidak berusaha membaca peta dan petunjuknya
8087653 iyalaah inget ga perjalanan madinah mekkah jalannya luruuuuuuusss nyaman sih tapi bikin ngantuk nyetir bahaya kalo ngantuk nah coba bandingkan kalo nyetir di bogor udah jalannya naek turun belok belok banyak angkot pulak mana sempet ngantuk kewaspadaan lebih meningkat
8087654 emang lagi ada di jalan yang bercabang berapa sekarang hueheheheh
8087655 yaa at least kan biar allah selalu kasih sign supaya jalannya ga gelap gelap amat kalaupun bercabang atau lurus lurus aja
8087656 its ok god i can handle it dont need anything from you at the moment
8087657 ya tuhan begitu banyak keinginan di hati ini hamba begitu menginginkan ini dan itu lirik my wish list di postingan bawah tapi engkau yang maha tahu apa yang terbaik untuk hamba engkau yang lebih tau apakah keinginan hamba ini menjadi sesuatu yang baik atau buruk untuk hidup hamba maka hamba pasrahkan segalanya kepadamu ya rabb

8088393 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8088394 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8088395 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8088396 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq

8088398 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8088399 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8088400 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8088401 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8088402 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8088403 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8088404 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8088405 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8088406 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8088407 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech

8088416 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8088417 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8088418 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8088419 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8088420 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this

8088455 barack obama knows that the most important barrel of oil is the one that you dont use
8088456 the petrol dictators will never own american wind and sunshine

8088508 we put our time and hearts into this to come through and finally win the gold medal not just for ourselves but for america it means a lot
8088509 it means everything to me its so rewarding to see your hard work pay off
8088510 they countered our game plan by making some incredible plays every possession counted if it wasnt for our determination we wouldnt have pulled it through
8088511 dwyane made a couple big plays and we all know kobe likes the ball down the stretch
8088512 we played well we almost had it we fought to the end we had a chance
8088513 that probably goes down as one of the greatest games in olympic history
8088514 all three of us took time out and took the moment in being part of the 04 olympic team and not getting to show our talent we really wanted to win this
8088515 what you saw out there was a team coming together and playing as a team
8088516 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
8088517 has been circled on my calendar for about two years now
8088518 weve got veterans were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last three years getting ready for this moment
8088519 so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
8088520 we were not looking ahead i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
8088521 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things the main thing was just to keep some consistency so overall i was very pleased with tonight
8088522 i think we have to adjust to being spot up shooters all of us were not acclimated to being spot up shooters so thats something we have to tweak a little bit and get used to
8088523 we shot 45 percent from the 3 and we shot close to 80 from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that
8088524 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws well its going to be tough to beat us
8088525 it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champions
8088526 my man gave me the ball i had to take the layup
8088527 they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did
8088528 they sent a message to everybody in the tournament they didnt do it before and now everybody knows that theyre for real and theyre very serious about this
8088529 the seller agreed to sell the property at the current market price

8088589 on monday bill clinton gave the opening remarks at the at the federal level clinton offered 10 recommendations to ease us into a green economy pass a price on carbon via a cap and trade system i tried the carbon tax once it didnt work for me tax credits to purchasers or producers of clean energy with at least a 6 10 year time frame modernize the electrical grid both its efficiency and its carrying capacity make mandatory federal policy rather than left to the states accelerate replacement of incandescent lights with florescent and raise appliance efficiency standards fund research and deployment of carbon capture and sequestration we cant afford not to try to do this accelerate the move away from corn ethanol to more sustainable biofuels clinton said corn ethanol plants can easily be modified to produce cellulosic ethanol a claim many biofuel opponents would contest implement a national program to shut down all urban landfills and use the organic material for waste heat or fertilizer accelerate the shift to hybrid electric vehicles and modernize rail networks demonstrate to the rest of the world that this is not an affectation for rich countries that its just as big an opportunity for developing countries this list was followed by another list for states and another for ngos but by that point most people including your humble reporter who has as high a tolerance for wonkery were having trouble staying focused clinton finished with what he called a big idea that could grab the publics imagination organizing to make one entire country or u s state completely carbon neutral reliant only on self produced renewable power and efficiency it would rock the world overall the opening night of the summit from reids introduction to clintons speech to the q amp a was a strangely muted affair with little sense of excitement or momentum perhaps things will pick up today

8088601 by a 2 to 1 decision the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit yesterday struck down an epa rule exempting major industrial polluters from accurately measuring dangerous emissions the rule specifically prohibited permitting authorities predominantly state agencies from including stronger air pollution monitoring requirements in permits for approximately 18 000 major stationary pollution sources even where needed to guarantee compliance with emission limits this is a huge victory for everyone who breathes said earthjustice attorney keri powell who argued the case in court we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air the court ruling impacts emission monitoring requirements for thousands of facilities subject to title v operating permits the decision means that enforcement agencies can now look forward to regular access to reliable monitoring data demonstrating whether large factories power plants cement kilns incinerators and other facilities are polluting the air illegally

8088743 am i not allowed to give my opinion on other peoples value i do have the right to express my views
8088744 i merely touched on existing norms norms that are not set by me why must certain personalities be so fearful of such norms being mentioned
8088745 mobilising ghost writers on a massive attack on me would not cleanse ones misdeeds or change the norms

8088747 let their hollowness be revealed such ugliness is very much part of the real world
8088748 this person had made a moral mistake and apologised to the family and the world if his wife and family can forgive him who are we not to let the delegates decide who they want
8088749 the upcoming party elections should not be filled with accusations
8088750 i do not dare decide or judge someone elses morality except my own can you give me a leader that scores a 100 mark in morality
8088751 i am confident of my capabilities but i have to study the men and see if they are ready for a woman leader as 80 of the central delegates are men
8088752 i hope my resignation made on moral grounds will serve to be a lesson to not just mca members but to all the barisan nasional component party members as well that those who commit offences and possess certain weaknesses must be responsible for their actions
8088753 i thought that by my admission the people would forgive my weaknesses but i thought wrong this shows that honesty does not always pay but it is up to the public to judge me

8088756 it is important for him or her to be free of any political blackmail to speak up effectively for the community
8088757 you as a leader cannot be held to ransom by your opponents how are you going to talk about the communitys affairs if you lack moral standing
8088758 we are not electing a saint so why so much fuss about the moral background of a person
8088759 they often cited suka sama suka meaning they believed it was consensual sex
8088760 or theyd say she was ripe for the plucking one said the victim was manja acting cuddly and pampered with me but that was the rapists granddaughter
8088761 some believe rape is where force was used so having sex with the victim isnt rape to them they are ignorant that rape is also caused by persuasion coercion manipulation and relationship power between an older person and a young victim
8088762 i must admit it was depressing entering a prison but we prepared ourselves mentally and emotionally each time we set off we could not show our feelings and kept cool at all times
8088763 even so i could not help feeling heated during one interview
8088764 similarly a 55 year old who raped his teenage neighbour as his wife had reached menopause stated nak tidur bantal pun sampai kita pun tidurlah want to sleep and the pillow is here may as well sleep on it
8088765 it was hardest to speak to people who had abused their positions of power like a religious head who raped the teenage girls volunteering to serve in the temple under the full trust of their parents
8088766 a music composer convicted of statutory rape against his teenaged stepdaughter passionately declared i am a lover not a killer
8088767 he said his stepdaughter is a hot blooded teenager who needed to be taught the right way to enjoy sex
8088768 most of them had a propietary attitude of shes mine anyway
8088769 what can we learn from augustines understanding of history in light of the fall of rome
8088770 r esisting altogether any notion of earthly perfection augustine offers instead a complex moral map that creates space for loyalty and love and care as well as for a chastened form of civic virtue
8088771 this world is not my home im just a passin through
8088772 in so many of our societies side by side with material prosperity a spiritual desert is spreading an interior emptiness an unnamed fear a quiet sense of despair from the forlorn child in a darfur camp or a troubled teenager or an anxious parent in any suburb or perhaps even now from the depth of your own heart there emerges the same human cry for recognition for belonging for unity
8088773 a new age in which hope liberates us from the shallowness apathy and self absorption which deadens our souls and poisons our relationships
8088774 similarly if you are to know what you think and what you might worship you need to tune in to the conversation that others have had youll end up thinking something youll end up worshipping something but the study of philosophy and theology puts you in touch with people now and in earlier centuries with whom you can speak if you listen only to yourself you will find yourself imprisoned if in isolation you try to worship the god within you will end up only worshipping yourself meaning and purpose are transmitted through communities of experience and reflection only silly people think that religion is what a person does with their solitude the privatisation of religion is part of the privatisation of all experience in our postmodern culture religion is essentially social and people find their space within a sharing of insights and possibilities that extend across the centuries the business of thinking within an extended community of thinkers about the conditions of our life and the possibility of god is i think liberating and fulfilling
8088775 instead of searching for simple explanations we need to find more complicated ways to explain our most familiar events the meanings of words like feelings emotions or consciousness seem so natural clear and direct to us that we cannot see how to start thinking about them
8088776 when our protests against war segregation and social injustice do not reach beyond the level of a reaction then our indignation becomes self righteous our hope for a better world degenerates into a desire for quick results and our generosity is soon exhausted by disappointments only when our mind has descended into our heart can we expect a lasting response to well up from our innermost self if any criticism can be made of the sixties peace protest movement it is not that protest was meaningless but that it was not deep enough in the sense that it was not rooted in the solitude of the heart when only our minds and hands work together we quickly become dependent on the results of our own action and tend to give up when they do not materialize in the solitude of the heart we can truly listen to the pains of the world because there we can recognize them not as strange and unfamiliar pains but as pains that are indeed our own that we can see that what is most universal is most personal and that indeed nothing human is strange to us there we can feel that the cruel reality of history is indeed the reality of the human heart our own included and that to protest asks first of all for a confession of our own participation in the human condition there we can indeed response because out of an inner solidarity with our fellow humans the first attempts to alleviate these pains can come forth it is this inner solidarity which prevents self righteousness and makes compassion possible

8088778 progressive employers are investing in training that encourages their staff to stay calm and confident read the signs of agitation and have clear exit strategies they ensure that detailed records on clients are kept and shared and risks assessed all incidents are reviewed and approaches planned staff have access to technology such as alarms and monitoring systems
8088779 when is something going to be done to protect workers in children services we are told not to go out alone if there is a potential for violence but how many times due to staff shortages have we taken the chance if it was a police officer would they go out alone
8088780 managing conflict is essential training for any isolated worker as is appropriate lone working policies and procedures the real danger is when a violent aggressive incident arises out of the blue
8088781 the people who you see on doubled up visits have usually done or said something to warrant joint visits it is sometimes impossible to gauge that you are walking into a high risk situation if you have had no warning that a service user is relapsing for example
8088782 it is long past the time for society to acknowledge that those of us who work in the social care profession have the right to go about our duties without the fear of abuse and assault
8088783 self defence training could do more harm than good if it increased confidence without developing skills to a level where they would be useful in real life
8088784 you will see on my link that there is a very dangerous woman who is loose in our town who has severe mental illness she has jumped people stabbed people threatened her mother but she still manages to sneak by the cops and denies treatment right now she is homeless and could be anywhere hiding out ready to pick fights with people i have posted as many flyers video warnings what else can i do the cops cant do anything

8088787 do you have any suggestions for social workers who are concerned about clients stalking them a few days ago a colleague was telling me of her experience of being stalked by an ex client i started searching the web for good resources and most of the stuff out there is for victims of domestic violence not the practitioners who work with them it occurs to me that in the increased dialogue about social worker safety these days stalking is an issue thats not being addressed
8088788 id caution you to be very careful indeed about letting your clients track you down like that

8088815 we know that gangs exist for varying reasons some driven by drug dealing some by geographical territorialism and some for mutual protection therefore different local problems demand differing local solutions we have seen a litany of whitehall led initiatives to tackle gang related violence from the violent crime reduction act gang and gun summits in no 10 the tackling gangs action programme and this weeks youth crime plan whilst these have undoubtedly highlighted some of the real issues around gang violence they have not promoted greater local flexibility to tackle local problems by giving elected council leaders control over local neighbourhood policing communities would have a direct say over where gang related issues are tackled and how successfully police are in stopping it
8088816 top down responses and nationwide crack downs on youth crime can do little to address the underlying drivers of gangs and their criminality local multi agency frameworks are key to addressing gang violence we know that effective solutions must simultaneously deliver a range of interventions across education health policing youth work community engagement economic development regeneration skills and training and family support all tailored to the specific communities and context in which different gangs operate this puts local authorities firmly on the front line in tackling this issue bringing partners together under a common vision and coordinating services across an area

8088820 prudential borrowing would support lower interest debt than the markets can support with mortgage defaults up 17 this year and likely to top 100 000 supporting those areas hit hardest could be vital to sustaining communities government should set 2bn of its 50bn intervention package aside for supporting these measures and allowing the hardest hit councils to apply for funding this could help up to 15 000 people out of difficulty and even provide a long term profit to the treasury
8088821 the census has been around for two hundred years and it is no longer gathering the right sort of data for modern public services we are left in a situation where not only does central government not know where it should distribute grant but local councils do not have the information or flexibility to work out where best to spend money to tackle worklessness and crime or to gauge where future demand will be for care homes and schools
8088822 it is time for the government to scrap this outdated method nlgns proposal would make the most of the incredible amount of data already collected drive joined up services across government and save significant sums of money over the long term

8088849 records are very powerful promotional tools to go out and be able to play on the road but you do have to think about it as a way of sustaining itself at some point im very excited about being able to do some of that on my own maybe
8088850 its up to the guy who runs big day out isnt it if he wants to book us were available for weddings and bar mitzvahs itd be nice to come down again i like that festival
8088851 were currently trying to do the big day out thing thats definitely on the cards as long as all the logistical stuff happens well be out there in january were looking forward to it
8088852 with system we played the big day out festival twice and we also played some of our own shows on off days of the festival
8088853 right now we are working it into our plans as we would love to come back down there in your summer and play the big day out again we have our people talking to their people and i can promise you this if it can be done it will be done
8088854 after our shows in august we already want to come back in the summer and play the big day out festival because i hear so many fantastic stories about that tour from all my friends in other bands so we are talking to people about it now
8088855 are we likely to see you back here for the summer for a festival like the big day out
8088856 whens it on next january yeah probably i think thats what were looking at
8088857 being able to find three earth mass planets around a single star really makes the point that not only may many stars have one earth but they may very well have a couple of earths
8088858 so far weve found jupiters and saturns and now our technology is becoming good enough to detect planets smaller more like the size of uranus and neptune and even smaller
8088859 what is amazing to me is that for thousands of years humans have gazed at the stars wondering if there might be another earth out there somewhere
8088860 now we know enough to say that earth like planets are indeed orbiting many of those stars unseen perhaps but there nevertheless
8088861 detecting earth in reflected light is like searching for a firefly six feet from a searchlight that is 2 400 miles distant
8088862 i think why astronomers are really excited about the super earth discovery is it just shows that technology has really matured and so theyre able to see these very subtle wobbles due to these low mass planets
8088863 those were fairly massive stars if they were able to get the same precision on a lower mass star they would be able to look at even lower mass planets and so those really would be analogs of the earth
8088864 i think the real opportunity there is to study low mass stars and thats because were looking for very small planets
8088865 the difficulty is the ratio between the planets mass and the stars mass or the planets size and the stars size depending on how you want to find it
8088866 a late m star is about 10 times smaller than the sun
8088867 so earth going in front of an m star would give a 1 percent signal thats like jupiter going in front of the sun
8088868 we could conceivably find an earth analog planet by this method within the next five or ten years
8088869 we are looking for twins of the earth analogs that walk and talk and smell like our own earth
8088870 i suspect there are earth like planets with lakes and rivers and waterfalls and deep glacial gorges and that are spectacularly beautiful
8088871 when we say its a habitable world all were doing is saying it potentially could hold life
8088872 to go beyond that to say heres a habitable world is it inhabited then you need to start studying the atmosphere of the planet
8088873 there might be a signal in the atmosphere that could be a smoking gun and would suggest that plate tectonics is there
8088874 challenger draws upon the initial 1970 model as the icon of the series
8088875 the 1970 model is the most sought after by collectors but instead of merely recreating that car the designers endeavored to build a challenger most people see in their minds eye a vehicle without the imperfections like the old cars tucked under wheels long front overhang and imperfect fits

8088909 moreover braille keypads and labels are static they do not provide accessible and independently usable sequential computer screen instructions to guide a blind customer through a bank transaction as a result blind customers basically have little choice but to rely on others to do their banking for them
8088910 our nations capital should set the example for the nation to follow by being fully accessible to persons who are blind or otherwise disabled
8088911 it is distressing to know that the only atms available in such national treasures as the smithsonian are inaccessible to the blind it is equally troubling that a company like diebold which manufactures and sells voice output atms that can be used independently by the blind has chosen instead to install machines in rite aid stores that rely solely on screen text prompts
8088912 to make the necessary technological modifications to their atms to allow access by persons who are blind or visually impaired
8088913 the bottom line is that the technology exists to make these atms fully accessible
8088914 unfortunately the defendants are installing atms that are inaccessible to the blind even though the cost for voice output atms is negligible and providing them would not fundamentally alter the nature of atm services or retail drugstore facilities
8088915 instructions and all information for use in atms be made accessible to and independently usable by persons with vision impairments
8088916 moreover braille keypads and labels are static they do not provide accessible and independently usable sequential computer screen instructions to guide a blind customer through a bank transaction as a result blind customers basically have little choice but to rely on others to do their banking for them
8088917 we have tried negotiation and tried urging the regulators and it hasnt worked today we are asking the court to make the requirements of the law plain
8088918 our nations capital should set the example for the nation to follow by being fully accessible to patrons who are blind or otherwise disabled
8088919 it is distressing to know that the only atms available in such national treasures as the smithsonian are inaccessible to the blind
8088920 the bottom line is that the technology exists to make these atms fully accessible
8088921 unfortunately the defendants are installing atms that are inaccessible to the blind even though the cost for voice activated atms is negligible and providing them would not fundamentally alter the nature of atm services or retail drugstore facilities
8088922 diebold firmly believes its products meet current federal guidelines regarding access for persons with disabilities diebold actively promotes a wide range of solutions that help consumers access and use its products
8088923 diebold is committed to work within any and all legal requirements to help consumers access its products
8088924 to make the necessary technological modifications to their atms to allow access by persons who are blind or visually impaired
8088925 instructions and all information for use in atms be made accessible to and independently usable by persons with visual impairments
8088926 moreover braille keypads and labels are static they do not provide accessible and independently usable sequential computer screen instructions to guide a blind customer through a bank transaction as a result blind customers basically have little choice but to rely on others to do their banking for them
8088927 chevy chase bank will continue to pursue technologies that make banking services more convenient and accessible to all consumers and would be pleased to work with representatives from the national federation of the blind in this regard
8088928 we strive to meet if not exceed the ada standards wherever we do business
8088929 we are not prepared to have these machines and others like them established throughout the u s in a continuing pattern that prevents an entire class of people from having the opportunity to do the same kind of business and banking as the rest of society

8088954 i am very familiar with andrew after having him play for me in two previous years
8088955 i know what he can bring to the team andrew is a very talented and smart soccer player he was a major factor in leading us to the western conference finals in 2003
8088956 very excited to have a player of c j s caliber associated with the seattle sounders we are very fortunate to get c j because he should be with mls because of c j s commitment to finish his education at the university of washington we were able to secure his rights for the 2005 sounder season
8088957 i am incredibly excited to be staying in the seattle area and to be getting the opportunity to play with a great team and great friends
8088958 this is a great opportunity for c j to get a feel for the professional game he has untapped potential that we are looking forward to seeing
8088959 i have watched him play over the last three years i like his style of play and i know he will fit in well with my offensive minded strategies
8088960 its great to have our leading goal scorer back for another year welton can make the difference in big games and he was sorely missed in the final match in 2004 we look for great things from welton again this year

8088983 new zealand attracted us as it had so many elements within a single country and it didnt disappoint we were exposed to fiords glaciers volcanoes geothermal activity whales and wine regions
8088984 the country is pure and beautiful fragile is some parts and immensely strong in others the friendly and content kiwis love their country and openly share this with their visitors

8088993 as you begin to eliminate your need for perfection in all areas of your life youll begin to discover the perfection in life itself
8088994 because ive got ugly legs and theyre white as snow
8088995 well first off youre never going to get sun on your legs if you wear pants everyday and second if people dont like the way your legs look they dont have to look at them look at marge the barge across the street she doesnt care
8088996 well when i first got the jeep people started waving at me and so i just waved back
8088997 nawwhh you dont have to do that ill be okay i dont want you to waste your day at the beach
8088998 awwh its alright we are working down the beach dredging this is more fun than that
8088999 child when i was your age i had to walk to school 8 miles up hill in the snow both ways
8089000 how hard can it be to just figure it out
8089001 recently i was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook off the original person called in sick at the last moment and i happened to be standing at the judges table asking directions to the nearest beer wagon when they asked i was assured by the other two judges native texans that the chili wouldnt be all that spicy and besides they told me i could have free beer during the testing so i accepted
8089002 i feel better than ever im excited ive got a whole new look on life i look at life on a whole nother radar
8089003 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check
8089004 i have complete faith that with the lords blessings this surgery will eliminate the cancer from my body and ill soon be back on the road doing what i do best
8089005 i guess he just like freaked out and hit his head johnson said tuesday to a crowd of thousands in her first appearance back to her hometown
8089006 they had to take him to the hospital for stitches
8089007 its been really weird and compared the chinese media to the american paparazzi
8089008 im motivated to do very well here and for the rest of the season
8089009 part of the original deal with les was that the council owned the apartment and rented it to him and a couple of things came up that changed the situation
8089010 a board member raised the question as to whether it would be proper for the council to continue to own the property given the fact that he had not been president for five years
8089011 i said look i dont want any questions to be raised about this why dont i just buy the apartment
8089012 its not a large apartment has kind of a small dinning room and a small living room and i dont know whether there are two bedrooms or three but theyre rather small what i really like is that they like it
8089013 the apartment itself is not large my wife did not want a large apartment and neither did i i basically wanted a terrace
8089014 do we have cable cause if we have cable and were not watching tv were losing money thats just simple economics
8089015 i went through practice the last two days and everythings fine
8089016 hes been full speed here so i dont see a great falloff
8089017 we did the two minute drill today and i didnt feel like i got winded very much so im happy with it
8089018 hopefully i can go out there and put on a show
8089019 weve done drills a hundred times a bunch of different ways keeping a bunch of different extras at different positions
8089020 i just hope all that stuff sifts itself out i have a decent idea but i just want to get another look at a bunch of these guys
8089021 ron powlus played his way on the team at quarterback out in philadelphia in one of those preseason games
8089022 yeah ive seen guys step forward and say hey we cant deny that guy that guy is giving a great accounting of himself you know thats all they want they just want an opportunity to be able to show as long as theyve been given a chance
8089023 we might get a chance to play them down the road
8089024 that would be good to see i hope they do play a little bit so we get a little bit of an extra scouting report on them but i would assume that they wont watch hard knocks hbo series on dallas cowboys training camp and theyll let you know
8089025 tyrell has done a great job of stepping in and filling that void
8089026 having that veteran experience is always a plus with madieu but tyrell has been playing like a veteran he hasnt been shaken at all by getting out there and being in the starting lineup and we expect him to play as though he is a starter and when madieu comes back its going to be an extra plus to have another guy that can be a starter too
8089027 because ryan needs some more work he needs a couple of kickoffs he needs some field goals
8089028 he hasnt missed a field goal and hes been consistent with his kickoffs both distance wise and hang time wise so hes put some good repetitions on tape
8089029 made progress in some of the things that were doing maybe it hasnt shown up statistically especially in the punt return game but weve made progress up front in our blocking both in kickoff returns and punt returns
8089030 i just think our guys understand better conceptually what were trying to get done with the return game and with the coverage game we probably have better athletes doing that
8089031 i think you need about two thats my opinion but well see if that gets changed
8089032 hes looking pretty good out there right now meyer said
8089033 you know our stance around here youve got to be ready to play if hes ready to play hell play
8089034 there is much more sophisticated use of new media by the democrats that is a lesson
8089035 i have not been invited and if i was it would not be to my taste
8089036 this is my seventh convention and it seems to me that the influence of money is enormous
8089037 the lesson for britain is get rid of the union support and lord ashcroft and get pounds 100 from each member of the public
8089038 he has the chance to get us in and out of plays hell have that all year
8089039 so i was a little critical and i was certainly hard on those guys in meetings but they have certainly been impressive so far
8089040 the guys that were veterans in this program have stepped up the first two to come to mind are rashaun greer hes had a very good camp hes been terrific and dion morton last spring i wasnt sure how hard they would play
8089041 we kind of know what were going to do on third down and we know what we are going to do when we get into the red zone and those type of things
8089042 well have the what if list if they are just dumping a bear front and start pressuring us if for some reason they go to a 3 4 defense we know exactly what were going to
8089043 the states interest is served by making the statement that this kind of material is not appropriate to display to minors and what happened in this case was not appropriate
8089044 but also this particular defendant is deserving of a plea in abeyance treatment she has had no criminal history whatsoever and is doing good positive things in her life
8089045 the reason she has struggled with this is at no time did she offer this material to these kids
8089046 were trying to get money as soon as we can in our clients hands
8089047 as we have stated consistently like everyone involved in the tragic valdez accident exxon mobil is anxious to have the matter resolved
8089048 we approached the plaintiffs legal representatives with an offer to pay the punitive damages awarded by the supreme court on june 25 less certain costs and amounts relating to earlier settlements with former plaintiffs the amount agreed with the plaintiffs is approximately 383 4 million
8089049 its a damn small bone for an old angry dog is what it is
8089050 its a mere aggravation for a corporation as wealthy as they are
8089051 its not at all likely to deter them from future environmental degradation
8089052 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8089053 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8089054 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama
8089055 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8089056 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8089057 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8089058 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants barack obama to be president
8089059 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8089060 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8089061 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8089062 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8089063 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8089064 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8089065 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8089066 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8089067 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8089068 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8089069 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8089070 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8089071 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8089072 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8089073 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8089074 bisa saja pks berkoalisi dengan partai lain kalau dengan pdip saya agak sangsi karena dulu pks dan pdip berseberangan kalau berubah tentu akan merugikan citra pks sendiri
8089075 there is much more sophisticated use of new media by the democrats that is a lesson
8089076 i have not been invited and if i was it would not be to my taste
8089077 this is my seventh convention and it seems to me that the influence of money is enormous
8089078 the lesson for britain is get rid of the union support and lord ashcroft and get pounds 100 from each member of the public
8089079 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
8089080 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
8089081 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
8089082 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
8089083 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
8089084 were here to tell the democratic leadership that its not okay to ignore 18 million voices
8089085 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8089086 school is about to start and i was thinking about how i was going to get malias books and locker combination
8089087 work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8089088 she couldnt just walk into the convention hall without being a distraction
8089089 has been more gracious forthcoming and helpful to me over the last several months than hillary clinton
8089090 weve seen it coming its been the market for the last year
8089091 were seeing a lot more traffic through open houses on weekends were seeing a lot more calls coming into the office
8089092 some of the best deals you could get in real estate are around here
8089093 im out just looking and getting ideas of whats out there and i do think time is on our side
8089094 well just keep looking and try to find something that fits a little better
8089095 we want the 18 million hillary voters to be recognized and honored and an open roll call is the best way
8089096 she gave real hope to women for the first time in my lifetime half the population was represented
8089097 i would never vote for a republican but i could stay home
8089098 weve got to get a democrat in the white house so people can have health coverage
8089099 im so excited to be able to vote for her
8089100 it honors all the women who fought for equal rights for equal pay and for the vote
8089101 we call these people reagan democrats or the white working class clearly some are not going to vote for obama
8089102 america has never been afraid of the future and we shouldnt start now
8089103 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8089104 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever because he thinks americans overall are better off thanks to president bush
8089105 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8089106 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8089107 the bush mccain republicans inherited the strongest economy in history and drove it into a ditch we cant afford four more years of deficit and debt drift and desperation not four more years four more months
8089108 over the last eight years your lives are less secure those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did
8089109 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8089110 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8089111 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8089112 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8089113 and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8089114 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
8089115 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states of america
8089116 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8089117 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8089118 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8089119 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted
8089120 its nice that youve made their day by bringing back memories of the home theyre ready to go back to
8089121 i think its sensational youve got to understand man and dogs go back 10 000 years
8089122 thank god they werent my dogs because they would have been all over me
8089123 its extremely rewarding a lot of people in nursing homes dont have visitors the dog is sometimes the only company they get
8089124 tobys visit means more to them than just a dog coming into the room
8089125 n o pode comentar sobre a obra em especial at que seja objeto de compreens o acad mica e de an lise cient fica conclusiva
8089126 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain

8089145 sharp dagger like pains in my eyeballs and the dehabilitating joint pain and the numbing chills
8089146 im scared the guy is going to start howling at fire trucks and ambulances when were out how do you explain to someone why your buddy is urinating on a fire hydrant
8089147 the man has stated to us that he thought he might be allergic to his dog as he only recently started to sleep with the dog his concern was with the fact that he could not get the dogs fur off of his face in the morning
8089148 i work for the police thankfully after knowing this guy for so long all the outrageous events that i respond to are nothing compared to what he has put me through
8089149 remorse no but i have a buddy whos got a dog and id be concerned if i was him about leaving those two alone in the same room

8089293 id have come out of it if i had been conscious enough to wonder if i was hallucinating
8089294 is like a giant vaccuum cleaner sucking is what it does
8089295 dont question me in my own dimension you impudent twit why are you here what are you doing who let you in
8089296 im either dead or on my way to the office of the supreme ruler of the multiverse
8089297 and what the hell do you mean who let you in its free space
8089298 its nothing of the kind its my space my own personal space and youre invading it you and all your tiny friends
8089299 what do you mean have you seen others like me
8089300 no theyre tinier than you and they have no tails and theyre not lizards but theyre horrible horrible fellows them and their black suits bringing explosives into my dimension only time i was happy to see them was when one of the fools somehow got here without that little black box ur wearing he wouldve imploded but i decided deaths too good for him hes stranded on a planet which acts as a central septic drain for 13 galaxies
8089301 hmm dont suppose youd be able to take me to him
8089302 why are you a friend of his are you trying to rescue him
8089303 actually i want to ask him a few questions and then probably throw him into a nova or something
8089304 ho ho ho there are no novas here my son everything here is peaceful dreamy when stars go to rest they dont make any vulgar explosions taking planets and systems with them they just quietly fade and to go sleep with dignity youre a long long way from home
8089305 clearly where i am from i have never seen any dignity in death although many do still hold some delusions similar to what you just said
8089306 life is like a date with a pretty chick a goodnight kiss could seem like the end of the evening but if youve played your cards right it could be just the beginning
8089307 these things just come to me and i say them most of the time i figure out what they mean only after theyre out of my mouth
8089308 possibly it means the whole point of life is death thats what makes it so precious so urgent so important to live it properly while its there
8089309 hahaha oh immortal are you and what do you think that means
8089310 it means i have no natural death if i die it shall be unnatural because i was clumsy or because i was killed in combat
8089311 so you believe all those are unnatural deaths do you you from your planet of wars what could be more natural for you than to be killed in a skirmish no my trespassing friend everything that is dies and that is natural what is unnatural is immortality i oughta know im immortal too or rather i should say im immortal and youre not youre just more resilient than others
8089312 just because im a loony old fart doesnt mean i never make sense
8089313 but i am by nature never clumsy and i am yet to see anyone capable of taking me on in a fight so my death would be rather unnatural
8089314 tell me more about these other intruders youve been having
8089315 those explosives theyve been carrying through here theyre been using them on my planet and this device that was taken from one of them weve found from it that the intruders are being deployed from the office of the supreme ruler of the multiverse
8089316 oh my hahaha what a preposterous idea supreme supreme ruler attacking a plent with soldiers armed with explosives and this is this is why youre going to the offices of the supreme ruler to confront her about her little pranks
8089317 oh yes did you not know that the supreme ruler was a female
8089318 well no surprise then since you really dont seem to know a dimes worth about her anyway
8089319 ill tell you whats funny the idea of the supreme ruler the supreme ruler of the multiverses sending out emissaries to take out a single solitary little planet
8089320 youre on thin ice old creature i suggest you tread carefully what is funny about that
8089321 the supreme ruler is a being who creates dimensions on a whim she could erase you your people your planet your entire plane of existence as if they had never been just by thinking it so if you do ever get to meet that divine being at all after you have given her the laugh of her lifetime she will ask you what in the name of the all covering mist you were thinking so let me give you a chance to practice what you will say tell me my rash young friend what in the name of the all covering white mist are you thinking
8089322 i ill know what to say when i see her
8089323 how long do you think i shall be here in your dimension
8089324 until youre ready to meet her i suppose i think the real reason you had to pass through here is so you could get a few facts straight before you rush in accusing the most powerful known being of war crimes
8089325 alright then am i going to have to pass through here again when i go back
8089326 if if you go back and no probably not i think i shall cease to exist as soon as you leave here
8089327 so i am immortal and unnatural manufactured you shall not forget me so i shall be immortal and even after you face your own mortality the idea of me will still be out there for anyone else to manufacture but yes i will no longer be once you are gone
8089328 not imagined since we both are actually here but manufactured conjured pulled into being yes

8089402 on a worldwide basis the phenomenon of peak oil can be thought of as a crisis in resources needed to produce oil its the size of the tap not the size of the tank as we deplete the large easy to produce fields and move to ever more difficult fields it takes more and more oil rigs more petroleum engineers and more investment dollars eventually we reach a point where we are out of equipment out of trained personnel and the investment cost for expanding production becomes prohibitive when production begins to drop because of all of these pressures we reach peak oil

8089502 once a woman arrived she would have to mingle among the crowds of men who gather around the polls and to press her way through them to the ballot box assuming she reached the polling place she might get caught in a brawl and given womens natural fragility she would be the one to get hurt
8089503 there were times and periods in womens lives when the required rest not only for mind but for body and to drag them into the political arena under those conditions would be cruel indeed
8089504 because all government rests ultimately on force to which women owing to physical moral and social reasons are not capable of contributing
8089505 because past legislation in parliament shows that the interests of women are perfectly safe in the hands of men
8089506 but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your god and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear
8089507 i confessed and repented to my husband and daughter for the selfishness and singularity of my sin i embraced my role as wife and mother the best i could and slowly began to feel a joy and peace in my life that can only come from living for gods will and not my own i was not completely full because in this life we never are but i was walking with the lord i was headed in the right direction slowly and painfully i am coming to grips with the fact that i will never finish my masters degree by now my student loan payments have started to kick in a monthly reminder of that part of me i feel is so incomplete my graduate student standing has long since expired but i cant bear to take myself off the department mailing list i keep my textbooks tucked away in a dusty box just in case the lord changes his mind i still have that darker part of my soul that hangs on to the temptation for a life apart from god to pursue my own glory

8089511 all emerging movements in the church that do not have the voices of women as teachers and writers and speakers and theologians are false now i dont know if i meant to say that so strongly well yes yes i did mean to say that so strongly
8089512 when you realize that men have subjugated women for thousands of years you can only wonder how it took so long for the feminist movement to form it is unfortunately rare to find a marriage in which the husband recognizes that he bears the responsibility of headship and exercises it in humility and love rather than force and authoritarianism while i too am against so much of what the feminist movement advocates i understand why it has emerged i believe that if christian men had been the servant leaders in the home rather than conceited chauvinists the feminist movement would have died a quick and easy death if men had sought ways to see the gifts and talents of their wives developed and utilized rather than taking a beautiful person and making her into little more than a personal slave if men had not twisted this doctrine of headship we would not have the current problems between men and women in our society i am tired of hearing that feminists are responsible for the breakdown of the family we need to put the responsibility where it belongs on the heads of homes

8089520 what do you see as the greatest challenge for young christians in the next 10 years
8089521 there is a strong drift toward the hard theological left some emergent types want to recast jesus as a limp wrist hippie in a dress with a lot of product in his hair who drank decaf and made pithy zen statements about life while shopping for the perfect pair of shoes in revelation jesus is a pride fighter with a tattoo down his leg a sword in his hand and the commitment to make someone bleed that is a guy i can worship i cannot worship the hippie diaper halo christ because i cannot worship a guy i can beat up i fear some are becoming more cultural than christian and without a big jesus who has authority and hates sin as revealed in the bible we will have less and less christians and more and more confused spiritually self righteous blogger critics of christianity
8089522 jane i dont like cavillers or questioners until you can speak pleasantly remain silent
8089523 averse to personal publicity we veiled our own names under those of currer ellis and acton bell the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming christian names positively masculine while we did not like to declare ourselves women because without at that time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called feminine we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice we had noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality and for their reward a flattery which is not true praise
8089524 literature cannot be the business of a womans life and it ought not to be the more she is engaged in her proper duties the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation
8089525 conventionality is not morality self righteousness is not religion to attack the first is not to assail the last to pluck the mask from the face of the pharisee is not to lift an impious hand to the crown of thorns these things and deeds are diametrically opposed they are as distinct as is vice from virtue men too often confound them they should not be confounded appearance should not be mistaken for truth narrow human doctrines that only tend to elate and magnify a few should not be substituted for the world redeeming creed of christ

8089540 our goal in partnering with relayhealth is to create a flexible and readily accessible claims processing system that enables us to provide an optimal member experience
8089541 the propbm application suite supports this goal and integrates well with other regence systems it also institutes quality controls throughout the claims adjudication process
8089542 we are very pleased to have regence join the growing number of clients using relayhealths propbm system
8089543 the fact that the system was selected after a long and intensive review further validates propbm as the premier enterprise application for pharmacy benefit management organizations
8089544 in a fast paced clinical environment the ability to confidently make life saving decisions makes all the difference
8089545 information is what drives those decisions and automation across the continuum of care is essential to ensure that information is delivered consistently
8089546 secure electronic access to patient information saint vincent health center will deploy mckesson physician portal using the portal physicians can review patient test results orders and diagnostic results regardless of location
8089547 we look forward to being part of their journey as they work to improve their performance and the care they provide to the community
8089548 we are very pleased with the outcome of our stockholder meeting including our stockholders
8089549 both andy bryant and ed mueller bring extensive and complementary experience to our board and i look forward to their continued contributions
8089550 our commitment to quality has always been a key strategy for anmed health and we are very proud of our iso 9000 laboratory registration
8089551 our lab department needed a solution to electronically store requisitions for its outreach program
8089552 managing paper processes for day to day transactions for multiple acute care facilities and offices is complex when you are faced with pushing paper we knew there had to be a better way and mckesson is helping us get there
8089553 with horizon enterprise content manager we can dramatically streamline processes by putting all of that information online and giving authorized staff immediate and secure access to employee information
8089554 this is a tool that addresses the growing challenge organizations like anmed health face in centrally managing and creating immediate secure access to mission critical content
8089555 as a full enterprise solution its capabilities drive value in all departments in which high volumes of unstructured content are required by their business processes or systems
8089556 i m very pleased to have jim on board he has an exceptional background that combines management healthcare and government experience which will serve as an outstanding foundation to further build success for our care management services

8089558 over 4 000 healthcare stakeholders including government agencies health plans and hospitals use interqual criteria this vast market reach is due to the product
8089559 the real key to helping our clients maximize the value of interqual is ensuring that the users are fully trained to that end we are excited to be enhancing our service offering this year by providing certified instructor training to the qios
8089560 the rapid growth in onmarks contract portfolio over the past three and a half years reflects our commitment to providing industry leading value to more than 2 600 member clinics
8089561 we are passionate about delivering value to our members through our relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturers
8089562 through our focus on delivering innovative contracts practice management resources clinical tools and educational programs we enable physicians and their staff to run their practices more efficiently and provide the highest quality patient care possible
8089563 in 2005 the entire industry had to come to terms with a significant decrease in the reimbursement for drugs administered in oncology clinics
8089564 this change required oncologists to adjust the way they traditionally conducted business and re evaluate what financial success meant as our survey shows even three years later we are still seeing the effects these changes have had on the industry
8089565 simply stated the confluence of these factors has resulted in oncologists being required to do more with less
8089566 prior to medicares move to base reimbursement amounts on average sales price asp rather than average wholesale price awp many oncologists could shift dollars as necessary to pay for care and materials that were not otherwise covered with the new reimbursement structure physicians must pay more attention to their business seeking to streamline operations leverage the use of technology and improve efficiency all while ensuring quality patient care
8089567 there has been tremendous change in the healthcare environment over the past 10 years and the rate of change going forward continues to accelerate
8089568 this change has placed a great amount of stress on oncologists who often struggle to balance our patients needs against the needs of our practice benchmarking surveys such as onmarks are a meaningful way to compare our practices performance with the industry as a whole and thereby make continuous improvements to increase efficiencies lower operating costs and maintain a high level of clinical excellence
8089569 we understand the complex and changing landscape of the specialty care market and the resulting challenges facing our members
8089570 by providing an annual benchmarking survey we hope to help physicians identify potential staffing inefficiencies find opportunities to lower operating costs and develop solutions for process improvement
8089571 it s rewarding to see how our customers are harnessing the power of it and automation to enable clinicians to coordinate and track patient care while also improving the economics of care
8089572 the emergency department is the front door for more than 40 percent of clinical experiences in the hospital setting but it
8089573 for a department that operates with limited resources and razor thin margins en chart helps eds save both time and money combined with our industry leading ed information system or an organization
8089574 our comprehensive solution supports that goal while helping customers preserve and improve their financial health
8089575 capturing proper ed coding on the front end of care generates positive returns our solution serves a vital need for hospitals by improving documentation while simultaneously applying up to date coding guidelines and patient data analysis to create accurate and timely revenue cycles
8089576 reinventing processes to link revenue management with real time care delivery is critical

8089659 using this survey helps mckesson better measure the satisfaction with our disease management programs and ensures consistency across all clients
8089660 adoption of the dmaa participant satisfaction survey speaks not only to mckesson
8089661 we have participated in the 340b program since january 2004 but last year we actually became a lot better at tracking those eligible doses when we implemented mckesson
8089662 said tim smith director of pharmacy fort sanders regional medical center
8089663 this has allowed us to track all eligible doses and stay compliant with the rules and regulations from the office of pharmacy affairs and hrsa
8089664 without the 340b manager it would be impossible to completely know your in hospital opportunity for 340b savings
8089665 mckesson 340b manager has interfaced seamlessly with our other applications and has eliminated the majority of manual steps required to generate our 340b orders sent to mckesson
8089666 the federal 340b program can be an extremely beneficial program for health system pharmacies to deliver high quality patient care to low income patients within their communities
8089667 mckesson 340b manager helps hospital pharmacies overcome this challenge and identify more products eligible for replenishment positioning them to become a cost savings center within their health systems rather than a potential cost center
8089668 wow you can organize the dishes so neatly on the dish rack now

8089750 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
8089751 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
8089752 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
8089753 the message is for a kid from in marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
8089754 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
8089755 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
8089756 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
8089757 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
8089758 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
8089759 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
8089760 the most problematic hip hop gets 90 percent of the coverage in the non music press
8089761 hip hop is associated in so many peoples minds with crime drugs and misogyny so obamas faced with a constellation of problematic images the question is how do you send a message that doesnt wind up demonizing somebody
8089762 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
8089763 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
8089764 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big
8089765 during this election young people from all walks of life have responded to senator obamas message of hope and change for the future with great enthusiasm
8089766 and that includes those in the hip hop community individuals who are talented intelligent and entrepreneurial in spirit but who in the past have felt that government and politics dont really work for them
8089767 senator obama wants to engage the hip hop community more in the political process because issues including education jobs and health care are as important to this generation as any other we will be talking to the hip hop community more throughout this campaign and letting them know they have reason to put their trust in senator obama because he will work to fundamentally change their lives
8089768 the hip hop experience is for some the black experience and the campaign has been very inclusive and has been one that has welcomed voices from all over the country
8089769 with the hip hop community its been an interesting conversation because on the one hand we know the hip hop community has reflected a great deal of whats been happening in our inner cities for a long time and the systemic challenges that face that community senator obama has a plan as part of his overall call for change that will address those challenges the voice of the hip hop community will be reflected in this campaign with senator obamas plan for inner city communities
8089770 these situations are a case by case basis when and where and timing
8089771 the hip hop community has clearly embraced senator obama and they see him as someone who can effect change in a dramatic way the key with us as we go through the next few months is identifying opportunities where we can work together to communicate the senators message
8089772 i thought about hip hop associations harming obamas chances i really did
8089773 so in the concert i always say this is not sponsored by obama i make it very clear to say that cause i know obama associated with this guy from f in marcy projects i know thats coming any day i think about that often i mean what do you do what do i do i have to support the guy but i dont wanna hurt him i aint like the preachers and all those guys i dont wanna make the inappropriate statements and keep going im the guy that will fall back
8089774 you gotta speak what you feel you gotta be respectful though
8089775 like anything you do you cant come to anybodys show and be disrespectful if youre supporting them so you dont speak on nobody and act a fool
8089776 in some ways you have to assume most of the hip hop community will be behind him because they dont have a choice because their vote aint going to mccain
8089777 but if he uses this kind of secret code the dirt off the shoulder saying you and i both know it but i cant afford to say so it could work for him
8089778 rappers have to realize that supporting obama publicly is like a corporate meeting come support us but dress for the occasion
8089779 its hard you wanna see him be a part of it more but you know the powers that be are going to make it such a big deal theyll be like obama was with dude who was smoking weed i would love to see obama go on
8089780 if a king goes out and fights wars with his people his people will do anything for him
8089781 if youre just a king in your castle and you calling shots then the respect from the people will never be there we dont see our leaders with us in our situations on a heavy heavy level
8089782 a lot of people may not feel me on this but you gotta feel me if you real im not voting for obama
8089783 i dont like obama obama is a traitor he turned his back on everybody he turned his back on reverend jeremiah wright reverend wright has been with him since the beginning ludacris has done stuff in his support he speaks the truth but obama feels that a certain demographic may not vote for him because of it so he turns his back on luda bernie mac he invited bernie mac to come in and do his roast or whatever it was called bernie mac said some things that were offensive thats what bernie mac is known for what does he do turn his back on bernie mac whos he gonna denounce next im not even voting this year if i did vote it would be for mccain i like to know the enemy barack i dont know

8089794 all in all the whole concept of church sunday worship weekly activities and membership seems like one big womens society with in most cases a man at the helm with a message to get women to follow what he says
8089795 some christians will find it shocking a challenge to the uniqueness of their theology while others will be comforted by the idea of it being a traditional part of judaism
8089796 the problem lies in what we believe that a sign from god actually is
8089797 the description is far too lacking in detail but here are just a few problems with your test

8089800 is a relic of efforts to settle the west allows mining companies to claim federal lands for 5 an acre or less and then take gold silver lead or other hard rock minerals with no royalty payments to the public treasury thanks to the anachronistic 1872 mining act mining companies including foreign companies extract billions of dollars worth of minerals a year from federal lands royalty free change is regularly blocked by western lawmakers
8089801 obama said the legislation favored by environmentalists places a significant burden on the mining industry and could have a significant impact on jobs he also opposes the proposed fees
8089802 ok but we still have to figure out how we decide to align our grids if it is mere convention even if the resulting conclusions have significant then those conclusions are only relatively significant

8089806 old mines like the orphan were mined in the 1950s under no federal regulations whatsoever
8089807 most mines today are above the water table which makes chances of leakage practically nil what we have now is a well regulated industry
8089808 we already have the clean water act the national environmental policy act and others that require comprehensive analyses before any mining is done so there wont be impacts to the environment
8089809 at this time were still evaluating plans on an individual basis but a regional study is not something i can rule out
8089810 we hear from the industry and federal government that today we can do it safely
8089811 but thats not the way we do things today we understand and know a lot more about uranium radium and radon and the impacts of those so to say some things that happened in the 1950s and 1960s will happen again today is not a good comparison
8089812 when you take uranium and the other trace elements out of their resting places in nature and expose them to the environment
8089813 you expose them in higher concentrations to the environment and intensify their effects people dont appreciate the cumulative impact of mining in a consolidated area theres a very real threat
8089814 they would continue to be mobile through the aquifer and eventually discharge in springs impacting the human uses of water of these springs
8089815 statements that the historic operations at the orphan mine have been polluting horn creek are false

8089817 metal mining claims within 5 miles of cities and towns throughout the west jumped from 35 350 to more than 51 000 between 2003 and 2008 an increase of more than 46 percent
8089818 in 2006 hardrock metals mining was the number one source of toxic pollution in the united states generating 1 22 billion pounds of toxic chemical waste the majority of which was dumped into the environment near the mine mining has been the nations number one toxic polluter for nine straight years ever since reporting has been required

8089829 this book is pragmatical not philosophical a practical manual not a treatise upon theories it is intended for the men and women whose most pressing need is for money who wish to get rich first and philosophize afterward it is for those who have so far found neither the time the means nor the opportunity to go deeply into the study of metaphysics but who want results and who are willing to take the conclusions of science as a basis for action without going into all the processes by which those conclusions were reached
