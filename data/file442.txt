4420000 b side kitted out in the blue and gold colours of tipperary this was pretty much the
4420001 mighty one but just two months into it he is more than happy at the way things have gone and the rate of progress achieved
4420002 whatever else happens in my life i have truly enjoyed the past few months said fitzy
4420003 i came on board demanding honesty and commitment and i have got that in abundance from players whom i regard as first class people in every way
4420004 however my job has been made relatively easy by the approach and attitude of the players and everyone else involved he said
4420005 due credit that was especially true he said of the all ireland quarter final against wexford when the team had to pull out all to stops to retrieve what at one stage in the second half looked to be something of a lost cause
4420006 the players have worked really hard in training and that has been reflected in the last two games against offaly and wexford he said
4420007 without the level of passion and commitment shown by them on both those days we would not have survived them
4420008 more than happy at the response of the players when both these games were in the melting pot adding that every win helps to build team confidence
4420009 they tipp are a magnificent side probably the top team in the country right now along with kilkenny the banner man said
4420010 you cannot but admire all that they have done this year winning the waterford crystal tournament the national league the munster championship and going unbeaten through all of them
4420011 i know what the story in tipp is i have seen the passion of manager liam sheedy i have seen the passion of the players and i hope that on sunday next we will be able to match that passion all the way its one i really am looking forward to
4420012 they will be going into the game a very fresh team and knowing that they are just seventy minutes away from the final he said
4420013 we are glad too of the break we have had since beating wex ford but dont tell me that tipp are in any way disadvantaged by not having played since the munster final
4420014 not many people believed we would be after the first round defeat in munster he said
4420015 there are a lot of teams no longer in the title race who would dearly love to be where we will be next sunday
4420016 that has been made possible through the efforts i have got from every player it has been first class and having asked for honesty and commitment from day one they havent let me or themselves down in that regard
4420017 first hand with his own native county he doesnt need to be told what victory over tipperary would mean to everyone in waterford
4420018 after forty five years since the countys last appearance in the final it would be the realisation of a dream for so many people if we can pull it off he said
4420019 it will to some extent and trying to end such a lengthy hoodoo will inevitably put some pressure on us fitzy admits
4420020 i definitely am i suppose its easy to enjoy it when we are winning it would probably be different if and when we lose but at the moment its great to be involved its not easy to be on the sideline and not being able to do anything and the last two matches the wexford game in particular were nerve wrecking but its great all the same
4420021 having conceded three goals we were hanging by a thread and then when they got the penalty we were really on the brink thankfully damiens fitzhenry shot went narrowly over the bar but you cant help but think that if that penalty was three inches lower and went in the net that we could have been out of the championship and that it would be all over for another year but it didnt we won and you need those breaks and a little bit of luck to be successful and well take every one of them breaks that we get
4420022 it sounds obvious but there were things we were very pleased with in that game and there were things we were disappointed with but having looked back at the video a few times now i really think that you must give great credit to wexford for their performance on the day they marked us really tightly and really upped their performance from the leinster final defeat to kilkenny we must remember too that twelve months ago they came off the back of an even worse leinster final defeat and went out in the quarter finals and beat tipperary and we all know how good tipp are so ive no doubt that tipp would have gladly taken a one point win last year so thats why were delighted to take that win and move on to the next stage thats what its all about in knockout championship hurling it doesnt matter whether you win ugly or pretty once you win and thats very much they way we are looking at the wexford game
4420023 without doubt the performance of dan shanahan was a great boost to us
4420024 elsewhere our full forward line has been outstanding in the last three games but again they can only do the damage and play as well as that if they get the right kind of ball and they got great supply the last day and lets hope they get it again next sunday
4420025 without a doubt jamie really grew in confidence the last day and he has adapted really well and its hard to believe that that was only his second ever championship match at this level we always thought that he had all the attributes to do it at this level and though its early days he has done really well in his first two games
4420026 we had three weeks from the wexford game to the tipp game so we decided to split in two
4420027 not as good as wed like richie foley and gary hurney are both carrying niggley leg injuries and are struggling a bit and aidan kearney hasnt come right as wed hoped after his appendix operation he was actually better a week or two ago maybe he pushed it too hard were not sure but at this stage hes definitely a doubtful starter for sundays match on top of that he hasnt hurled since the clare game which was on the first day of june so it would be very hard to go into a game like this having been out for that long even if he were fully fit
4420028 well the fact that they are unbeaten so far in 2008 says all you need to know thats a great achievement when you consider that at this level you are playing top class opposition week in and week out so to be that consistent for that long is a very good sign of a team they also come across as a very united bunch very closely knit and thats shown by the fact that they have come through to win a lot of matches in the final quarter we know theyll be hard to breakdown but all well be hoping that well be there in the final ten minutes then it will be up to who wants it the most
4420029 they are very dangerous up front of course everyone will talk of kelly and corbett but the last day against clare their half forward line of kerwick callinan and obrien really came good as they scored 2 7 between them and thats great shooting but we know that and hopefully well be ready for them
4420030 theres no doubt that our lads have played there many more times than the tipp lads and that is a help but i remember when waterford beat tipp a few years ago in croke park there was a lot of talk about a jinx and all that and it didnt stop us from winning so at the end of the day its just another pitch and on top of that its one of the best pitches in the game so if you cant play there you wont play anywhere
4420031 our mindset is all about next sunday and the future and the fact that we are 70 minutes from an all ireland final and we are not thinking of the past at all
4420032 hurler of the year notwithstanding that all ireland semi final elimination browne believes that despite going into next sundays semi final against tipperary in the role of underdog the time is nigh for the ending of a famine that stretches back all of four and half decades since the decies last graced croke parks centre stage on all ireland final sunday
4420033 while some people may think that we are jinxed as far as semi finals are concerned or that some kind of hoodoo is hanging over us i dont believe for one moment that what has happened five times in a decade will have any bearing on sundays outcome says browne
4420034 those defeats are history as far as im concerned and im equally certain thats the way the rest of the lads view things as well in fact if anything those losses will motivate us even more on the day
4420035 we just keep on fighting despite all those setbacks and being the outsiders on sunday will suit us fine we never seem to carry the favourites tag well in any case
4420036 all systems go for him once the action gets under way on sunday
4420037 hugely impressed with all that they have achieved this year under their new manager liam sheedy
4420038 a team reborn and with an incredible unbeaten record behind them going into sundays game he knows full well just how difficult it will be to bring that run to an end
4420039 motoring superbly well and he and all of his colleagues know that they will have to produce a whole lot more than they have done to date this year if they are to set up that mouthwatering final meeting with the cats
4420040 thats the realty of the situation and theres nothing to be gained by us not facing up to it he said
4420041 huge impact the man from the banner has made in just two months at the helm
4420042 his enthusiasm is infectious an d it is rubbing off on all the lads in training he said
4420043 a distraction they could have done without the mount sion man is insistent that despite the turbulence it caused at he time the mood in the camp under fitzie is first class
4420044 he has thrown himself head long into the job and he has asked us for honesty and commitment said browne
4420045 i believe in fact i know that we have given him both and will continue to for as long as he remains our manager
4420046 we have no reason to fear tipp and our championship record against them in recent years speaks for itself
4420047 for every parent worried glitter will be wandering the streets let me reassure you that mans in for a hell of a tough time hell wish hed stayed in jail in vietnam when weve finished with him

4420086 it was so sociable everyone there was amazing and really fun it was somewhere you could sit back and meet people
4420087 we started going there because we made some friends who lived in camden every so often youd sit next to someone and get chatting and it would turn out that theyre a tv presenter

4420093 the customer subsequently received a letter from the christchurch family court apologising on behalf of the staff member for speaking to the customer in an unacceptable manner
4420094 the staff member confirms the conversation got out of control and he should not have spoken in the manner he did and he apologises
4420095 i had no idea being a librarian was so stressful until i carried out this research
4420096 i also studied train drivers teachers and the police and fire services as these are all occupations which have been in the media recently complaining about working conditions i was amazed to discover just how much more stressed librarians were than anyone else in a number of key areas they were definitely the most stressed overall

4420351 we have told the court we will announce within 45 days the new location of migron
4420352 the government caved in to settlers who threatened to use violence if they are evacuated while they illegally occupy private palestinian land
4420353 the thought of evacuating migron is against the torah and basic human morals
4420354 migron was erected in a fraudulent manner on private land taken from palestinians the same settlers who violated the law are now seeing their actions sanctioned by the law

4420367 it is wrong and weakens our military to have us troops tied down in iraq awaiting the iraqi politicians to settle their difference starting a war with iraq was a terrible decision
4420368 we cannot be a competitive or caring nation if all our citizens do not have healthcare
4420369 our dependence on foreign oil weakens the country and subjects the american people to gas prices determined by foreign dictators
4420370 your children deserve an education that allows them to compete in the world and they deserve well paying jobs when they graduate
4420371 we had a surplus when bush took over we now have the largest debt in world history that is not what we should be leaving to our children and grandchildren
4420372 our success as a nation has depended upon faith in our democratic processes and the application of the rule of law we need to restore faith in our democracy starting at the highest levels of government

4420379 we need to make sure that georgias transportation infrastructure is open is not restricted by russian ships in the black sea or russian armour in poti port or near gori
4420380 its just bizarre that naval forces are blockading a sovereign independent country
4420381 i cant imagine how anyone who is sane could think that could be acceptable or reasonable
4420382 i cant imagine how there could be any russian peacekeepers in the conflict zones
4420383 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations

4420392 thanks to the help of aid workers like these real progress has been made in improving the lives of the afghan people
4420393 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4420394 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4420395 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
4420396 many thousands of children are alive today thanks to aid work on improving health standards six million children are now in education two million of them girls compared to one million boys with girls banned from schools under the taliban
4420397 in contrast the insurgents have nothing to offer the afghan people other than more killings and intimidation
4420398 even in their absence the court believes it has authority to proceed with the case

4420433 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4420434 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4420435 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4420436 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4420437 i look forward to going to poland to sign that agreement soon
4420438 its important for the peace and security of the region its important for peace and security internationally
4420439 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4420440 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4420441 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4420442 ive said all along this has got to be resolved

4420463 its just going to take some time for me to get used to it and time to break them in so to speak but once i get past that stage i think that everything will be downhill from there both of my feet are hurting a little bit im going to have to get used to it and basically get my feet into shape so they can tolerate it if its too much then well probably do something else but well see how it goes
4420464 we had an extended amount of time here where we tried to improve his situation
4420465 it didnt seem like we were getting very far it was very unfortunate because we thought when we first brought shane in this would be something where both parties would benefit we had a veteran football player a guy who had gone through some things and was anxious to really start his career over we thought that this was the right situation we worked him out he was in outstanding shape and we didnt think there was going to be any down time whatsoever the unfortunate thing is that on his best practice day that very evening he couldnt come back out and practice we wished him well and hopefully he will get himself back to where he feels good about having an opportunity
4420466 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations

4420496 door verdere kostenbesparingen op de redactie van de krant af te wentelen loopt het vlaggenschip van dit concern zware averij op hiermee zou op termijn niet alleen de werkgelegenheid van de redactie van de telegraaf op het spel komen te staan maar dreigt ook het voortbestaan van tmg in gevaar te worden gebracht

4420501 in mijn ogen zijn obligaties tamelijk onschuldige beleggingsinstrumenten en heel iets anders dan aandelen welke macht heeft een obligatie belegger nou helemaal
4420502 maar de nederlandse bank en directielid red henk brouwer dachten daar anders over
4420503 die twee zaken resulteren in een materiele overtreding van de compliance regels

4420541 only 54 percent of eligible american voters cast their ballots half of them are only voting cause its cool to vote for so and so they arent even up to date on information
4420542 im personally not up to date on the facts so i dont wanna make a stupid choice for our country i want to vote but only when i know exactly whats going on more ppl should think like that paris hilton said yaaaay go vote cause its cool and hott she wasnt even registered
4420543 the haymarket location is both a vital artery to the city and a critical part of the edinburgh tram project

4420556 particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society
4420557 of course there are many courageous individuals in society but they have no determining influence on public life political and intellectual bureaucrats show depression passivity and perplexity in their actions and in their statements and even more so in theoretical reflections to explain how realistic reasonable as well as intellectually and even morally warranted it is to base state policies on weakness and cowardice
4420558 a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
4420559 a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either wherever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relations there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity paralyzing mans noblest impulses

4420580 seitdem die vp den innenminister stellt ist die kriminalit t in sterreich eklatant angestiegen und wie schon ihre vorg nger von der vp leugnet auch fekter dass diese entwicklung mit dem seit 2000 von der vp betriebenen personalabbau zusammenh ngt
4420581 anstatt sich den themen zu widmen die die menschen unmittelbar betreffen inszeniert fekter scheindebatten um vom versagen der vp in der sicherheitspolitik abzulenken
4420582 die jahrelangen besch nigungen und ausreden der vp ndern nichts daran dass das subjektive sicherheitsgef hl der sterreicherinnen und sterreicher stark gesunken ist daher m ssen endlich wieder mehr polizisten vor ort auf der stra e unterwegs sein das sind wir den menschen und der sicherheit in unserem land schuldig
4420583 packen wir s an und legen wir los personelles im hinblick auf die nationalratswahl 2008
4420584 wie die aktuelle einkommensstatistik des hauptverbandes der sterreichischen sozialversicherungstr ger beweist verdienen die frauen in wien am besten und hier ist auch die einkommensschere die kleinste in ganz sterreich somit ist wien ohne zweifel die stadt der frauen
4420585 im durchschnitt verdienen frauen um 33 prozent weniger als m nner jedoch haben die wienerinnen mit 1 900 euro sterreichweit das beste einkommen das ist das ergebnis einer verantwortungsvollen frauenpolitik

4420587 in wien wird alles daran gesetzt um frauen ein selbstbestimmtes und selbstst ndiges leben erm glichen zu k nnen umso mehr freut es mich dass die aktuelle einkommensstatistik unsere engagierte frauenpolitik f r wien einmal mehr unter beweis stellt
4420588 we have such great games with them and it does go either way
4420589 the tssa has been far more receptive and responsive than most to consumer advice and input
4420590 theres also this very profound kind of blurring of whos responsible when things go wrong and i think weve seen some of that in the last few days
4420591 i dont think these organizations would have been able to undertake the type of regulatory work they do without this type of model
4420592 im very disappointed for a professional organization like the tssa i would have expected they would have reliable and accurate information they could report to the public
4420593 we all have experiences in our lives that change us and we all learn from people like my dad but at the end of the day its only us too often in life something happens and we blame other people for us not being happy or satisfied or fulfilled

4420660 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4420661 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4420662 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4420663 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

4420681 whole foods is promoting local goods at many of its regional stores
4420682 that is something that both whole foods and wild oats used to do but had moved away from when they couldnt maintain local suppliers but increasingly reliable suppliers and rising transport costs mean that we are going to see more and more focus on local products

4420702 its a huge challenge for archivists to deal with digital information
4420703 one of the most interesting problems for digital preservation is interactivity and how difficult that is to preserve
4420704 video games offer all of the same problems as digital art
4420705 they are interactive very complex and a lot of people get involved in making them happen
4420706 you cannot just throw everything into a box and put it in the attic so in 50 years your kids can look at it
4420707 when you are trying to preserve anything you are trying to preserve the most important things about that artefact
4420708 with video games we do not yet know what is important
4420709 we want to raise the consciousness in the industry about how important these records are
4420710 i do not think they save anything or its saved in such a way that they would not be able to recognise the significance of what they are holding
4420711 a lot of people have mentioned that to me as a pivotal moment in their lives
4420712 i would like to talk to people who experienced that saw it happen or where they were when they heard about it
4420713 maybe we can talk to the people who did it and whether they knew lord british was richard garriott
4420714 you cannot just throw everything into a box and put it in the attic so in 50 years your kids can look at it
4420715 thats not going to happen because digital media degrades so fast
4420716 the raw formats that cameras capture images in are proprietary in nature so this raises issues around accessibility if the information about that raw format is lost
4420717 those are two areas that we need to address to do our jobs successfully not just for today but for the next generation
4420718 as more and more information is published in e only formats the legislation must keep pace so that we as digital librarians can keep this information safe without the threat of legal issues hanging over us

4420729 following national ballots we have been notified of one day of strike action on wednesday 20th august by the unison t amp g and gmb unions over the national 2 5 cost of living pay increase offer
4420730 our priority on the day of the strike will of course be to ensure that essential council services continue to be delivered
4420731 to that end the council is currently in talks with the unions and we are hoping to secure exemptions from the strike action for members of staff working in crucial service areas including residential homes for children and the elderly social works homelessness teams critical home care burials emergency health and safety and emergency roads teams unison branch secretary in the borders karen horsley is expecting thousands of workers to strike and picket various council offices throughout the borders she believes councils can find the extra money for staff and highlighted how her members had helped to deliver millions of pounds in efficiency savings over the last year she said
4420732 the ballot results reveal that local government employees are not prepared to accept an offer which would result in an ongoing effective deterioration of earnings for the next three years
4420733 the unions representing local government have now demonstrated to the employers and to the scottish government that the existing offer falls far short of what could be considered reasonable in the current climate of rising costs
4420734 the stuc calls on the local government employers to return to the negotiating table with an improved offer which addresses the increases in living costs of those workers who provide the essential services to the most vulnerable in scotland
4420735 only 29 of council staff are part of the union which works out at around 1500 people the vast majority of staff like myself will not be striking and services will not grind to a halt
4420736 i have some sympathy with the unions regarding the increased pay offer but local government only has so much funds the offer on the table is reasonable and it will be difficult to resolve this issue
4420737 the price of eggs had to go up because of the fact that the cost of feeding the chickens above all else has nearly doubled in a year
4420738 and of course the cost of electrcicity fuel and all the other things have risen dramatically too
4420739 the supermarkets have been very fair with us and eggs are still very good value for money
4420740 i wish to stress that this will be a stand alone application and that there will be no housing applications alongside it
4420741 the combination of hotel leisure conference and business facilities provides the right business model for this location with no requirement for housing to enable the development
4420742 through this development we will offer varied opportunities to the local workforce and the development of the scottish borders there will also be major opportunities for local sub contractors to work alongside our main contractor
4420743 we are really enthusiastic about acquiring a site in the south east of scotland to compliment what weve already delivered in the west of scotland through cameron house at loch lomond
4420744 this is a very exciting announcement and shows that the scottish borders is an excellent venue for such world class developments
4420745 it shows that the developers have a lot of faith in this area
4420746 it came as a complete shock to be awarded the baton out of the eighteen in my class i thought i might be in the top four so it really shocked me when my name was read out it was fantastic in front of my family
4420747 im so proud of her because she has worked so hard for this it was a nice shock to get and im so glad for her
4420748 hes over the moon and im absolutely delighted for him on the way down he told me that hed had a dream that he was going to win a gold his team from birminghams childrens hospital also won best childrens liver transplant team and jointly won best childrens team
4420749 it was an early birthday present because he will be celebrating his 12th birthday this saturday and will sign up to be a donor himself as in scotland the legal age of consent is 12 yrs old
4420750 we always have a supply of information and organ donor cards if anyone would like some and can be contacted via tel 723887 or info transplantkids co uk
4420751 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4420752 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4420753 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4420754 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4420755 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4420756 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4420757 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4420758 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4420759 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4420760 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4420761 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4420762 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4420763 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4420764 we are not just what you call underdogs but massive underdogs everything is there for a surprise
4420765 piaf was 47 when she died but she looked like an 80 year old woman
4420766 i can connect with that simplicity i love the idea of just performing in a black dress i dont use make up at all i just put mascara on my face
4420767 the morphine was because after her first car crash they took her to a very rural hospital and the doctor made a mistake he gave her morphine to stop the pain and then she couldnt give it up
4420768 i think piaf was quite modern for her time she was free about sexuality she was a good person she helped a lot of people during the war she gave people money and didnt keep enough for herself
4420769 when i watched footage i recognised i have some of the same gestures
4420770 in argentina we have a lot of europeans so our gestures are a little bit of everything
4420771 sometimes i think small people maybe have more strength than tall people because they have to go hey im here
4420772 im fine i really need to be alone because i think im building something i have no time for a boyfriend
4420773 you just have to go on with the show never mind how you feel during the day
4420774 some bits of piafs life were so terrible the day the love of her life the boxer marcel cerdan died in a plane crash she performed at night for him thats incredible you have to be very strong for that
4420775 we are a little bit dramatic we like that whole thing of singing a song thinking about our last love you almost enjoy it im very sad today im going to cry and then after that crying im going to be better
4420776 at the beginning i didnt socialise a lot because my english wasnt so good its not great now but i can talk
4420777 and i was very tired evita was very tough i had this new life with my partner in london i brought some of my family over for a holiday all that was quite stressful i was quite withdrawn now im more open ive met more people but im quite a house girl i dont like to go out a lot after a performance
4420778 i just go home have a nice meal take it easy and sleep
4420779 i try to keep my body toned and with strength
4420780 and my mum is taking care of him he cant speak although he can make sounds it was the left hemisphere of the brain that was damaged the right part is still there but we can understand him hes like an actor now its like a pantomime
4420781 it was good to do comedy after all that evita drama it was also my first proper straight play no singing at all
4420782 i am so grateful to michael who has given me such opportunities i feel that he likes me and thats very nice last year i went to the donmar a lot to see different productions i really love the space i think its magical so i was really happy with his decision to give me the opportunity to be piaf in this theatre
4420783 it was a terrible time because a lot of people disappeared many more than in the per n epoch
4420784 how lovely it is to be a performer but also sometimes how lonely you feel
4420785 im not famous i dont think i am beautiful i think that i am a happy person i want to live and i love life and then i think you can get everything you want if you really want it
4420786 sharp residential solar systems give families the ability to generate their own electricity from the inexhaustible energy of the sun with no harmful emissions theyre cost effective quiet attractive safe and reliable with only minimal maintenance required over their long operational life theyre the right choice for your home and the right choice for the environment its no wonder why so many homeowners are making the move to sharp solar
4420787 another beautiful day at downtown disneyland for indie fest usa events the short blocks overall were very impressive with a wide variety of styles and stories a few films that stand out were jonty reasons film daddy left me alone with god and an interesting film titled el taxista brock johnsens feature film about wwii was very very stylish
4420788 i work on the principle that its not possible to take anyones views on music seriously if they dont like the beatles everything else is a question of personal taste and therefore debatable but if you dont recognise the beatles as the twentieth centurys most inventive most influential and most talented composers youre pretty much admitting that youve rather missed the point of the last hundred years of musical endeavour should you fall into that category i do not condemn neither do i mock i merely despair and having despaired i move on

4420806 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4420807 my belief is that the president does not intend to leave the country there is no question of him leaving pakistan

4420816 only properties which are in the public interest may be expropriated for public purpose when the bill becomes law not all properties will be expropriated
4420817 it appears as if the unconstitutionality and the draconian nature of the proposed expropriation bill have dawned upon the policy makers and responsible members of the governing party in parliament
4420818 rather than adopting this ill conceived and unnecessary bill the government should instead enter into serious negotiations with organised agriculture and other affected interests to reach agreement on a land reform process that will be just and equitable non divisive effective economically acceptable expeditious and agriculturally sustainable
4420819 they are trying to come to a settlement before the southern african development community sadc meeting tomorrow
4420820 they are already in south africa at the moment and they are discussing they are actually negotiating
4420821 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4420822 we are travelling to south africa with president robert mugabe today friday as the negotiations continue
4420823 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later
4420824 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4420825 our regional college information program has earned an excellent reputation among high school students as the place to go to get college information when they need it
4420826 could have a substantial impact in industries such as the electronics and computer industries where the largest companies with hundreds if not thousands of patents regularly cross license each others portfolios to avoid internecine patent litigation
4420827 patent owners will have to find ways to minimize its impact
4420828 in particular the decision does not prevent the use of contractual clauses or remedies to preserve or to replicate a patent owners options
4420829 we have built a strong foundation for a venture capital firm at ifdc and the addition of mr williams is the cornerstone

4420831 having recently received our mill permit it is exciting to see mill construction underway in addition now we have mill equipment at or being transported to our marshalling yard in laredo texas in anticipation of ultimately clearing customs on their way to the aguila mill site we are optimistic the next federal permit for the mill tailings facility will be granted shortly so construction of the tailings facility can begin permits dictate our production time frame and though we do not see any issues that would preclude the granting of the remaining permits it is apparent that our production time frame will now push into the first quarter of 2009
4420832 gold resource corporation has come a long way in less than two years as a public company and we fully expect to continue our aggressive pace as we establish gold production at our flagship el aguila project
4420833 1 000 people came to russerts memorial service because essentially he was a shill for the government
4420834 the on air persona of an attentive and accommodating headwaiter
4420835 as a public official it was really first of all a treat to get on the show
4420836 he never treated politicians with the cynicism that attends some of these interviews so they had a place to be loved
4420837 he russert understood as well as anyone maybe better than almost anyone that the reason political reporters are there is not to speak truth to power but to make those who say we have the truth politicians explain it

4420872 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4420873 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4420874 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4420875 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4420876 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4420877 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4420878 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
4420879 olbermanns success like oreillys is evidence of viewer cocooning the inclination to seek out programming that reinforces ones own firmly held political views
4420880 we know any points we get this season will have come from hard work

4420885 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4420886 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4420887 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4420888 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the
4420889 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4420890 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4420891 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4420892 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4420893 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4420894 i have no indication that russias invasion of georgia at all influenced the negotiations but who knows you can draw your own conclusions
4420895 however the european missile defense is not aimed at countering russias missile arsenal but rather at emerging threats such as iran
4420896 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4420897 one of the best people i have ever worked with
4420898 i wouldnt do what the other show does and pre record it i dont like producing something as live it is either live or not with this there is no question of a doubt the result would leak and it would feel a little bit like it wasnt real
4420899 i dont ever get excited about the auditions but i watch the show back and that is when i know we have done something good or not
4420900 does the show look good has it moved on is the talent good are the ratings good that is when i get excited but actually filming the auditions is like going to the dentist without anesthetic

4420902 china is the worlds biggest growth engine and beijing is at the heart of this
4420903 owning our own property in china puts us in a unique position in this market unlike other international brands we are firmly planting our feet in china and we are here to stay
4420904 our business development team is signing up more properties so that we may have up to 20 properties under the frasers brand before the close of 2010
4420905 demand for our unique bled of hospitality comfort luxury and full service has been growing worldwide particularly in a newly developing economy like china which is so open to foreign business
4420906 s lo puede lamentarse de que en estos momentos tan dif ciles el lado estadounidense est agravando las relaciones con rusia
4420907 el hecho de que esto haya sido firmado en un per odo de una crisis muy dif cil en las relaciones entre rusia y ee uu sobre la situaci n en georgia muestra que por supuesto el sistema de defensa antimisiles ser desarrollado no contra ir n sino contra el potencial estrat gico de rusia
4420908 adecco believes that there is scope for a combination with michael page which is to the benefit of both companies and their respective shareholders
4420909 the board unanimously concluded that this revised proposal also materially undervalued the company and its prospects and that the proposed transaction structure was unattractive for shareholders
4420910 adecco places considerable value on the management and strong culture of michael page it is therefore important to adecco that it is able to retain the senior management of michael page in the event that an offer is completed
4420911 i was skeptical from the beginning on this transaction adecco will have to raise the bid significantly to perhaps at least 500 pence per michael page share to make the situation friendly
4420912 it is likely the approach will remain hostile as the gap between what adecco is willing or can pay with regard to their discipline on the balance sheet and the price at which michael page will be willing to talk is too large
4420913 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4420914 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4420915 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4420916 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4420917 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4420918 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4420919 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4420920 our mission at criterion is to provide the most entertaining gaming service possible in order to do that its key that we have the ability to deliver content to players in ways that work for them through quick and easy download or via traditional bricks and mortar

4420922 pulmonary physicians are looking desperately for anything to improve the clinical course of patients with copd
4420923 the main finding is that all three arms of pharmacotherapy and this included inhaled corticosteroids a long acting beta agonist called salmeterol and a combination of both were effective in altering the rate of decline
4420924 so the decline was not as quick and as steep as those patients who were receiving placebo
4420925 this study is a much larger study and it does have some of the same flaws as the other studies mainly that some patients are not contributing any data on lung function in fact a large number
4420926 and because of that you cant really know thats why my editorial says theres some hopeful signs here but we cant really be conclusive
4420927 well why should we want to use all of these medications and especially the combination one
4420928 if the three drug therapies are giving exactly the same slope of decline the same improvement in slope of decline which one of the three should we choose
4420929 they should choose the safest one and thats the salmeterol by itself
4420930 it will alter my practice probably as of this afternoon when i go for a clinic to see a new copd patient
4420931 there is a slightly higher chance of pneumonia of getting an infection of the lung when you use the combination at least when you use either the inhaled corticosteroids or inhaled corticosteroids with the salmeterol
4420932 so yes there is a slight risk but it is relatively small and it does not affect mortality
4420933 the main finding is that for the first time its been shown that administering pharmacotherapy to patients with copd can change and modify the clinical course of their disease

4421014 a lot of companies were really reluctant to embrace technology
4421015 at sid lee it was important that everyone everyone embrace technology really early
4421016 most agencies ended up dealing with digital by creating departments
4421017 the newspapers were saying we dont need that any more the consumers are not there yet
4421018 the capital was no longer there but consumers were so we decided to hold on
4421019 instead of bothering all consumers with what we want to introduce to them we should be focusing on those who have an interest and go deeper farther with those consumers
4421020 this is richer than plastering cities with mgm posters that can only carry a three second message the advertising industry has been built on the notion that you have to have frequency and multiply it by reach we believe its frequency multiplied by reach but now theres a new variable intensity
4421021 a lot of agencies will say theyre not traditional advertisers
4421022 but then they will still present you with a 60 second spot as the heart of everything thats absolutely not the way sid lee works they are consumer focused and come up with the best solution of how we are going to engage that consumer from start to finish at all of the consumer touch points
4421023 we would really like to move into the 18 to 22 sweet spot
4421024 in the u s we might do a lot more online in asia we might do a lot more with mobile thats why an idea that comes from an agency like sid lee that can work across every platform is so key

4421231 all food had to be in the pass in 30 seconds or 60 seconds or 3 minutes and guys on the stations would have timers to keep track

4421235 hey it must be okay since the bishop said so and no ones complaining
4421236 oh well we think its okay and dont tell anyone
4421237 a very typical pale hue with a glint of green it has an attractive and expressive minerality steely yet with a presence of ripe white fruits wrapped around this harder core with a leafy nettly outer wrapping fine structure ripe fruits nicely rounded out but with a little backbone of grip and very decent acidity a little lacking in substance and character perhaps especially through the midpalate and the 2005 was undeniably superior but good and a worthy buy nevertheless
4421238 crisp clean and refreshing with lively and tangy flavors leaving you with a juicy mouthful of peaches and pears

4421241 young man heres the fire you and your frying can hop right into it
4421242 an amazing experience working at emerils you learned every day in the kitchen
4421243 the competition in the kitchen was genuine and the friendships were genuine
4421244 because it allows for more finesse and a la minute cooking and more opportunity to work with pan sauces
4421245 a lot about the temperature of the pans control of the heat what kind of oil theyre using and things like how hot you can heat extra virgin olive oil
4421246 we know that mushrooms and celery go together and that scallops and mushrooms and celery go together we know that if we add veal stock to the scallops mushrooms and celery then all of that will go well together you can finish that up with a little butter to tone down the veal stock and if you add a little truffle oil you bridge the gap between the sauce and the mushrooms
4421247 or you can tell me your least favorite chef that might well make for an even more interesting story
4421248 i knew where he came from and how hard he worked i learned a good bit from him and his knowledge was very good and he treated people with respect he had a special way hed lead the whole team into the fire and youd follow him its a gift hes a phenomenal gentleman and i have a very high respect for him
4421249 he taught me how to cook down the when i worked in his kitchen and i told him i was going to steal the recipe

4421279 de juana chaos es una escoria social que produce repu
4421280 my soul proclaims the greatness of the lord my spirit rejoices in god my saviour for he has looked with favour on his lowly servant from this day all generations will call me blessed the almighty has done great things for me and holy is his name he has mercy on those who fear him in every generation he has shown the strength of his arm and has scattered the proud in their conceit casting down the mighty from their thrones and lifting up the lowly he has filled the hungry with good thing and sent the rich away empty he has come to the aid of his servant israel to remember his promise of mercy the promise made to our ancestors to abraham and his children for ever
4421281 the historical mary experienced poverty oppression violence and execution of her son her faith is deeply rooted in that context before the omnipotent god she recognizes her own lowly estate she is not among the worlds powerful she is simply gods maidservant but she believes that nothing is impossible for god in the magnificat she sings confidently that god rescues life from death joy from sorrow light from darkness
4421282 the song of mary is the oldest advent hymn it is at once the most passionate the wildest one might even say the most revolutionary advent hymn ever sung this is not the gentle tender dreamy mary whom we sometimes see in paintings this is the passionate surrendered proud enthusiastic mary who speaks out here this song has none of the sweet nostalgic or even playful tones of some of our christmas carols it is instead a hard strong inexorable song about collapsing thrones and humbled lords of this world about the power of god and the powerlessness of humankind
4421283 i think he gets 6 feet 5 inch tall stride points we took 45 46 steps i think last time i checked he is taking 41 42
4421284 behold yhwh our god has shown us his glory and his greatness and his voice that we heard out of the midst of the fire
4421285 face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire
4421286 yhwh himself was in some sense localized within the fire
4421287 on the day you stood before the lord your god
4421288 first four words of each half of the verse are meant to be parallel
4421289 indicate that it was the initial giving of the law which occurred out of the midst of the fire
4421290 has shown us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice
4421291 he added no more but wrote them on two tablets of stone
4421292 commandments were such a complete summary of the fundamental requirements of the covenant that no other law needed to be added
4421293 the fixed basis indelibly recorded in stone years earlier the rest of the law is more contingent for it relates specially to life in palestine
4421294 the separation between the decalogue and other laws therefore is part of the same picture as the insistence that the people saw no form but heard only a voice namely an insistence on the primacy of the word in israels relationship with yahweh
4421295 becomes a model for all time of israels position before god at the place of decision this paradigm encounter affirms that israel did once meet yahweh in a way that was decisive for its life and therefore that it can and must go on doing so
4421296 when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking the people were afraid and trembled and they stood far off
4421297 do not fear for god has come to test you that the fear of him may be before you that you may not sin
4421298 the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of fire
4421299 all the days that they live on the earth and that they may teach their children so
4421300 i am coming to you in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with you and may also believe you forever
4421301 let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god or see this great fire any more lest i die
4421302 for you have not come to something that can be touched to a burning fire and darkness and gloom and a whirlwind and the blast of a trumpet and a voice uttering words such that those who heard begged to hear no more
4421303 for they could not bear what was commanded if even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned
4421304 deut likes to use the word q h l to signify the wholeness and unity of the people of israel just as it frequently uses all israel it uses it most frequently to refer to the day of the great original assembly at horeb sinai 4 10 9 10 10 4 18 16 and 33 4
4421305 an intensive plural that underscores the truth conveyed by the adjective
4421306 and he declared to you his covenant which he commanded you to perform that is the ten commandments and he wrote them on two tablets of stone
4421307 the term is also found outside the old testament used in treaties for the treaty stipulations
4421308 and he declared to you his covenant which he commanded you to perform that is the ten commandments and he wrote them on two tablets of stone
4421309 we have set up scores of watch towers and have cameras placed in open areas crossroads and major entrances
4421310 in 18 years of taking part in debates i have never seen an incident like this one
4421311 we are waiting for an order to follow but both sides must act together
4421312 if thai troops begin pulling back we will also begin pulling back
4421313 the best blogs have a tinge of obsession about them
4421314 a big hit on the web one of londons obsessives
4421315 if the association between leadership and health and well being described in this review represents a true relationship it would be extremely important that leadership function was considered measured and evaluated and good leadership practices were promoted in all work environments
4421316 because all the sudden it turns into an inspection if they see something they dont like
4421317 he buys into it and the employees buy into it although in the construction industry there are still some workers who want to do things the way theyve always done things
4421318 what do you consider the most important achievement of osha during the bush administration
4421319 a steady move toward a more helpful attitude from compliance officers and the inclusion of the training officers
4421320 a true switch to being a resource and help rather than a bad cop
4421321 emphasis on partnerships with business rather than heavy handed compliance
4421322 has there been an actual osha during this administration could have fooled me
4421323 the revocation of the ergonomics standard it immediately set the tone of his administration and provided a glimpse into his view of the importance of worker safety
4421324 what is the most important thing you do to improve safety and health in your organization
4421325 assist in developing a safety culture believed in by all constantly strive for zero accidents having all employees live with the goal of everyone being a safety manager
4421326 tries to put the dollar amount of an osha fine
4421327 this shows management what we would face if it was an osha inspection
4421328 translate corporate policy into a personal value for each covered employee remind each employee to reflect on what returning home safely at the end of the day means to them their families and friends
4421329 when youre in the middle of wyoming they dont let you leave much because theyre afraid you wont come back
4421330 wyoming is one of the economic bright spots in the country
4421331 the upside is there is a high demand for workers and the downside is a shortage of skilled workers we have one contractor who has a 30 percent turnover on a monthly basis
4421332 they realize that maintaining adequate safety staffing is efficient and a good way to operate
4421333 workers were taking risks reaching into equipment to clear jams because it took less time and there was attitude because i was a woman coming into a mans environment and telling them what to do
4421334 we have rules and if they jeopardize their safety with drugs or alcohol they know well send them home for 30 days without pay
4421335 trying to comply would put us out of business were a small mill with limited resources
4421336 where is the most room for improvement in your organization facilitys safety and health program
4421337 what if any impact do you think the outcome of the 2008 presidential election will have on occupational safety and health
4421338 a liberal administration will try to impose more penalties on business and be more employee friendly a conservative administration will be more reasonable and more supportive of business
4421339 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4421340 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4421341 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4421342 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4421343 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4421344 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4421345 the driver for it no pun intended was really an environmental one
4421346 i did not find i needed a car last year
4421347 we did make immediate assessments and also recommendations in ways to comply with the requirements of our regulatory agencies
4421348 obviously the american mer rovers spirit and opportunity that were put up by nasa enjoyed an extreme amount of success they were able to travel large distances well beyond their planned lifetimes but were hoping that with our baby well be able to go places that are actually much further
4421349 its quite a tense period for us in astrium and for the other companies involved in building exomars and for all the many many scientists who will depend on this mission
4421350 on the one hand we are moving ahead with a great momentum as youve seen this is not a paper project there is real engineering going on and we are on the verge of building the real hardware that will go on to the planet mars
4421351 but on the other hand we do have a real problem in order to complete the project further funding needs to be made available and it wont be until november that we are sure that that is in place
4421352 the uk will be working with its international partners to try to bring about a mission that has high impact and is affordable in a process of negotiation that will culminate in decisions at the ministerial in november 2008
4421353 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4421354 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4421355 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4421356 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4421357 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4421358 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4421359 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4421360 our towns and cities should be shaped as far as possible according to residents wishes not by the presence of unwanted lap dancing clubs in the heart of them
4421361 you are a holy nation unto g d g d has chosen you to be his treasured nation more than all the nations on the face of the earth
4421362 we dont have enough home grown outrages why get involved with chinese battles
4421363 i am g d your g d who has take you out of egypt from the house of bondage
4421364 if the bia helps those real estate developers take our land
4421365 that will be theft but if we keep the land that is certainly not theft
4421366 i am quoting the same man who said property is theft he also said property is impossible i speak from the heart i wish you to understand why i take this case i wish you to understand in fullness
4421367 you mean that justice is not known like a dog who barks in the night that it is more like the unexpected sound in the woods that must be identified cautiously after hard thinking
4421368 no man can hold them long i have spent many years in courtrooms and i have seen property and justice change when a man speaks change as the caterpillar changes to the butterfly do you understand me i thought i had victory in my hands and then the judge spoke and it went away like water running through the fingers
4421369 i understand you mean we will lose again we are accustomed to losing since george washington promised us these lands as long as the mountain stands and the grass is green and then broke his promise and stole part of them back in ten years in ten years my friend we have lost always lost we have one acre left of each hundred promised to us then
4421370 i promise you the bia will at least know they have been in a fight this time i learn more tricks and get nastier each time i go into a courtroom i am very tricky and very nasty by now but i am less sure of myself than i was when i took my first case i no longer understand what i am fighting i have a word for it the snafu principle i call it but i do not understand what it is
4421371 i worked long ago in new york city in construction like many young men of the mohawk nation i found that whites were often like us and i could not hate them one at a time but they do not know the earth or love it they do not speak from the heart usually they do not act from the heart they are more like the actors on the movie screen they play roles and their leaders are not like our leaders they are not chosen for virtue but for their skill at playing roles whites have told me this in plain words they do not trust their leaders and yet they follow them when we do not trust a leader he is finished then also the leaders of the whites have too much power it is bad for a man to be obeyed too often but the worst thing is what i have said about the heart their leaders have lost it and they have lost mercy they speak from somewhere else they act from somewhere else but from where like you i do not know it is i think a kind of insanity
4421372 we went to fight a bad white man or so the whites told us we had meetings that were called orientation and education there were films it was to show us how this bad white man was doing terrible things in his country everybody was angry after the films and eager to fight except me i was only there because the army paid more than an indian can earn anywhere else so i was not angry but puzzled there was nothing that this white leader did that the white leaders in this country do not also do they told us about a place named lidice it was much like wounded knee they told us of families moved thousands of miles to be destroyed it was much like the trail of tears they told us of how this man ruled his nation so that none dared disobey him it was much like the way white men work in corporations in new york city as sam has described it to me i asked another soldier about this a black white man he was easier to talk to than the regular white man i asked him what he thought of the orientation and education he said it was shit and he spoke from the heart i thought about it a long time and i knew he was right the orientation and education was shit when the men from the bia come here to talk it is the same shit but let me tell you this the mohawk nation is losing its soul soul is not like breath or blood or bone and it can be taken in ways no man understands my grandfather had more soul than i have and the young men have less than me but i have enough soul to talk to old grandfather who is a raccoon now he thinks as a raccoon and he is worried about the raccoon nation more than i am worried about the mohawk nation he thinks the raccoon nation will die soon and all the nations of the free and wild animals that is a terrible thing and it frightens me when the nations of the animals die the earth will also die that is an old teaching and i cannot doubt it i see it happening already if they steal more of our land to build that dam more of our soul will die and more of the souls of the animals will die the earth will die and the stars will no longer shine the great mother herself may die
4421373 and it will be because men do not speak words but speak shit
4421374 and youre going to tell the judge that in exactly those words
4421375 as long as the mountain stands and the grass is green
4421376 these young blondes can be mighty flighty but i will try my best to handle rielle if i get the gig
4421377 shut up you old fool the only thing youll be handling is dirty diapers rielle and i are going to be busy shopping and going to new age soirees in the bmw youre taking care of the baby
4421378 at the last minute weve been unable to reach mutually agreeable terms with valve on bcr so they wont be carrying it

4421481 behind nations there are classes adrift in a great terror showing the trapdoor where i just wanted to demonstrate some part i claimed to know

4421485 whoever practices this disrespects himself and when he does this he weakens his own ethics and by disseminating it that of other citizens
4421486 they cling to the same sophism i added by which facing the threats of the yankee empire against the soviet empire we once put up with the stalinist horrors you wont sever my free thought again with that cardboard cup whoever believes in democracy and freedom should stand up against the bush empire against the chavista one and against all fundamentalisms

4421489 poetry is the last religion we have left if theres a final judgment it will take place in front of her brodsky says that if poetry is seen as the supreme form of eloquence it ceases to be an art and becomes our anthropological genetic end our entire wager takes place under poetry and thats not just an aesthetic its an ethics

4421494 theres an extremely serious situation because this president is a threat he has created a parallel army and is ultimately preparing a war no one knows exactly against whom
4421495 more concerned with the cult of his personality fed by shameful adulations and that like many other leaders he considers himself to be supported by what they call god whom they turn into their own lackey putting him at their own service and speaking in his name but in the end they turn him into a criminal
4421496 venezuela is a divided country and you cant go on in that fashion among intellectuals there is a sector that supports the government and another that rejects it
4421497 one can express oneself and i ask myself why very simple because the government knows the masses dont read articles and interviews but they do watch television and listen to the radio which is where he puts pressure and vigilance
4421498 tv stations and networks of local radio stations perfect for dominating
4421499 but not only because of his poetry but rather for his thought that of a radical mystic closer to the asian current that interests me so much

4421553 eas people showed a big interest to my ideas and they understood what i really wanted to do and thats how it happened to come to ea
4421554 of course i had a chance to present it to different publishers but ea was the company that understood the game and understood my approach to it thats why i took the chance to work with ea also ea produced rock band so they understand the soul of rock
4421555 i actually presented two ideas at the same time and ea really liked one idea
4421556 there was a problem with customer cheques but thats been sorted now
4421557 weve reimbursed everyone affected and well be sending them an extra voucher as an apology for the inconvenience
4421558 as for the insolvency rumours theyre not true at all weve just opened multiple new stores and had our annual party which isnt the type of thing an insolvent company would do
4421559 weve treated them as the biggest for a fair while now once euk lost the tesco account to handleman in 2007 they went cap in hand to other supermarkets for their business it came at a cost for publishers because asda turned up the heat on price its caused a fair amount of tension
4421560 theyre massive you worry about querying stock movement or other problems too much because if you lose your relationship you lose access to over 25 per cent of the market
4421561 and of course you cant just sell your family game into asda which made complete sense with former asda partner igloo back in the day youve got to sell it into all of their partners as well
4421562 god knows what that could reach if euk keeps on getting more powerful its actually a bit scary
4421563 as far as overall value market share is concerned the only publicly quoted data available is via tns whilst this varies by format and time of the year the latest data for console software would suggest that a combination of game and gamestation continue to lead the market

4421566 he played admirably through three and a half quarters most of the time it was just one thing here or there during inopportune times wed turn the football over some of it was his responsibility and some of it wasnt but hes the one who shouldered the blame for the whole deal
4421567 he didnt play perfectly it wasnt carelessness it was out of eagerness to be successful and trying to do his part but there are a lot of reasons for interceptions sometimes they definitely fall on the quarterback but its a team sport it could be a wrong route a tipped ball or a broken protection we learned last year that everybody is accountable for our lack of success
4421568 i was worried after graduating from high school because i had no relations in phnom penh
4421569 my family is poor so without the option of living at the temple i could never achieve my dream of attending university
4421570 it is quiet here and good for studying the monks always give us good advice
4421571 i have family in phnom penh but i dont want to live with them because they always disturb my study time
4421572 they must come from poor families mainly in the provinces

4421621 we found in insulinoma tumours taken from patients a very high density of a protein called gpl1 receptor
4421622 but this discovery is significant for patients only if we can translate it into a clinical application we have tried to translate it into a diagnostic tool and method in collaboration with our colleagues at the nuclear medicine institute at basel
4421623 we have to understand that an insulinoma is a rare tumour it is present in about four new diagnosed cases per million inhabitants per year
4421624 in addition in a significant number of these cases the tumour can be localised with conventional methods but in about a third of cases it really is a challenge diagnosing the tumours for these people this discovery is very significant it is a niche discovery and a niche method at least at the moment
4421625 first of all insulinomas are dangerous tumours they secrete large amounts of insulin in a completely unregulated way with the consequence that the blood glucose can reach dangerously low levels this can lead to a loss of consciousness central nervous system disturbances it can even lead to death despite the fact that these insulinomas are very small
4421626 and of course the surgeon needs to know where the tumour is located
4421627 another advantage is that the method enables localisation of the tumour during surgery because the tumour has a radioactive signal which we can identify with a so called probe which is like a pen this detects radioactivity in small spots
4421628 die bisherige saison kommt mir ganz anders vor als die vor einem jahr damals spielte konstanz eine gro e rolle diesmal erzielten die top fahrer ganz unterschiedliche ergebnisse jeder fahrer der mindestens ein rennen gewann holte mindestens zweimal keine punkte

4421657 mention any trouble spot in the third world over the past 10 years and inevitably you will find smiling israeli officers and shiny israeli weapons on the news pages the images have become familiar the uzi submachine gun or the galil assault rifle with israeli officers named uzi and galil or golan for good measure we have seen them in south africa iran nicaragua el salvador guatemala haiti namibia taiwan indonesia the philippines chile bolivia and many other places from seoul to tegucigalpa from walvis bay to guatemala city from taipei to port au prince israeli civilians and military men have been helping in their words in the defence of the west

4421659 the miltary cooperation between the countries developed swiftly the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli contributed to this cooperation his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel among the israelis who took advantage of the opportunity were former minister roni milo and his brother shlomo former director general of the military industries brigadier general res gal hirsch and major general res yisrael ziv dov pikulin one of the owners of the authentico company specializing in trips and journeys to the area says that the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers georgian minister temur yakobashvili said saturday yakobashvili is a jew and is fluent in hebrew we are now in a fight against the great russia he said and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own one of the georgian parliament members did not settle saturday for the call for american aid urging israel to help stop the russian offensive as well

4421663 in humans it is very mild so most of the time its probably not even recognised or biologically tested
4421664 its quite a silent virus its not highly pathogenic and sometimes it causes some morbidity in poultry but by and large it is just there and its unnoticed
4421665 id always wanted to do an aboriginal urban contemporary piece
4421666 when this opportunity came along it was easy to jump on board
4421667 i grew up in small towns all over northern ontario
4421668 and there was no drama or any other arts of any kind when i left home i went to western to study business and then discovered that wasnt for me
4421669 i travelled to europe and did some modelling and then i did a commercial for coca cola and i thought i can do this

4421696 montys been a great servant to rugby and it is unfair to put it out there as if i am doing him a favour he is doing us a favour by being there and i think what he deserves is 100 percent support for the 100th game he will play for his country
4421697 we should put a red carpet from the hotel to the stadium for a guy like that who is very humble i can assure you we never gave him a chance he took the chance that life gave him and became one of our greatest players
4421698 after playing only 30 minutes of test rugby this year against argentina last weekend i just want to go out there and play

4421701 i wont listen to what people want me to do only to my conviction i will make rugby decisions and nothing else if it does not go down well i dont care
4421702 its a phenomenal achievement but what sticks out for me is this mans total humility the way hes always come back to his old school
4421703 hes never been afraid that hes grateful for the grounding hes got and hes kept his feet on the ground
4421704 hes a great role model because of his exceptional work ethic his loyalty and his perseverance
4421705 weve loved the weather and the people we always approach coming here to cape town as a bit of an adventure and its been great because the players have been switched on this week getting into the right frame of mind to unleash it all on newlands
4421706 we met a guy last night weve known for a few years from coming here and he has now helped form a namibian supporters club who have all come down for the game
4421707 i think its great to have supporters away from home and its been pretty healthy for us
4421708 its also been a great hotel and the training facilities at bishops have been fantastic its been good for the players
4421709 when the boots are on you should be switched on to the job but when theyre not on you have got to have a bit of balance

4421714 there are probably things in the final film that are in spite of what i hoped to say they may even contradict what i had on my mind which is not that deep
4421715 i only get bothered when im asked about the race issue i dont believe i cant run 100m in 9 99 because im white
4421716 and i dont believe black sprinters think that just because of their colour theyre automatically going to run under 10 seconds without working hard but i dont like these questions because im scared of saying something that might offend black people or even white people
4421717 if you look at the current state of british athletics it is going to need a small miracle america can produce 10 great new athletes a year nine of them might go to american football but the 10th will probably still beat most european athletes the americans wont be quaking that ive run 60m in 6 55 next year in the indoor world championships theyll probably have three athletes running under 6 50 so in that sense we might need a miracle
4421718 60m is not my best distance im much more suited to the 100m and ill be 25 in 2012 which is the perfect age for a sprinter so who knows
4421719 in heaven there may be some evidence down in the lolo forest because thats where we were

4421726 everything tends to indicate that the privilege of the assumption was explicitly revealed to the apostles and that it was transmitted subsequently by the oral tradition of the liturgy
4421727 the political social and religious atmosphere in the middle of the twentieth century influenced greatly the decision of the pope
4421728 mindful of the human misery caused by war of the ever present threat of materialism and the decline of moral life and of the internal problems that disturbed the church he turned to mary confident of her intercession

4421749 administration officials argue that low yield nuclear weapons are needed as a credible deterrent against rogue states
4421750 since there is simply no realistic prospect of a nuclear free world
4421751 nuclear weapons are the ultimate instrument of an asymmetric response and at the same time the ultimate tool of escalation

4421773 we are excited to confirm that pl 3994 can be given safely to patients who are taking blood pressure medications
4421774 as we proceed with an additional phase 2 study later this year we will focus on the heart failure patients most in need of new therapies
4421775 nu172 has the potential to address many of the limitations of currently available anticoagulants given the profile we have seen to date in preclinical and phase 1 testing including its ability to produce rapid and predictable onset and offset of anticoagulation without the need for an antidote its potential ability to work in stagnant blood its predominately non renal clearance and the option to stop and restart anticoagulation as needed during or after surgery
4421776 because of these characteristics nu172 could potentially offer an improved approach to anticoagulation for procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery kidney dialysis and percutaneous coronary intervention pci
4421777 in this study we were able to identify a dose that meets or exceeds the level of anticoagulation needed for the indications we plan to evaluate including cabg surgery
4421778 in addition to supporting our previous proof of concept data the phase 1b study shows that anticoagulation with nu172 can be maintained for four hours which is longer than a typical cabg procedure we are on track to launch a phase 2 study evaluating nu172 in the fourth quarter of 2008 or the first quarter of 2009
4421779 we are grateful for the continued support from patients physicians and patient advocates and are pleased to be able to provide them with access to provenge while we await results from the impact trial
4421780 initial reports and feedback from physicians involved with this clinical study have reported that patients have experienced no adverse side effects from rpi 78m
4421781 this is an important indicator of the success of this clinical study as it provides the medical and pharmacological communities with early evidence supporting the safety of our leading drug candidate rpi 78m
4421782 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4421783 these results represent significant progress of a t cell engaging antibody for treatment of lymphoma patients as single agent therapy we observed tumor regression in patients at serum levels of blinatumomab which are approximately five orders of magnitude lower than serum levels needed by conventional monoclonal antibodies for achieving a tumor regression in this disease this may relate to the high anti tumor activity of cytotoxic t cells recruited by blinatumomab
4421784 this first observation of durable objective responses in relapsed incurable patients indicates the potential blinatumomab and bite antibodies in general may have in fighting cancer

4421900 for the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
4421901 i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning i will thwart
4421902 courage is almost a contradiction in terms it means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die he that will lose his life the same shall save it is not a piece of mysticism for saints and heroes it is a piece of everyday advice for sailors or mountaineers it might be printed in an alpine guide or drill book this paradox is the whole principle of courage even of quite earthly or quite brutal courage
4421903 o rthodox theology has specially insisted that christ is not a being apart from god and man like an elf nor yet a being half human and half not like a centaur but both things at once and both things thoroughly very man and very god
4421904 in so far as i am man i am the chief of creatures in so far as i am a man i am the chief of sinners

4421906 sequoia gigantea or big tree grows only on the western slopes of the sierra nevada mountains in california at elevations varying from 5 000 to 8 500 feet above sea level
4421907 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuits of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men
4421908 over time the mortgage market should continue to improve from its current position the number of products will steadily increase and rates will lower with increased competition between lenders however it will be a while before lenders regain a healthy appetite to lend with the maximum ltvs on offer largely determined by the future decline in property values
4421909 with all the above said it is highly unlikely that we will ever get back to the same levels that we were at a year ago in the last month numerous lenders have cut rates so borrowers looking for a new deal can take some comfort from the fact that the situation is steadily recovering

4421912 men are bigger talkers despite the reputation of women for talking more however more men use the phone for business which may skew the picture slightly
4421913 weve also noted that men dont text as much as women and when you look at the time lag between your male and female friends responding to your texts men always take a lot longer than women
4421914 women use texting as an organisational tool on a thursday theyre generally planning their weekend sorting out meetings with friends whos going to mind the children etc men probably arent in the same mode when it comes to planning very often theyre tying things up on a friday finishing off work and making some late business calls before they clock off
4421915 we irish love to talk and text weve done a lot of research into this and what weve discovered is that communication and being connected is absolutely core to being irish
4421916 we dont have an obsession with mobile phones we have an obsession with being connected
4421917 if mobile phones had been around when i was dating it would have made things much easier
4421918 ive certainly met people whove said that texting was a great enabler in moving things on to the next date
4421919 whereas a relationship may not have gone anywhere in the past now theres the option of sending a text and it helps get things moving in the early days
4421920 the rules are simple never put something in a text that you wouldnt say in a conversation
4421921 this includes texting an ex boyfriend in the middle of the night or sending a text to your boss
4421922 one of them was injury related the other was i suppose strategic or a bit of us trying to do something different with our forward line
4421923 this will definitely be my last year as an escort but i might come back to work there in a different capacity
4421924 ive really enjoyed the experience for the last few years i originally got in to it when a friend of mine filled out my application and said he wasnt taking no for an answer until i signed it there were 440 applicants that year and we both got it his rose actually went on to win the competition which was great were all still in contact now
4421925 its great for the escorts because when it hits 6 oclock in the evening were all in tuxes and for the most part during the day we just have to wear a suit

4421932 ayckbourn has created in very human terms a description of how capricious fate is
4421933 its a dazzling tour de force for great comedic actors and a hilarious description of our chaotic universe it is one of ayckbourns greatest plays and speaks to us vividly about a lack of emotional and spiritual compass that most of us experience today
4421934 the female character makes a decision in the first few lines of the play and from that two quite different scenes develop the play is about those tiny decisions we all make in our lives that lead to bigger consequences its a huge concept and is very difficult as there are just two actors playing a total of ten roles all the characters are very different and it is a feat of memory for the actors to learn about 16 to 17 hours worth of dialogue after a production like this you dont have a nerve in your body because it cant get any worse
4421935 its a great challenge for the director and actors because it needs to move speedily and with nuance

4421942 a little bit of controllability issue in terms of our ability to control the aircraft in the pitch which is the nose up and nose down mode
4421943 we have senator obama on board the aircraft and his campaign
4421944 one year ago the financial world changed completely as the credit crunch took hold today the world of mortgages is a completely different place
4421945 the standard factors which usually determine the rates at which mortgage rates are set including bank base rate swap rates and libor rates are all much lower than this time last year yet the rates on offer are much higher
4421946 as house prices continue to fall and the risk of default increases the lenders are pricing more for risk and as a result these standard factors are not quite as influential on the rates as they once were
4421947 there does not appear to be a single aspect of the mortgage market that has not been unfavourably hit
4421948 we recognise that borrowers want the security of being able to opt out from their tracker should their circumstances change or interest rates rise which is why we provide a switch and fix facility this enables customers to switch from their tracker mortgage before the end of their deal to a fixed rate product without incurring early repayment charges
4421949 mortgage lending activity remains relatively weak and will decline further in the coming months as a result of funding constraints and lower consumer demand the majority of lending continues to be to people with larger deposits which is prudent for borrowers and lenders in a slowing housing market
4421950 youre a touch overrated youre a lush and i hate it but these grass stains on my knees they wont mean a thing
4421951 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4421952 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4421953 where ivins could have possibly stored this anthrax without any employees seeing it or if he took it home why there was no trace

4421957 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4421958 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4421959 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from
4421960 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4421961 obama will work tirelessly to uphold this nations sacred trust with its veterans to ensure they are not forgotten after they return home and he will provide our troops with the leadership they deserve as well as the support they and their families need
4421962 john mccain has been endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
4421963 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall but we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions
4421964 al qaeda remains the most serious terrorist threat to the us as the election nears we expect to see an up tick in threat reporting of varying credibility regarding possible attacks
4421965 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4421966 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4421967 the democrats in the senate are in a tough spot they have 51 votes joe lieberman organizes with them
4421968 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4421969 its hard when youre in a primary election losing is very very difficult
4421970 i think hillary clinton has been very gracious i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4421971 we can have a piece of offshore drilling but we have to renegotiate the terms
4421972 here we have big oil drilling getting the profits not paying the royalties we want to say in a very protected way you may be able to drill here in the context of a fuller package of renewables and when you do the taxpayers should benefit from that
4421973 further there would be no munition fragments that could be used to identify the source of the strike

4421978 it would have been really simple for them to just say pay the interest ive given up the supreme court
4421979 it is typical procedure for the supreme court to decide to decide the big legal questions and to leave it to the lower courts to do the housekeeping
4421980 having said that were going to do everything we can to bring this to a quick and expeditious close
4421981 the legally correct amount necessary to deter exxon and others from future oil spills
4421982 but the reality is the supreme court has declined to rule on this motion by the plaintiffs so we will participate in that process in a timetable mandated by the court its really in the ninth circuits hands
4421983 i think the sentence is a bit light he should face a harsher sentence because he has committed a crime against a child
4421984 its quite possible h9n2 is infecting humans quite a lot much more than we appreciate merely because it is beyond the radar
4421985 in humans it is very mild so most of the time its probably not even recognised or biologically tested
4421986 its quite a silent virus its not highly pathogenic and sometimes it causes some morbidity in poultry but by and large it is just there and its unnoticed
4421987 three or four years ago there was a film in cannes on the great soccer player zidane
4421988 it was about one game when he was playing with real madrid what was amazing in the film was that 20 cameras were on zidane during the whole match i was amazed by it i said this is great
4421989 allowed us to bring cameras which he never ever does
4421990 he jackson allowed us to shoot in the locker room for the game at half time and after the game its just a total look at one of the worlds greatest athletes and the preparation that he does
4421991 it has really turned into this amazing documentary of one of the worlds greatest basketball players
4421992 he was the second coach out there he was directing traffic so it was an amazing piece
4421993 they are both great players but theres only one michael jordan
4421994 all the hard work paid off all the injuries tears blood rips everything pays off at this very moment
4421995 everything just goes away you can only think of good things now
4421996 we came back and we showed the usa is really strong we deserved the top two medals and we showed the world we can come back no matter what
4421997 im still fighting for that medal count with him he has four so i have a few more to go
4421998 its an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him there on the floor exactly 20 years after he competed
4421999 i honestly didnt know until she finished and the scores came up

4422004 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations

4422058 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4422059 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4422060 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4422069 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4422070 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4422071 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4422072 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4422073 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4422074 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4422075 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4422076 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4422077 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4422078 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4422079 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4422080 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4422081 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4422082 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4422083 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4422084 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4422085 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4422086 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4422087 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4422088 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4422089 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4422090 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4422091 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4422092 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4422093 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4422094 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4422095 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4422096 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4422097 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4422098 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4422099 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4422100 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4422101 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4422102 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4422103 who are open to doing something on the production side
4422104 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4422105 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4422106 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4422107 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4422108 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4422109 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4422110 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4422111 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4422112 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4422113 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4422114 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4422115 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4422116 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4422117 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4422118 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4422119 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4422120 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4422121 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4422122 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4422123 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4422124 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4422125 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4422126 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4422127 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4422128 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4422129 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4422130 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4422131 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4422132 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4422133 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4422134 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4422135 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4422136 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4422137 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4422138 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4422139 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4422140 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4422141 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4422142 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4422143 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4422144 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4422145 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4422146 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4422147 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4422148 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4422149 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4422150 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4422151 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4422152 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4422153 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4422154 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4422155 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4422156 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4422157 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4422158 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4422159 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4422160 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4422161 every day shelter is seeing more and more ordinary hardworking people who are terrified of losing their homes theyre being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4422162 tens of thousands are living with the fear of having the home theyve worked so hard for being repossessed by lenders with little compassion
4422163 lenders must play their part and ensure they look at all the options before rushing to the court and use repossession as the last rather than first option
4422164 the government needs to show it really is on peoples side when they are facing the threat of repossession
4422165 while we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4422166 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort
4422167 we are really pleased because this has been a difficult year for us and the pupils we get here often do not have a good starting point so what they have achieved is fantastic
4422168 i am very pleased with the achievements of the students and staff they were a year group which was also talented in sport music and art as shown not only by the 100pc grade a results in art music and p e a levels but also their art exhibitions concerts and match results
4422169 we are so pleased and delighted with these results they are extremely good of us and demonstrates just how hard the students have worked
4422170 i really cannot speak i am so shocked by this absolutely ecstatic it has most defiantly not been easy it has been a lot of hard work
4422171 many students exceeded their expected grades as a result of the close monitoring and target setting that is a feature of sixth form work here
4422172 we are very pleased with this news it shows that the school is once again on the up
4422173 this has been a really exceptional year for us in fact it is the best year yet and we have also had a record number of students getting into their first choice of universities
4422174 we are absolutely delighted that many of our students have done extraordinarily well we congratulate them on their success and their commitment and dedication we also extend our thanks to the families who have helped supported students through their studies
4422175 we are extremely pleased last year we had our best ever results which placed us in the top 5pc of sixth forms nationally and this years are very similar
4422176 the overall pass rate is down a little on last year but that does happen depending on the year group i am pleased that the pupils who worked hard have got really grades
4422177 all the hard work paid off all the injuries tears blood rips everything pays off at this very moment
4422178 everything just goes away you can only think of good things now
4422179 we came back and we showed the usa is really strong we deserved the top two medals and we showed the world we can come back no matter what
4422180 im still fighting for that medal count with him he has four so i have a few more to go
4422181 its an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him there on the floor exactly 20 years after he competed
4422182 i honestly didnt know until she finished and the scores came up
4422183 the uv source used to pre sensitise the mice is a very poor surrogate for sun exposure said brian diffey an emeritus professor at newcastle university in britain
4422184 oh my gosh ive been up until 12 30 in the morning almost every night
4422185 but we watch it live and record it so we can go back and watch it again later
4422186 its been a long time since a swimmer has been a poster child of the olympics like this
4422187 it really raises the level of awareness about swimming both for the casual lap swimmer and for kids interested in learning to swim but it also increases interest in competitive swimming
4422188 its something that michael said he wanted to do four years ago and hes certainly managed to do that
4422189 its what everybody talks about when they come into the pool
4422190 weve talked about the relay where we beat france and how far michael phelps torpedoes under the water doing dolphin kicks when the rest of the swimmers are already above water and hes still down there looking up at them it just makes people more excited about swimming especially the young ones who are just learning
4422191 i just learned how to dive off the side and im practicing diving off the blocks now
4422192 this year i started to become fast and sometimes when im in a good mood and a happy mood and a confident mood i try to swim fast and good like michael phelps
4422193 usually id be out doing other things playing sports with friends or going to see a movie
4422194 but ive been staying in to watch the olympics just to see michael
4422195 i dont want someone to tell me the next day what happened i want to experience it first
4422196 to know someone just going to the olympics is so absolutely incredible and exciting but this is just hard to explain its so motivational and hes just so michael
4422197 i think the visual of seeing so much excitement about swimming combined with higher summer temperatures it makes people think about having a pool
4422198 wrap text in a box word by word as it scrolls in

4422204 estamos molestos y lamentamos que la titular de fomento la ministra lvarez venga a mallorca convoque a la prensa para visitar el aeropuerto y la capitan a mar tima y no se digne a hacer una reuni n con la conselleria de movilidad y ordenaci n del territorio y por extensi n con el govern balear cuando existen temas tan importantes para nuestras islas
4422205 hace mucho que pedimos una entrevista con fomento para poder tratar la financiaci n del tranv a de la bah a de palma que qued fuera del convenio ferroviario y es algo urgente para baleares
4422206 que no se excluya a baleares de las inversiones que le corresponden
4422207 tras la pol mica de cogesti n por excluir en un principio a los aeropuertos de baleares de este proceso de primera l nea y despu s de la visita del presidente rodr guez zapatero venir y no especificar qu pasar con nuestros aeropuertos es lamentable
4422208 no est n en primera l nea del proceso de cogesti n que quiera desarrollar el gobierno estatal
4422209 nuestra capacidad de decisi n en nuestros aeropuertos es mucho m s justificable que la de madrid y catalu a
4422210 por el n mero de visitantes de un aeropuerto es un planteamiento totalmente equivocado

4422213 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4422214 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4422215 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
4422216 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
4422217 a number of girls were on the short list for the show and lin was the best actress while yang had the best voice
4422218 so at the end of the day they decided to have both
4422219 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded foots may have been used
4422220 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
4422221 the moons shadow also a signal blind area could cause a power shortage in freezing temperatures
4422222 it needs to be a formal ceasefire which is what we are working on
4422223 but in order to get to that point there really does have to be important clarifications on a couple of these points in the ceasefire in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected
4422224 because the united states would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests are not protected
4422225 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4422226 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4422227 she has a good group but i dont think she can win the champions if she reach quarters o eights stage hence if she get ahead of qualification would have done already too much a final victory would be resemble a miracle
4422228 she has a great coach mourinho will win everything in next 3 4 years he has two house sized testicles and if he says he will win you have to trust him
4422229 a recent lunch amp learn session where we had lessons on making summer cocktails
4422230 my engineering firm moved to a 40 hour week to make our time more productive this makes anything more than half an hour for lunch very difficult its also harder to hold off the snacks
4422231 coming back from yen restaurant in the rain one lunchtime
4422232 were being very unhealthy by each eating four double cheeseburgers stacked on top of each other
4422233 after workout snack is boiled egg trail mix bar and banana lunch at desk is cucumber salad and two pork cutlets
4422234 not only do i live and work in central london i get to go to our pool across the road at lunchtime and swim for 45 minutes a fantastic stress buster
4422235 im getting a little tired of that tag around our neck
4422236 we are a lot more competitive than people give us credit for we challenge anyone on like items
4422237 they dont see those center store categories as being so important
4422238 chi se ne frega di ferragosto tra un mese inizia la scuola
4422239 i graduated from the training more confident armed and equipped to start what i have learned
4422240 the made in scotland showcase will be a fantastic shop window for scottish based performing artists
4422241 during the festivals we attract culture lovers from around the world and the expo fund is a great opportunity to show what fantastic performers we have right here in scotland
4422242 made in scotland will allow talented artists who may not have otherwise been able to perform to bring their most ambitious work to the fringe
4422243 the fringe can open up a whole host of opportunities and for scottish artists its on their very doorstep
4422244 made in scotland will provide financial and developmental support so scottish dance and theatre artists can present their work in the best possible way at the fringe and open up other touring opportunities
4422245 we are very grateful to the scottish government for their generous support of this innovative new programme through the expo fund
4422246 the fringe has already had one crisis with the box office situation this year and if we lose the assembly rooms the council will precipitate another one
4422247 bill should stop claiming the end of the world is nigh
4422248 i had a message from another member of the family to say they are hurt but its nothing but cuts and bruises theyre absolutely fine
4422249 his parents his sister and his brother were on the great wall sightseeing and it started raining
4422250 they took shelter in a tower on the wall which was then struck by lightning there were no serious injuries but they have been taken to a clinic as a precautionary measure
4422251 george was very confident hes pretty level headed and david is too and his coach mark delaney had coached him very well but david will always have a wee chat with his dad as well to give him a bit of extra reassurance
4422252 the businessman made his money and moved to spain to live the good life our family still want justice for neil i dont know if its possible but i would love to see him in the dock
4422253 we always thought that the men who killed neil were after charlie and got the wrong man now it turns out they mightve been after john
4422254 i cant say if thats true but it may make something happen in the case
4422255 im speaking to the police next week so they might be able to tell us more we just want to know whats going on
4422256 neil was the apple of my mums eye she closed down completely when he died
4422257 it broke her heart and she never got over it she died ten years afterwards but i honestly believe it killed her
4422258 there have been suggestions that neil was involved in the underworld but thats rubbish which anyone who knew him would tell you neil never bothered anyone he only went out that night because he wanted a game of darts
4422259 neil knew charlie from school and they just met by accident in the international bar that night neil hadnt planned to meet him
4422260 weve never had any closure over what happened to neil
4422261 the value of the equity in this property would appear to be higher than that in any other reported cases
4422262 theres an unfairness if one person is being penalized essentially 100 000 versus 600 000
4422263 he suffered a more serious penalty because he bought the property 20 years ago when property on the sunshine coast was cheap
4422264 certainly the more money someone has wrapped up in a property the greater they might feel the loss
4422265 whether its fair or not that individual knew what risk they were taking
4422266 its a pretty strong message from the courts that people could face some pretty significant consequences if convicted
4422267 it appears that compared to other nations brits take personal online material with a pinch of salt whilst clearly engaged with the issue of their own online identity britons are impressively open minded when it comes to seeing others online ict support officer

4422273 from the schools perspective leiths involvement has helped a lot
4422274 my coming here to study was facilitated by the same links
4422275 when i joined we had very little and now we have pigs sheep cows and chickens and it is self sufficient with 750 girls attending
4422276 the idea from the start was to make the school self sufficient and the borehole is pretty much the final and crucial part of that
4422277 the school was originally intended for 450 and now is up to more than 700 and there has never been a proper water supply
4422278 we agreed to donate money to help provide a borehole and other equipment to try and make the school completely self sufficient which would allow it to keep fees as low as possible
4422279 we have sent out a note to all gps with advice on the health risks associated with flooding
4422280 risks to the public are very low although flood waters may be contaminated with sewage or other waste any harmful bugs in the water are usually only present in small quantities
4422281 if you have to be in contact with flood water for instance when clearing up please ensure you protect any open cuts or wounds and wear protective clothing waterproof boots and gloves after cleaning up please make sure you wash your hands rigorously
4422282 floodwater contaminated toys should be washed with hot water and detergent or disinfected before being given back to children for use
4422283 emily needs some more work but her bone structure and her body is amazing i do love marisa too but then there is jane who is gorgeous
4422284 he really carried himself well emily has a great editorial look and could carry off a number of different looks
4422285 it was very very tough everyone had their own plus points
4422286 everyone was a really strong contender im so impressed by the standard east coast is so much better in terms of looks
4422287 i didnt expect it at all i loved the show loved the catwalk but thought that was it i am just overwhelmed
4422288 i feel amazing ive done no modelling before its so overwhelming my little boy dylan is so happy
4422289 it was pretty overwhelming to see them all up on stage what a great achievement
4422290 i killed him it was me it was my fault
4422291 this case has resulted in the loss of a young life and the death of a friend
4422292 it is an example of the devastation drugs can cause
4422293 he went on and on and on and on about taking smack
4422294 the outdoor environment can greatly affect the health of people with copd and this programme allows us to provide these patients with detailed information that will help them stay well
4422295 initial patient feedback has proved very positive highlighting an improved quality of life for many patients with copd and a reduced risk of unplanned medical contact such as emergency hospital admissions
4422296 we are delighted to be able to offer this programme as part of our anticipatory care service
4422297 i am pleased that we can offer this unique service to our patients this pilot demonstrated yet another healthcare innovation being offered to patients in east lothian
4422298 being aware of detrimental weather conditions enables people to plan ahead and avoid situations that could aggravate their condition
4422299 we are happy to look at applications for events at the park but there are a lot of strict rules which may be why we receive few requests
4422300 offering a tantalising taste of malaysias delicious cuisine sun drenched beaches and rich cultural heritage and with a wealth of exciting activities to keep everyone entertained the malaysia pavilion is a unique opportunity to explore the best of malaysia
4422301 were going to be doing a lot of grant applications and well hope to have more days like this fair throughout the year
4422302 id been living in canada for years beside a really nice park and i thought why dont we have a park like that weve got the space for it i spoke to people and found there was a lot of support
4422303 local people are very fond of the park and i just think it will change the atmosphere the play equipment thats there at the moment is old but its well used
4422304 theres been a superb response from locals and weve had amazing donations from local businesses as well the main purpose of the event is to raise awareness for what friends of montgomery park is doing
4422305 these proposals are something which the club believes will not only help take it forward but will also be a huge benefit to the local community
4422306 we are a community club and the facilities we have at the moment are simply not good enough
4422307 if we were able to develop a new stand and new changing facilities it would help us to get into the sfa and that would mean entry to the scottish cup and the associated financial benefits
4422308 more than that however is the pride which local youngsters would be able to take in their club so instead of destroying the facilities they would be encouraged to take part in the club
4422309 there is a willingness to see the clubs long term future secured and as such council officers should continue to engage with club officials to identify a possible acceptable alternative
4422310 how can the police possibly object we are supposed to have a cafe culture in edinburgh weve spent money cobbling the streets and making areas attractive at 9pm the sun hasnt even gone down
4422311 if the police have got a problem they need to address that problem rather than try to ban the enjoyment for innocent people who are relaxing the police need to sort their act out
4422312 i believe that 9pm is an appropriate time for the permission to cease as this will permit the clearance of the public footways of table and chairs to permit free passage of those patrons attending the late night entertainment venues around the city
4422313 it must be some kind of ghost meter as we have not seen it and we have no idea where they suddenly got this from
4422314 initially when we contacted them to say there had been some kind of mistake they wouldnt give us a reason but just kept saying that was our bill and we had to pay it
4422315 when we pressed them they said there was another meter on site they hadnt been charging
4422316 most of the time when they have come to check the meter there has been no one at the club so a lot of our bills have just been estimated readings
4422317 i do not understand how there can be another meter that they have not been billing us for and we really want to get this sorted out
4422318 we are currently investigating what caused this delay and are working with the club to arrive at a solution
4422319 im very concerned about the massive reduction in hours its asking a bit much for people in these communities to only have a service for two hours a week
4422320 this shouldnt be a purely economic decision a post office in a rural area is not necessarily going to have the same number of customers as a larger town but its still an essential part of the community
4422321 its a unique post office based in a village shed at the bottom of the garden it creates some social link for the whole of the village the pub has already closed and were in danger of just becoming a row of commuter houses
4422322 the nearest one is three miles away in east linton and the bus service isnt very regular
4422323 were not going to take this lying down this is going to affect a large number of people especially the elderly and young families
4422324 not everyone has a car and people rely on being able to walk down to the local post office
4422325 theres a very strong sense of community here and the post office is definitely part of it its unfortunate to see another business disappear from leith walk
4422326 i find this extremely sad its a very small village and apart from dalmeny primary theres almost nothing there its not very easy for older people to get the bus into queensferry
4422327 kasey is arguably the top goalkeeper the united states has ever produced
4422328 he is a natural leader and those leadership skill should be of enormous value to sounders fc
4422329 tyrone might have dropped back a bit as peoples favourites but they still have a core group from 2003 and 2005
4422330 the likes of sean cavanagh brian dooher philip jordan brian mcguigan and conor gormley theyre all still there
4422331 if we had a bit more experience or astuteness about us we would have won
4422332 the fact is that tyrone were the better team and deserved to go through and then went on to win the all ireland
4422333 theres a couple of players who are coming towards the end of their careers and the management has been in place for four years setanta readers comment of the day
4422334 a thorough assessment process would need to be undertaken before considering a full scale bit
4422335 lodging an expression of interest however keeps aru in the ball park while assessing what would clearly be a daunting financial challenge
4422336 en un momento en que hace falta inspirar confianza por la crisis econ mica

4422338 el psc est en un callej n sin salida porque pidi el voto para el gobierno de zapatero el gobierno de zapatero es su gobierno donde tiene a ministros como celestino corbacho o carmen chac n es este gobierno el que no est cumpliendo el estatut y como adem s gobiernan en catalu a deben exigir la mejora en la financiaci n que marca ese mismo estatut
4422339 ya que consigui un espectacular respaldo electoral en catalu a y ahora no quiere cumplir con lo que marca el estatut
4422340 esta situaci n no la pueden resolver con trucos de magia hasta ahora han hecho un mont n de promesas para quedar bien con todo el mundo pero al final se han de enfrentar con la cruda realidad para aprobar los presupuestos necesita rodr guez zapatero los votos de los partidos catalanes
4422341 i didnt come here to make the cut ive got to do well to make my card and avoid the qualifying school

4422344 je moet een heel goede reden hebben om met die technologie n aan de slag te gaan
4422345 je kunt niet zomaar achter iedere nieuwe hype aan hobbelen
4422346 ooit it net zo simpel wordt als elektriciteit uit het stopcontact
4422347 een groot deel van de hype draait rond de belofte dat het gaat om een eenvoudige en flexibele benadering van informatietechnologie terwijl de werkelijkheid niet aan die verwachting kan voldoen
4422348 dergelijke grote dromen verwezenlijken is altijd lastiger dan je denkt en het kost ook veel meer tijd dan mensen denken
4422349 ik vind de kwaliteit van de nieuwste systemen heel aantrekkelijk zo langzamerhand onstaat echt het gevoel dat je in elk geval deels met elkaar in dezelfde ruimte bent
4422350 ze beginnen gewoon met facebook of myspace als ieder ander en zeggen dan ja we beginnen gewoon en we zien wel wat voor problemen we tegenkomen als we ermee bezig zijn
4422351 een overzicht van wat er zoal om je heen gebeurt

4422357 ea partners is a truly global resource for the worlds best independent developers whether theyre in north america europe or asia
4422358 presidential campaign advertising should come at the end of august and then i think its going to come fast and furious
4422359 a significant amount of our resources will go to those four states
4422360 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4422361 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4422362 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4422363 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4422364 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4422365 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4422367 this launch is just the start over time we will be expanding our offering even further with more suppliers who are at the forefront of laptop technology
4422368 the moons shadow also a signal blind area could cause a power shortage in freezing temperatures
4422369 under my leadership the cpp government will use state purchasing power to ensure that we eat what we grow and use what we produce in ghana
4422370 it is for this reason that i will challenge apostle safo the suame industrial centre and others to produce a limousine to be used by me as a president of the republic of ghana
4422371 the provision of quality teaching and learning for every ghanaians child is the only means we can ensure the rapid socio economic progress of our dear country from a third world to a first world
4422372 saying while we the cpp government built others only came to sell
4422373 what we negatively do today will always come back to us
4422374 in my view the government has no business in a private entity the governments duty is to provide the necessary infrastructure for the private sector to thrive thereby accelerating national development
4422375 it is clear governments everywhere in the world do not do well running businesses
4422376 the government should have put gt on the stock market to offer ghanaians the opportunity to own it no matter how bad the financial status of gt was
4422377 no company goes on the stock market without some window dressing
4422378 my only problem is that there was no competitive bidding and you cannot establish proper value for an asset without competitive bidding
4422379 if we sell our interest in sat 3 along with gt then we have a single private company that has become a gatekeeper for all its competitors and ghanaians
4422380 that is not acceptable the proper thing to do is to segregate sat 3 interest from that of gt and let the nation own it
4422381 you bid the management contract which could be reviewed at any time
4422382 five business days until wednesday august 20 to pay the penalties
4422383 the suspension for non payment of transaction levy be therefore lifted from wednesday august 13 2008
4422384 that however the penalties under rules 51 and 55 of the gse trading and settlement rules regarding failed trades apply
4422385 shell diesel extra is an exclusive formulation which is designed to give diesel engines extra protection
4422386 it forms a protective layer on the metal surface of the injector to prevent the build up of deposits

4422396 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4422397 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4422398 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4422399 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4422400 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4422401 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4422402 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4422403 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4422404 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4422405 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4422406 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4422407 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4422408 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4422409 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4422410 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4422411 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4422412 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4422413 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4422414 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4422415 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4422416 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4422417 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4422418 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4422419 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4422420 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4422421 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4422422 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4422423 for us to be anywhere close to double digits represented a huge change from the past
4422424 now in august weve had two new polls one showing about a 6 point lead one a 7 point lead
4422425 but franklin said there has been a shift statewide in party identification
4422426 so the upshot of that is theres been a shift in party balance over the last four years that could be very important to the state and democratic candidates in the state
4422427 i think the polls that come out a week or two after the conventions are going to be critical for telling us whether were going to be again one of these competitive swing states or whether the state has shifted enough that one candidate or the other will maintain a lead
4422428 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4422429 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4422430 i can tell you from my experience that most of the time media speculation turns out to be wrong
4422431 im staying as governor whether you like it or not
4422432 the lieutenant governor might not like it very much but im staying
4422433 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4422434 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4422435 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4422436 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4422437 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4422438 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4422439 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4422440 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4422441 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4422442 i want them to know i am sorry it has taken a great toll on them
4422443 somewhere along the way i lost my path i made horrible decisions
4422444 this is a sad case its obvious that you have good skills
4422445 you destroyed the most valuable asset that you possess your good name
4422446 he was not saying oh im sorry i was arrested
4422447 his crime wasnt just ripping people off hes left a trail of devastation in his wake boarded up buildings are going to stay that way for years to come thats what hes done for his community
4422448 had thought a great deal about the potential of the vice presidency carter talked at length about how he saw the office as a wasted national asset he was determined to use his vice presidency in a way no president had done previously
4422449 made it clear to carter that he did not want to be considered if it was to be a strictly ceremonial office he was only interested in a truly substantive role
4422450 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4422451 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4422452 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4422453 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4422454 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4422455 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4422456 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4422457 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4422458 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4422459 the second reason is that anyone would be a fool to follow me
4422460 1but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
4422461 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4422462 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4422463 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4422464 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4422465 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4422466 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4422467 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4422468 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4422469 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4422470 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4422471 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4422472 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4422473 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4422474 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4422475 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4422476 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4422477 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4422478 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4422479 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4422480 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4422481 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4422482 the last eight years have been nothing short of a disaster
4422483 we need a new start not only domestically but internationally
4422484 i am very delighted to see that the obamas campaign has reached out to many community activists from all asian american and pacific islander communities including those who erstwhile were ardent supporters of hillary clinton and john edwards
4422485 is from a new generation of leaders as immigrants to this country we can easily identify ourselves with his life story he is an inspiration for our children born here that is perhaps the reason why so many of young generation indian americans have flocked to his campaign obama has also surrounded himself with many political veterans of indian origin
4422486 each of these individuals are deeply committed to ensuring that the rapidly growing south asian american communities are engaged and participating in this years historic elections
4422487 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4422488 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4422489 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4422490 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4422491 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4422492 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4422493 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4422494 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4422495 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4422496 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4422497 they had the nearest window in the restaurant opened what air there was came through and fanned antonias arms she
4422498 this town sat on a rock rising out of one of those plains of immense france
4422499 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4422500 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4422501 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4422502 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4422503 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4422504 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4422505 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4422506 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4422507 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4422508 who will be the next president of the united states
4422509 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4422510 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4422511 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4422512 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4422513 iniciar reiki os da la bienvenida hacia una nueva forma de vivir
4422514 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4422515 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4422516 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4422517 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4422518 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4422519 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4422520 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4422521 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4422522 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4422523 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4422524 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4422525 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4422526 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4422527 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4422528 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4422529 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4422530 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4422531 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4422532 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4422533 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4422534 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4422535 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4422536 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4422537 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4422538 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4422539 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4422540 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4422541 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4422542 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4422543 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4422544 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4422545 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4422546 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4422547 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4422548 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4422549 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4422550 theres no gas no electricity no water in the city
4422551 its all because of our leadership its not our fault but were the ones who suffer
4422552 were expecting humanitarian help from tbilisi like bread and sugar
4422553 the people who sit in their armchairs maybe they want it but we dont want it
4422554 house classic rock hip hop whatever we can play what we like we can show a little bit more of our personality at the club through music we can share more with people
4422555 hooking up with artists i work with now i can play their songs the night of a show we finish the track here darkers studio and bring it to the club
4422556 and i want to twist it up and the crowd will accept it ill pull it off
4422557 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4422558 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4422559 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4422560 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4422561 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4422562 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4422563 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4422564 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4422565 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4422566 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4422567 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4422568 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4422569 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4422570 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4422571 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4422572 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4422573 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4422574 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4422575 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4422576 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4422577 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4422578 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4422579 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4422580 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4422581 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4422582 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4422583 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4422584 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4422585 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4422586 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4422587 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4422588 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4422589 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4422590 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4422591 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4422592 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4422593 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4422594 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4422595 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4422596 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4422597 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4422598 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4422599 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4422600 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4422601 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4422602 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4422603 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4422604 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4422605 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4422606 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4422607 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4422608 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4422609 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4422610 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4422611 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4422612 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4422613 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4422614 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4422615 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4422616 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4422617 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4422618 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4422619 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4422620 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4422621 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4422622 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4422623 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4422624 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4422625 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4422626 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4422627 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4422628 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4422629 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4422630 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4422631 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4422632 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4422633 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4422634 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4422635 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
4422636 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4422637 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
4422638 quanto ti sar costato abituarti a me alla mia anima sola e selvaggia al mio nome che tutti allontanano abbiamo visto ardere tante volte lastro baciandoci gli occhi e sulle nostre teste ergersi i crepuscoli in ventagli giranti ti porter dalle montagne fiori allegri copihues nocciole oscure e ceste silvestri di baci voglio fare con te ci che la primavera fa con i ciliegi
4422639 besides apps that are used for e mail and personalized contacts and calendar were seeing some additional traction amongst crm apps sales field service there are also sparks of interest amongst inventory management and logistics apps
4422640 from a features and functionality standpoint on the crm apps organizations arent looking for the applications to do complicated algorithms rather they are looking to the mobile apps to provide field users with more customer related information such as service call information that the customer has asked for in the past and what sorts of things that a customer has purchased before
4422641 previously mobile apps tended to be focused on extending the line of business app like crm or order management
4422642 now the vendors are working on making their solutions plug into other systems easier out of the box capability to enable stronger cross visibility
4422643 besides rim there are windows mobile devices palm devices nokia devices and iphone devices that are being uses for enterprise mobile apps from what ive seen rim and windows mobile support the vast majority of mobile enterprise apps that includes e mail i think the chief strengths of blackberries include versatility and cost blackberry devices can support a variety of enterprise mobile apps on the device and device costs range from 100 200 on average
4422644 the browser is somewhat kludgy compared to the iphones browser it can be difficult to navigate and users sometimes must flywheel down to the bottom of pages to access links or enter data
4422645 i chose to put oss instead of devices because palm offers devices like the treo that operate on the windows platform
4422646 there are constraints for some handheld solutions running on different operating systems
4422647 for example oracle peoplesoft crm has a mobile handheld solution that runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry and microsoft dynamics crm runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry so if youre a buyer running those solutions as your enterprise crm apps and want to extend those capabilities out to blackberry devices that youve already rolled out for e mail you face a challenge
4422648 they offer a software layer that allows organizations to extend their crm application to multiple device types
4422649 devices definitely play a large role in managing the deployment of mobile applications from a developers perspective they must take into account the operating system and capabilities of the phone
4422650 for many developers ensuring their software is supported on many phones can be costly
4422651 sprint has a wide range of solutions that can address our customers needs regardless of the device they are carrying most smart phones can support a variety of business mobile apps and most devices are compatible with gps based business applications including several rugged devices that are well suited for tough business environments
4422652 even the most current mobile devices still provide a small fraction of the bandwidth screen size and memory available to desktop based applications
4422653 mobile applications must be designed to function well in such a limited environment
4422654 in addition we launched the oracle mobile business indicators to coincide with the launch of the apple app store on july 11th 2008
4422655 highly intuitive and flexible features including browse search and favorites for a superior overall end user experience
4422656 support for key erp business approval processes with rich analytical context
4422657 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4422658 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4422659 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
4422660 how would the developers in this audience feel if the news media were opining on the benefits of one programming language over another and other people with no knowledge of programming were making strong statements based on what theyd read or heard in the media
4422661 im curious robert whether you are also skeptical about evolution that would be a good litmus test of whether this is a political religious disagreement or a scientific one
4422662 right now your choices are between the scientists who are actually conducting the research and analysis and pundits who are opining on something that they have no data research or proper science to support
4422663 most scientists think that global warming is an issue i think its bunk
4422664 there no agreement among scientists that weather patterns are changing as a result of human activity
4422665 look they are saying there may be the equivalent of war crimes trials one day
4422666 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4422667 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4422668 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4422669 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4422670 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
4422671 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
4422672 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4422673 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4422674 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4422675 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4422676 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4422677 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
4422678 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
4422679 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
4422680 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
4422681 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
4422682 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
4422683 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
4422684 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
4422685 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
4422686 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
4422687 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
4422688 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
4422689 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
4422690 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
4422691 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
4422692 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4422693 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4422694 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4422695 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4422696 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4422697 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4422698 unless the traveler is already imbued with faith and hope when commencing the journey in quest of the safe harbor then yes there will be torment rather than paradise at every turn and ultimately will fail long before reaching even the first port of call

4422702 as far as we can tell from our conversations with the book industry people there has never been a trailer that did this
4422703 when he settles in when there are runners on base he executes pitches
4422704 he gets comfortable gets in his delivery and gets in the flow of the game and really pitches well
4422705 we got all those runs near the beginning of the game so i should have been able to go out there and get outs at a better pace but i wasnt able to
4422706 i felt like i was struggling to get into a good groove all game
4422707 of course youre embarrassed were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that
4422708 our bullpen definitely didnt need to be in there for nine innings i wish i would have done better

4422775 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4422776 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4422777 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4422778 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4422779 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4422780 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4422781 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4422782 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4422783 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4422784 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4422785 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4422786 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4422787 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4422788 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4422789 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4422790 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4422791 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4422792 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4422793 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4422794 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4422795 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4422796 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4422797 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4422798 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4422799 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4422800 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4422801 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4422802 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4422803 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away

4422827 well duh i have a whole team of people that somehow manage to do this successfully
4422828 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4422829 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4422830 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4422831 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4422832 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4422833 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4422834 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4422835 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4422836 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4422837 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4422838 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4422839 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4422840 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4422841 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4422842 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4422843 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4422844 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4422845 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4422846 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for

4422898 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4422899 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4422900 thats why we want to bring out the information now
4422901 there are some things you can do now to reduce your energy use
4422902 we want to sure people are not missing the information that might help them cope with these heating bills that will be quite a lot more than last year
4422903 the wyoming journal last week reported that home heating bills in casper could increase anywhere from 50 90 this winter not just 47
4422904 we should be cheaper than the national average its all coming from our backyard
4422905 why is the price of oil shifting and with it the price of gasoline in ways that seem to make little sense on the surface were using less but gas is not dropping at the same rate that the cost per barrel for oil is hmmm heres the explanation
4422906 they provide an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal

4422912 no one likes to make the tough decisions to reduce or withdraw any bus service
4422913 we are in the horrible position of having to make savings to fund other services which the council provides however we feel the system we have used to assess our subsidised services makes this system as fair as possible looking at cost social need and whether there are alternative services
4422914 the routes we are looking to withdraw have only two to eight passengers on an average journey at a cost per passenger to the council tax payer of between 7 15 and 23 97
4422915 this is clearly a significant cost to the council and in an ideal world we would like to be able to sustain the subsidy in reality of course we cant

4422956 we came in one morning before the soil was in the planters and found someone had come in and tipped them all over
4422957 the few plants that had been collected had been thrown all over the garden

4422959 the service users were all upset and devastated as this is something we all did together and now the project has stopped
4422960 man rarely places a proper valuation upon his womankind at least not until deprived of them he has no conception of the subtle atmosphere exhaled by the sex feminine so long as he bathes in it but let it be withdrawn and an ever growing void begins to manifest itself in his existence and he becomes hungry in a vague sort of way for a something so indefinite that he cannot characterize it if his comrades have no more experience than himself they will shake their heads dubiously and dose him with strong physic but the hunger will continue and become stronger he will lose interest in the things of his everyday life and wax morbid and one day when the emptiness has become unbearable a revelation will dawn upon him

4422965 no public health rationale for invoking criminal law sanctions against those who unintentionally transmit hiv or expose others to it

4422997 one of the things that i said when i met with the governor at one point is that some day shes going to have to stand before god and account for her public service and i hope that shes going to have something better to say than what she does to this point on the protection of the innocent unborn but i said if you go to god and you say well i didnt understand how important this was or i didnt understand that this was such a crucial issue then as your bishop im the one responsible because i didnt do enough to try and make sure of that i told her i wasnt comfortable with that and so i wanted to make sure that she understood what a serious matter this was

4423007 the optimal position for wearing a backpack is high on the upper back with straps over both shoulders
4423008 kids who wear their backpacks in the more stylish lower back position or only use one strap may suffer shoulder pain and posture problems
4423009 whats interesting here is that contrary to popular belief its not just the weight of the backpack but how its carried
4423010 and the pain generated is not just on the back it includes the pressure on the skin which causes nerve pain similar to that tingling sensation caused when a leg or arm falls asleep
4423011 its possible that our subjects alter their posture by elevating the right shoulder thus increasing the contact pressure on that shoulder
4423012 if those postures are practiced over a long period of time with more weight and pressure on one shoulder it may alter posture and produce prolonged pain we need to study this further
4423013 following these recommendations may require conscious effort from the kids encouragement from parents peers and school staff until it becomes habitual
4423014 although professionals and parents cannot often dictate what children should carry it is important for us to educate them so they carry the packs correctly
4423015 parents also need to check what their children are carrying we found that quite often its not just books and school work thats weighing them down but ipods and laptop computers and other things they may not need to carry to school everyday
4423016 markers of abdominal adiposity showed a graded and significant association with risk of stroke tia independent of other vascular risk factors waist circumference and related ratios can better predict cerebrovascular events than bmi
4423017 while gaining too much weight can present health risks its even more dangerous to have the abdominal type of obesity
4423018 a mediterranean diet containing fish and olive oil can lower your risk of coronary heart disease and possibly also lower stroke risk
4423019 contribution of obesity and abdominal fat mass to risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks
4423020 the u m faculty group practice funded this project because we thought it was the right way to care for our patients
4423021 we felt confident we could improve quality but we were uncertain if our interventions would save money i believe that this project will provide many lessons for policy makers as the nation confronts the rising costs of health care
4423022 the innovative thinking and willingness to do whats right for patients regardless of the prospect of direct reimbursement has truly been exceptional
4423023 and ultimately we have been able to show that innovations can pay off in both improved care for patients and savings for medicare
4423024 can potentially lead to false reassurance and may lower motivation to engage in lifestyle modifications
4423025 our goal at sister to sister is to emphasize how vital it is for women to be adequately screened for potential cardiovascular disease
4423026 it is critical not only for women but for their families because they typically are the household decision makers about diet and exercise
4423027 this grant will significantly strengthen the ability of the indiana ctsi to implement its programs to swiftly bring the benefits of research to patients in indiana and beyond
4423028 creating the statewide institute generated energy enthusiasm and commitment to reform from the state biomedical research community this additional grant will help us maintain that momentum as we help organize our partners work together learn from each other and produce results that will help us all
4423029 this network effect and rapid protection against these new tactics is why businesses are increasingly moving their e mail security into the cloud
4423030 the number of people in need of food assistance continues to escalate
4423031 we review our policies regularly and make changes to keep them current and effective we have not yet received the petition from the supreme court but we take local laws extremely seriously and will review the petition carefully
4423032 the pre conception and pre natal diagnostic techniques prohibition of sex selection act
4423033 we dont hold the telephone company liable when two callers use the phone lines to plan a crime
4423034 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4423035 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians
4423036 the fto gene was the first gene to be identified which is both common and a strong factor in increased weight
4423037 the fact that weve been able to show that fto is an enzyme and have developed assays which will tell us if a drug candidate is targeting that enzyme opens up the potential of fto as a druggable target and we hope ultimately to a new method for treating obesity
4423038 a women who is abused by her husband is truly placed in a situation of double jeopardy regarding hiv infection in that his sexual behavior outside of the marriage makes it more likely he is infected with the virus and his abusive behavior inside the marriage leaves her with little control over sex or sexual protection
4423039 those clinicians working to prevent hiv infection among their female patients should consider violence from male partners as an important risk factor and ask about and attempt to intervene in such abuse to reduce this risk
4423040 more critically major national and global hiv prevention programs must include reducing mens ipv perpetration as a key target in the fight to stem the epidemic
4423041 this study should serve as a wake up call to us all if we as policymakers and practitioners are going to be truly successful in addressing the spread of hiv in india we must think of ways to address the all too widespread mistreatment of wives
4423042 intimate partner violence and hiv infection among married indian women
4423043 in our study carotid endarterectomy achieved low rates of post surgical mortality and morbidity and translated into long term freedom from stroke in high risk patients despite their poor health
4423044 the presence of multiple medical comorbidities is not sufficient to automatically rule out this treatment which has demonstrated long term efficacy in preventing stroke in medically high risk patients
4423045 as we listen to the health care stories of families in detroit and across the country we are also seeking their input on our reform proposals and what the country can do to make coverage more affordable and more portable
4423046 we are encouraging all americans to have their voices heard in the health care reform discussion
4423047 this bulletin paints a picture of wide discrepancy between the number of men who take are treated or even die from drug use compared to the number of women
4423048 the fact more than 1 500 people died due to drug use in 2006 is extremely saddening in itself but the fact so many of these deaths are male raises many questions about gender and drug misuse
4423049 the government of japan has been supporting infectious disease prevention for children in sudan through unicef since 2000 i sincerely hope that japans contribution will support extensively to the continued efforts by unicef the government of the sudan and implementing partners in preventing infectious diseases in sudan
4423050 sudan has recorded significant progress in protecting childrens health since the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement
4423051 last year alone unicef and partners such as who have been proud to support the vaccination of 8 9 million children against polio 3 5 million children against measles as well as distributing 910 000 bed nets to protect families from malaria as part of the sudan accelerated child survival initiative we will continue to support these vital initiatives as we help to develop packages of integrated community based health care that are proven to save childrens lives
4423052 my research had revealed that stroke services in finland cost less than in england yet patients have a better outcome i wanted to find out why this was and if we could learn from their success and use their methods here
4423053 we will look at stroke services provided both in the acute and community hospitals across finland and speak to clinicians patients and their carers to gain their views we want to bring their good practice back not just to yeovil but to patients across the south west both somerset primary care trust and nhs south west have shown an interest in our visit
4423054 in the south west we are committed to delivering health and healthcare that surpasses not only national targets but which consistently ranks alongside the very best in europe i am delighted that a clinician from yeovil district hospital has won an award which presents an opportunity for stroke patients across the region and possibly nationally to benefit from her research in finland i look forward to receiving feedback from the study
4423055 an excellent service which shows what a general district hospital of this size can achieve in providing a patient centred service across the pathway
4423056 a lot can now be done to minimise the impact of a stroke a rapid referral to hospital is vital to ensure patients get the appropriate treatment we want to raise greater awareness of the fast test and recognition of the symptoms of a stroke

4423060 all comments made on the referendum were pretty much favorable
4423061 the only concern the sheriff tom templeton brought up was making sure it referenced house bill 1304 to have state police doing the issuing testing and background checks if its passed
4423062 there is no such thing as a good influence mr gray all influence is immoral immoral from the scientific point of view
4423063 because to influence a person is to give him ones own soul he does not think his natural thoughts or burn with his natural passions his virtues are not real to him his sins if there are such things as sins are borrowed he becomes an echo of some one elses music an actor of a part that has not been written for him the aim of life is self development to realize ones nature perfectly that is what each of us is here for people are afraid of themselves nowadays they have forgotten the highest of all duties the duty that one owes to ones self of course they are charitable they feed the hungry and clothe the beggar but their own souls starve and are naked courage has gone out of our race perhaps we never really had it the terror of society which is the basis of morals the terror of god which is the secret of religion these are the two things that govern us and yet i believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely were to give form to every feeling expression to every thought reality to every dream i believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism and return to the hellenic ideal to something finer richer than the hellenic ideal it may be

4423067 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4423068 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution

4423079 the girls were the ones that told me or forced me to do it actually it was a big decision coming from the background i have come from from a show like this and even during the audition process i found it really difficult sometimes even if someone was completely tone deaf i would be struggling to say no in the beginning
4423080 zeta had been unwell for a short while and unfortunately had to miss a family birthday party recently
4423081 the family have been hit very hard by it because she was so loved by them all
4423082 ive known mrs jones since i was born she was a real duchess
4423083 she was extremely popular around here always talking to people very proud to talk about catherine but never going on about it too much
4423084 she had been very fit up to the past few weeks
4423085 mariah looked in absolute heaven as she was dried off she just held out her arms to her side and let the assistants get rid of any water remaining on her body
4423086 they throw that word around like its a frisbee i grew up hearing it because my mother is an opera singer the actual definition is a talented female singer definition two is a difficult woman who is successful i believe so i take it as a compliment
4423087 no one could believe peaches had invited faris round as soon as she got back never mind let him stay the night
4423088 they were a couple before she went to las vegas then she decides to get married on a whim comes back and rings up faris as if what she has done is the most normal thing in the world
4423089 she lives in a bubble and is loving all the attention but shes a married woman now and needs to grow up
4423090 faris knew peaches was going to the u s for work but that was it he feels hes been made a laughing stock during all of this and is only now getting to the bottom of what happened
4423091 walking through the crowd and kissing wife noel gallagher meanwhile joked with the fans that
4423092 christian bale attended a london police station on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that has been made against him to the police by his mother and sister

4423094 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4423095 when we were recording at sound city studios i found it very easy to get drunk and stay there
4423096 i also found it easy to amuse my friends joshua any time hes down i just want to make him happy and nothing delights him more than seeing me on rollerblades one night i got sh faced and long story short when the head of sound city one of the pre eminent recording studios wakes you up at 7 in the morning in their upstairs parking lot and youre wearing nothing but a tank top cutoffs and rollerblades youve got f ing problems
4423097 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4423098 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4423099 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4423100 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4423101 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4423102 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4423103 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4423104 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line
4423105 not that its a good one but i have some sort of reputation and i could f that up doing the wrong thing thats suddenly a consideration thats never been present before thats going to affect everything the trick was learning how to give appropriate time to certain things but what im glad to see is really on this record its the same story two best friends having a sh s and giggles good time making rock and roll
4423106 i have turned a twisted christmas the album into a musical and in 2009 there will be a new twisted sister album its gonna be old school metal songs that are an addition to the show

4423112 setzt ein positives signal dass mein mandant nach so vielen jahren in haft endlich entlassen wird
4423113 ich habe in der haftanstalt angerufen aber wahrscheinlich wird christian klar die entscheidung wie beim gnadengesuch auch aus dem radio erfahren
4423114 mein mandant hat von anfang an kooperiert als er eine ladung erhalten hat zur vernehmung ist er sofort hingegangen
4423115 die ermittlungen werden unabh ngig von der entscheidung des bundesgerichtshofs ber die beugehaft gegen verena becker und stefan wisniewski weiter gef hrt
4423116 meines wissens nach handelt es sich um spuren eines helms einer jacke und eines handschuhs
4423117 selbst wenn darin verena beckers spuren nicht gefunden wurden bedeutet das noch lange nicht dass sie nicht an der tat beteiligt war
4423118 es kann nicht sein dass man sich in ermittlungen allein auf aussagen von terroristen verl sst
4423119 der staat muss doch auch dazu beitragen dass der mord an meinem vater aufgekl rt wird solange der verfassungsschutz vernehmungsprotokolle von verena becker nicht der bundesanwaltschaft zur verf gung stellt kann nicht die rede davon sein dass alles zur aufkl rung beigetragen wird
4423120 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4423121 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4423122 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4423123 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4423124 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4423125 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4423126 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4423127 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4423128 and i aint no preacher but heres my erick sermon
4423129 so eat this black music and tell me how it tastes now and f jesse jackson cause it aint about race now
4423130 walk through the gates of hell see my impala parked in front with the high beams on me and the devil sharin chronic blunts listening to pictures of don imus for target practice
4423131 i know obama would but would hillary take part i feel the pain of nelson mandela cause when it rains it pours i need rihannas umbrella for coretta scott kings teardrops when she got the phone call that the future just took a f ing headshot
4423132 i wonder why jesse jackson aint catch him before his body dropped
4423133 just me taking flight man this album is gonna be real special from beginning to end its gonna knock
4423134 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
4423135 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
4423136 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
4423137 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
4423138 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4423139 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4423140 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4423141 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4423142 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together lynyrd skynyrds sweet home alabama and warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4423143 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4423144 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh
4423145 i just think thats a waste of time and i think a lot of other people do too i just want to have fun enjoy life and have a good time and i think theres a lot of people out there who are just like me
4423146 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4423147 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4423148 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4423149 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4423150 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4423151 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4423152 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4423153 this agreement which puts syrian lebanese relations back on track is an important historical step
4423154 are positive steps aimed at strengthening relations in the interests of both countries
4423155 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4423156 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4423157 i have trained with those boys and i know how hard they work this is their time to make a mark in the olympics but they should train even harder now before their races
4423158 tell the athletes we are praying for them and i wish them the best i am sure the whole team will do very well and make uganda proud
4423159 kiprop kipsiro and chepkirwok are used to the burden of carrying the countrys hopes
4423160 the other advantage is they are here with coach ricky simms who handles them on a daily basis he even planned their arrival time so we are all expectant
4423161 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4423162 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4423163 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4423164 alternative university teaching tactics and strategies necessary to force an end to this war
4423165 turn downtown into one massive reminder to the delegates and the public of what war looks like
4423166 mimic the experiences we force on people in iraq palestine and on the u s mexico border
4423167 la primera gente que us el cementerio de gobero fue cazadores recolectores kiffios que llegaban a los dos metros de altura
4423168 el hallazgo m s sorprendente hasta ahora es una tumba con una mujer y dos ni os abraz ndose entre s estaban cuidadosamente colocados en esta posici n esto indicaba convincentemente que ten an creencias espirituales y cuidaban a sus muertos
4423169 we got a call and immediately deployed at opit travellers inn where the culprit was he was alone during the time of arrest
4423170 i knew that it was a bad deal but i was promised seven million shillings as a reward to take the money to the cashier of opit travelers inn
4423171 the area was gripped by panic one of the thugs was shot and later captured
4423172 we shall not approve this money till government puts in place regulations on how the bond would be used and managed it must also show the committee how it will benefit the majority of farmers
4423173 there is no clear regulatory system to show how the money shall be used or monitored besides it is not going to benefit the small farmers who should be the main target for such huge sums of money but will just be kept in banks waiting for people to claim it
4423174 the youth have greatly contributed towards climate change they cut over 10 trees to burn charcoal daily i therefore urge them to embark on tilling the land to generate incomes so as to preserve the environment
4423175 siamo vivi e stiamo morendo siamo morti e stiamo vivendo
4423176 i am so happy with his performance he was in a tough heat but managed to improve his time and also not to finish last that is a great achievement in an individual sport
4423177 i just want to finish swimming and lead a normal life
4423178 it is not a matter of time i have a chance to do better in my heat because i have the second best time among all the other swimmers in my heat
4423179 it looks as if we think that university is just great for our own children but not for their children
4423180 the mosquito nets will in the long run improve the quality of life of pregnant mothers children below five years and people living with hiv aids
4423181 he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play nothing would have stopped him so that is pleasing
4423182 i have no idea what will happen between now and the end of august
4423183 he knew the consequences of playing tonight so the decision was very much his
4423184 the organization and everything else is just unreal the accommodation the food is lovely
4423185 the recent several days have had very good conditions indeed
4423186 they sit around in small groups some in yellow shirts some in red shirts
4423187 they do not understand the rules of the game they cheer its a little bit funny
4423188 if we were dealers we could make an extreme profit
4423189 it is typical for chinese performers to wear different apparel from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it
4423190 they will wear different apparel to signify people are friendly and happy together
4423191 is a feature of increased awareness in the sports population that doping is unacceptable
4423192 look at how many times our swimmers have been tested i assure you that this is a clean team
4423193 dimitri lezinska the grey goose vodka brand ambassador based in london inaugurated the pour masters program in 2007
4423194 mom why do you squeeze them if you just add water back in with the vinegar
4423195 you were the one who wanted to know how i make them
4423196 i should have named the squad on tuesday but wakabi had fever and didnt train on monday
4423197 we were also yet to get a final word from the doctor about soitas thigh injury
4423198 the team is well prepared and focused on the game my team is good but the kenyans will be tough opponents having gone out of the africa championship this is their only chance for silverware in the 15s but we also have to protect our irb ranking
4423199 i am ready to lead the government into negotiating with these people but they should first respect the law and get out of the condemned houses
4423200 we will fight for the rights of the people until they are assisted
4423201 why obstruct development we should support it and then engage the government in the plight of these poor people
4423202 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4423203 un camino hacia una ciudadan a merecida es la soluci n obv a que no da a a nuestro sistema educativo

4423205 i predict a mass conversion of paedo baptist reformed christians at the so called puritanboard to roman catholicism within the next five years
4423206 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4423207 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4423208 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4423209 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4423210 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4423211 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4423212 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4423213 yes virginia kansas missouri and the rest of the 50 states the united states did start out christian
4423214 these and many other matters which might be noticed add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a christian nation
4423215 presupposes the existence of god a rule of right and wrong
4423216 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
4423217 smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained
4423218 for the glory of god and advancement of the christian faith
4423219 religion morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged
4423220 i do believe in one god the creator and governor of the universe the rewarder of the good and the punisher of the wicked and i do acknowledge the scriptures of the old and new testament to be given by divine inspiration
4423221 almighty god we acknowledge our dependence upon thee and we beg thy blessings upon us our parents our teachers and our country
4423222 the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget god
4423223 indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever
4423224 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of nationwide foreclosure activity in july posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
4423225 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4423226 in 18 years of taking part in debates i have never seen an incident like this one
4423227 the district attorneys office is responsible for filing charges and that case is still under investigation based on some new evidence that has been discovered
4423228 there were different incidents that occurred in different jurisdictions there was highway patrol there was costa mesa there was newport beach were looking at all of this as one potential case
4423229 the recommendations of the police are taken into consideration but it could be more charges or less charges depending on what the evidence reports
4423230 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far

4423241 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4423242 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4423243 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4423244 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4423245 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4423270 when i left for moscow my coach said to me at the airport remember when you are on the blocks the whole world is watching
4423271 not the best advice for a 14 year old my knees were shaking even during the warm up
4423272 i love culture which makes me wonder why i live in australia maybe barcelona was my favourite because i think i knew in my heart of hearts that it might be my last olympics so made the most of seeing more than the airport village and swimming pool
4423273 the games have changed enormously the villages now are full of things to do shops cinemas computer rooms etc and the food halls cater for all cultures with different areas for different types of food and are now big enough to cater for 10 000 athletes and the support staff
4423274 it seems to be so much more commercial now than ever and security measures are much more tough but rightly so athletes are more hungry to win now for financial bonuses from their own individual sponsors or in some countries the government bonuses which of course has increased the use of performance enhancing drugs that issue unfortunately cant be denied
4423275 i did some swimming early on at livingston road baths loved the fact that it was an odd length pool and very old coventry baths was always really tranquil in the mornings which was such a nice atmosphere to swim in
4423276 when i made the olympics for city of coventry in 1992 i was presented with my great britain tracksuit and your swimming coach also comes and stands on the rostrum
4423277 this was great but it had been such a long journey from 1980 to 1992 i wish all my coaches had been there as each and every one of them had contributed to my success
4423278 it means everything to me i was in new zealand working at the british amp irish lions tour when the announcement was made that the games would be in london watching a dodgy television with no sound
4423279 the sight of the brits jumping up and down with joy meant i didnt need the sound to tell me the outcome i decorated the british amp irish lions merchandise tent with balloons
4423280 currently i travel back from australia two to three times a year presenting in schools for the british olympic foundation fingers crossed the project will continue through until 2012 i am determined to be involved with the 2012 games in some way all offers considered

4423296 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
4423297 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season

4423321 were going to complete the microarchitecture for nehalem including the disclosure of a very advanced energy efficient feature
4423322 the best of both worlds high performance and energy efficiency
4423323 when nehalem hits there will be an impact across all of their product lines
4423324 theyre basically polar opposites in message one is nehalem and the other is atom
4423325 on the atom side the rollout has been much stronger than i think they had anticipated
4423326 if ahmadinejad does not accept the accord on which agreement was reached the accord will not be signed during this visit

4423330 whats policy and method of dealing with complaints about harassment
4423331 but what im asking is more hypothetical and informational if there is a set comic con policy on harassment and physical and verbal abuse on con attendees and exhibitors and if so whats the specific procedure by which someone should report it and specifically where should they go
4423332 comic con has zero tolerance for harassment or violence against any of our attendees or exhibitors please report instances to a security guard or the con office in room xxx
4423333 georgia has strategic importance in the caucasus we are determined to do what we can to help
4423334 we aim to bring a new regional initiative and cooperation platform and we would hope to see georgia as part of such an initiative this would include economic cooperation and energy supply
4423335 such a platform would fulfil important functions and help to stop further conflict in the region
4423336 i came to tbilisi to show sorrow at recent events we are following very closely the process because georgia is a friendly neighboring country
4423337 the pipelines have no military significance so why would you attack them unless you want to change the strategic balance in the area
4423338 if it were all over today hed be the greatest olympian who ever lived
4423339 im down to the last two races and im just going to try to rest and recover the best that i can and prepare myself for those two races
4423340 i wasnt planning on the back hurting as bad as it did
4423341 my tomatoes grow from the soil with no additives those from the eu are picture perfect as if made by michelangelo but mine are better and tastier and you can eat them as they come no chemicals
4423342 that is why i plan to increase hectares under apples medicinal herbs and vegetables in the next two years
4423343 we cannot be a major exporter we cannot compete with others in terms of quantity or price we must look for particular market niches for our indigenous products wine cheese plum brandy and to sell our home grown food to tourists
4423344 the problems are small and fractured estates an old and uneducated population dated technology and poorly developed market infrastructure unfortunately croatia has never had a farming strategy to address those issues
4423345 they did not find it profitable to work the land and there were no punitive measures for keeping the land unused so it just lay there
4423346 and prepare for the competition once the market is fully open
4423347 po po wake up wake up i dont know what you are talking about
4423348 tomorrow mamma mary goes to heaven you go to mass
4423349 it is clear to us that the free market does not mean a ruthless market
4423350 this message must be received by all players in the fuel market who should contribute responsibly to its proper operation
4423351 similiar initiatives should be taken by other ministries in other sectors of the economy where the same unhealthy practices are evident
4423352 it really does make the councillors and the clients feel better if the building looks bright and maintained
4423353 despite tuesday being a little warmer the mornings record maximum demand is not surprising with the local wind chill factor
4423354 looking at the temperatures its been a very cold august with the month averaging 6 8 temperatures every day well down on the average temperatures of past years
4423355 traditionally there is that school of thought that boys generally are not as mature and ready as girls but with our jumpstart program now in place it gives us an opportunity to fully assess whether a child is ready
4423356 after those four weeks if we feel it necessary there is provision for another four week period for further assessment
4423357 one of the problems is you have got players 50 years ago and you have got players from 10 years ago it is hard to compare
4423358 but we will get there theres no question about that
4423359 well pick a side and it wont please everybody and it may not please the three of us
4423360 the fact is we havent decided what we are going to do although there are some things that must be upgraded such as the fire mitigation system
4423361 they realised how much water the traditional top loader washing machine takes and and questioned if every piece of clothing really needed to be washed
4423362 apparently their kids really loved it and they then recycled the water
4423363 they are also flushing their toilet less frequently and posing the question whats wrong with yellow water
4423364 other people like shaye morris have been talking to people about reducing water and distributing a fact sheet about saving water
4423365 i was in san miguel in the philippines when our commanding officer walked in and told us the war was over and we could all go
4423366 the only problem was we didnt have anywhere to go at the time
4423367 only 13 countries in which dwelling price indices are regularly published saw prices rise during the year to the end of the first quarter 2008 while 21 countries saw prices fall in real terms that is after adjusting for inflation
4423368 in most countries where house prices are not falling they are clearly losing momentum
4423369 we are quite confident that if present trends continue growth for 2008 will be very close to 4 0 percent
4423370 there have been specific issues which have affected the second quarter like the tourism season which had not fully started and the oil crisis
4423371 no when people asked me had she been married i used to say yes but a couple of days ago i was talking about that and the spirit of god told me that i ought to realize as a minister as a minster that the girl you are marrying had never been married to anyone it said to me then the scripture came to me that if any man believes in jesus christ hes a new creature then it asked me are you the same chris that you used to be i said no so shes not the same woman who married whoever it was this is a different person entirely none of those men know this woman that you know today i said lord thats true because the woman i know today is not the same woman i used to know in the past to tell you the truth this is a virgin i am marrying and im her first husband
4423372 im her first husband it even makes it more exciting i should have known because thats what i teach i just didnt think about it until the spirit of god reminded me of the reality of gods words
4423373 it was beyond me it was my church you know ive never liked ceremonies i told them and my in laws that i just wanted something real quiet but my church people were too excited and they made all the arrangement i just showed up
4423374 when ministers talk about the lord talking to them it creats a picture its difficult for those who dont
4423375 oh absolutely we are very good freiends before we got married and so when things didnt work out our friendship was sustained shes very happy that this is happening to me she used to tell me you need to get married and have children
4423376 yeah i dont want to have more that two children
4423377 first part would be dubai then england france and usa i would not walk alone for the rest of my life i told my church that for ten years i walked alone lived alone gone to holidays alone but it will never happen to me again lai lai i will never walk alone again ive found what im looking for so im at peace ive never danced so hard im ecstatic overjoyed this is what ive always wanted its just that she was not ready to marry me i would have married her since
4423378 a lot of things number one i learnt that marriage is not about infantile immaturity i see a lot of people get married in their 20s or evening their early 30s i do not think that is good for them huh does he mean men ive really taken time to study the word of god and i discovered that the age of maturity for a man differs from a womans and there are certain pre requisite in the scripture that are necessary that must be in place before you can have a successful marriage ive learnt that marriage is more important to god than we think it requires a certain level of spiritual maturity spiritual maturity is not necessarily about biological age because you can be 50years and still be immature an infant spiritually like the things of god they come in time each has a role to play if it is utilized in their position of biblical knowledge
4423379 it is typical for chinese performers to wear different apparel from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it
4423380 they will wear different apparel to signify people are friendly and happy together
4423381 rather than announcing chinas arrival as a modern dynamic country they risk reinforcing the view that the beijing government is comprised of control freaks
4423382 fifty six children from 56 chinese ethnic groups cluster around the chinese national flag representing the 56 ethnic groups
4423383 this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable action in china
4423384 they all gave us 100 per cent in their preparation and the support team has been completely committed but it is not just the disappointment of the event here but the years of work that have one into this which does not reflect the ability of the team
4423385 i hope our funding is not affected margaret hicks the new performance director and i came in only a year ago very much with 2012 in mind and uk sport has always been right behind us they know we are looking forward to 2102 and that we need to make more changes what we have to do now is create more depth in our system and this is not something we can do overnight
4423386 im very frustrated more disappointed than anything because i didnt perform to my full potential
4423387 apart from eating and sleeping judo is all i ever do
4423388 i used to look in the mirror and say thats not what i want to be
4423389 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
4423390 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
4423391 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
4423392 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car
4423393 the program has all of those same things built in were just doing them faster because we have to
4423394 there is no production delay or production consideration it feels like we have an opportunity in the summer
4423395 the question we asked is what is best for this movie
4423396 its been an incredible 13 years at radio 1 of all the shows ive presented dance anthems is the one im most proud of creating and i am delighted that even in our recent late night slot we increased audience
4423397 its time to move on but i have some exciting new radio projects to come
4423398 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4423399 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
4423400 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
4423401 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
4423402 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
4423403 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
4423404 last thing i remember was my wife came out of the beauty salon i took a look at her and said well honey at least you tried and then it was lights out
4423405 im not stupid miss jones i know that aint a frickin pig
4423406 i feel tired all the time my head hurts and im not sleeping what is it doc

4423409 no im german but how did you know my name is walter
4423410 i dont know some woman wanting to know if the coast is clear
4423411 a little lemon and seltzer will remove those pesky ink stains after youve been fingerprinted
4423412 because white is the color of happiness and today is the happiest day of her life
4423413 doc i think im getting senile several times lately i have forgotten to zip up
4423414 my son asked me for the keys to the garage and instead of driving the car he came out with the lawn mower
4423415 why wasnt this character work in the movies why werent any of the these battles in the movies
4423416 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4423417 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4423418 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4423419 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4423420 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4423421 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4423422 against the steelers edwards overcame adversity three times converting third down situations including a 22 yard scamper up the middle to erase a third and 11 deep in bills territory he showed he could go deep opening the game with a 33 yard pass to lee evans and edwards showed great touch in hitting tight end robert royal for both scores including a 13 yarder to cap an 11 play 90 yard drive

4423429 its rare for a whole team of sierra leoneans to go abroad and come back
4423430 it goes to show what sierra leone can do when it puts its mind to it we have managed to stick a feather in the cap for the country
4423431 i didnt want to disappear i want to come back here because i like my country and i want to play for the national team

4423433 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4423434 as a subsidiary of a global non profit company we are dedicated to assuring quality and equity for all pupils and we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools
4423435 however we would argue that the quality of the marking is high due to the stringent new checks that we introduced this year
4423436 we have to rise above considerations of religion and region to consolidate the gains of peace and progress we have achieved in the last 18 years
4423437 we appeal to people to observe august 15 as a black day and stay away from indian functions
4423438 motion capture is data driven you just capture the data and play it back our approach is a simulation in which the starting point is the physics of muscle and tendon movement
4423439 the parameters to control the deformation of the skin arent biomechanical its just cosmetic
4423440 the network of muscles and tendons in the hand is very complicated
4423441 using our technique you can show what effect rerouting a tendon would have on the hand before you actually do the surgery
4423442 for every parent worried glitter will be wandering the streets let me reassure you that mans in for a hell of a tough time hell wish hed stayed in jail in vietnam when weve finished with him

4423446 if for some reason the mission fails the jihadi must not abort but instead carry on alone as a one man cell
4423447 you know it used to be that the face of al qaeda was bin laden and the core that is still the case but now we are reminded about al qaeda on a regular basis more because of the activities of the local cells
4423448 what this does more than anything else is provides people who are inclined to carry out such attacks with the sense that they now have some information and pushes them to actually go through with it

4423464 tidak adil jika kelangkaan listrik hanya ditanggung sektor industri beban puncak penggunaan listrik di yogyakarta sebenarnya baru mencapai 40 persen dari kapasitas artinya yogya sebenarnya tidak perlu khawatir terjadi kelangkaan daya listrik masalahnya listrik di yogya menjadi bagian dari jaringan inter koneksi jawa madura bali

4423469 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4423470 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4423471 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4423472 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4423473 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4423474 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4423475 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4423476 im excited at joining such a great and truly global company as nokia i see this as an inspiring new challenge there is a lot to learn but i believe i will be able to draw on my experience from both a think tank environment as well as from international politics it is a privilege to serve on nokias group executive board and i really look forward to working with the nokia team

4423482 its quite different from the recordings and that is either to peoples wonderment and great joy or absolute horror

4423484 im not trying to win a loudest band in the world contest
4423485 the point is actually the quality of the sound and the spectrum of the sound being covered and the way that it envelops us while we play
4423486 the hardest thing about it is just getting stupid things done like paying your bills on time is really complicated
4423487 most bands when they go on tour its for a finite period of time and so they can say well i can kinda blow some sh t off for a month but when i get back ill fix it we never get back so we cant blow it off
4423488 even the same notes when played by a different musician are gonna sound different
4423489 theres a reason theres two of us in the band and weve chosen to keep it that way
4423490 theres not a doubt in my mind that we would have a different level of respect and success if i was a male
4423491 one of the coolest things about the way that women approach stereotypically non female professions and the same for men is that i think they do it with more passion and more invested in it because it is a harder path

4423742 but if we are to grasp the full value of the materials we must note that myths are not exactly comparable to dream their figures originate from the same sources the unconscious wells of fantasy and their understood function is to serve as a powerful picture language for the communication of traditional wisdom

4423753 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4423754 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4423805 we just could not figure out what roger was doing in the court he proved why he is among the all time greats
4423806 it was a heartbreak for us weve played together so long and it olympic medal was the only thing missing in our showcase we came to it on a couple of occasions and had half chances too but in the end we could not do it
4423807 probably you cannot do much when you have the best player in the world on the other side of the net and with him a player who does not miss anything it was unbelievable the way federer came out blazing all guns it seems they have consulted someone who knows our game very well especially the way they were serving
4423808 it was very disappointing we came here as prepared as we could have and played quality tennis in the last two rounds too bad we could not do it that too on our independence day
4423809 well were going to put on the programs and bear all the responsibilities
4423810 yes you really want to do that you see that need then by all means man well support you
4423811 to make sure that people have what they need when they get here
4423812 im basically just here to make sure the space gets used as much as possible
4423813 of course some resources are in more demand than others in terms of space and equipment but we also recognize the importance of just having space available for walk ins even if we know we could schedule it out and use it more
4423814 well yeah but we just set this up earlier today thats one of the things i love about this place come up here and just listen to some poetry if you want or speak some or read your stuff theres all kinds of random stuff a bunch of people the other night were upstairs watching a star trek marathon just hanging out together and thats one of the good things that can happen here it ended up with all the seats taken as word spread and people kept dropping by and yet im know from my experiences in other churches that if we the leadership had organized the event it wouldnt have been nearly so well attended
4423815 we need everybody to participate in order for this church to run and given that our paid staff is not paid to an extent to where they can be making everything happen and theres not this huge support system there so if the community doesnt do it then this church would not happen because it is such a small church and its such a grassroots thing you do feel very compelled to participate and help actually make the service happen i think because it is like if i dont do it nobody is going to do it because it is such a small group i mean ive met so many people who were like i went to living word three times and the fourth time i was serving communion its a lot different playing in the band its just a whole different level of engagement seeing whats going on behind the scenes not that theres a whole lot hidden i mean its kind of like do it yourself church but it definitely makes me feel much more connected and much more engaged in the whole process and connected to the people there
4423816 i promise that if you combine this silky powder with
4423817 people never say how they feel about others they will always put them down behind their back but when it comes time to meet them they will always put on that fake happy face

4423825 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4423826 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today

4423897 the product industry in india is coming of age with world class intellectual property now being created from india in key domains and end to end design and development services provided to global independent software vendors isvs by captive and third party units in india
4423898 there are skillset shortages especially in product management and software architecture

4423910 knowing exactly where to point at just the right time was critical to this event
4423911 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
4423912 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4423913 a place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment habitable or not we have within this tortured little moon
4423914 isnt it amazing what can happen on a planet that has water on it
4423915 unfortunately this father of one with another child on the way is in a world of hurt at grant hospital and really needs our help

4423919 a liberal is someone who puts his foot down firmly on thin air
4423920 america was built by its radicals the hope and future of america lies with its radicals
4423921 this is the job for todays radical to fan the embers of hopelessness into a flame to fight to say let us change it together
4423922 from militant indians to chicanos to puerto ricans to blacks from all parts of the black power spectrum from panthers to radical philosophers from a variety of campus activists s d s and others to a priest who was joining a revolutionary party in south america
4423923 and their arrogance is the major threat to our future as a free society
4423924 is it surprising that an alinsky disciple such as obama can promise so blithely to increase taxes on ceos
4423925 the best education i ever had and where i learned the true meaning of my christian faith
4423926 camouflage is key to alinsky style organizing in organizing coalitions of black churches in chicago obama caught flak for not attending church himself he became an instant churchgoer
4423927 ethical standards must be elastic to stretch with the times
4423928 all values are relative in a world of political relativity
4423929 an over the shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom lucifer
4423930 a beam of light will come down upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote for obama
4423931 anyone who is working against the haves is always facing odds and in many cases heavy odds if he or she does not have that complete self confidence or call it ego that he can win then the battle is lost before it is even begun
4423932 ego must be so all pervading that the personality of the organizer is contagious that it converts the people from despair to defiance creating a mass ego
4423933 it is the schizophrenia of a free society that we outwardly espouse faith in the people but inwardly have strong doubts whether the people can be trusted
4423934 turn to an extreme chauvinism and become defenders of the american faith
4423935 activists and radicals on and off our college campuses people who are committed to change must make a complete turnabout
4423936 our rebels have contemptuously rejected the values and way of life of the middle class they have stigmatized it as materialistic decadent bourgeois degenerate imperialistic war mongering brutalized and corrupt
4423937 the power and the people are in the big middle class majority
4423938 in reference to police officers plus other forms of disguise
4423939 is simply socialism imposed by stratagem because americans have never believed in marxist economics saul alinsky understood this and his ghost is alive and well and threatening to haunt the white house
4423940 chi ha 2 pollici e se ne frega di quello che dici bob kelso
4423941 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4423942 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
4423943 we should tax what we burn not what we earn
4423944 meanwhile the war in iraq continues and now the war in afghanistan appears to be getting worse
4423945 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
4423946 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat

4423973 im very proud of my past profession being in the movies and this is where we shot several of the movies and always had a great time
4423974 but are in fact two different perspectives on the one unified context
4423975 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share
4423976 every now and then ill stay if we have something early in the morning we have to do
4423977 i would hope that the conservatorship stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at the time where britney is at that time
4423978 it made no sense for that trial to proceed so we worked out an agreement
4423979 the agreement says that on oct 1 well probably get another overnight and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship
4423980 kevin has a wonderful heart i dont agree with giving him more money he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
4423981 step up 2 both of the movies were really good
4423982 esto mueve la frontera del conocimiento y no es una forma de decir es as literalmente entramos en una regi n de energ a nunca antes estudiada del modo en que vamos a hacerlo
4423983 se inyectaron 10 000 toneladas de helio l quido para llevar 1600 imanes superconductores a unos grados por encima del cero absoluto es decir a 270 c

4423987 i have nothing but positive things to say about the fair weve kind of become an institution there
4423988 it takes people a few songs to digest it and then once we ease them in they enjoy it and can really get into it
4423989 theyre very energetic and positive it may be because a lot of them are of irish decent too
4423990 a lot of the songs were written up to 2 years before the album began there are also intimate acoustic sessions that you cant get on a larger scale on the record
4423991 on day 12 of the fair i can step away for a while and eat fried cheesecake to get me through those final shows

4423993 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4423994 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4423995 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4423996 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4423997 i think us 112 is still a key support level for oil
4423998 weve found that octopuses effectively have six arms and two legs
4423999 teaching is a technical activity knowledge is static good practice is universal being prepared to teach is knowing subject matter and pupil learning is equal to higher scores on high stakes tests
4424000 all people for meaningful work and for free and equal civic participation in a democratic society
4424001 aims to evaluate the appropriateness of our relationships to each other and to our socio ecological places and to pursue the kind of social action that improves the social and ecological life of places near and far now and in the future
4424002 is that i will never have anything to do with war
4424003 even the derricks by which they erected great scissor rafters weighing a ton each were of the students own contriving
4424004 demonstrated a graduates preparation and readiness for leadership in a school a community project a social agency an industrial organization or some other place where education can aid in the reconstruction of human society 33
4424005 can face and welcome the fact that they can change their environment that their own actions can be those of social reconstruction
4424006 the adult learns by the same process as the child
4424007 what do i know about that nothing how do i feel about that
4424008 conflict episode analysis with reference to present racial tensions in the south
4424009 telling how being tired and disgusted she took that first step which resulted in the montgomery bus boycott
4424010 a story which i write down then they learn to read the story
4424011 teachers do not tell but ask this is the art of teaching
4424012 morris made the decisions and then spent sometimes hours or even days trying to get the one or two dissenters to agree
4424013 those of us who live in the twentieth century are privileged to live in one of the most momentous periods of human history
4424014 with the masses of the people who have found new dignity and unity in their constructive protest against injustice
4424015 i caught myself feeling revolted and i was so ashamed
4424016 electro glass is a highly respected company known for its honesty
4424017 if they truly believed the shipments were in violation of the law
4424018 it will be genuinely unfortunate if they are forced to close their doors
4424019 that products for military use arent being sold to countries that might have an improper and criminal use for the product
4424020 because companies that violate federal law are the type of company that the government does not want to continue in that particular business
4424021 in 2004 they were charged with a criminal offense because they knowingly willfully violated the federal statute
4424022 i think you can sometimes sense especially when he is interviewing alex salmond that he has a difficulty about scotland and scottish culture and it is possible that might be contributing to his views on burns
4424023 burns is a subtle and consummate poet and i dont think we need to worry about what jeremy paxman says about him
4424024 one of the fine things about burns is that he was not sentimental
4424025 of course he wrote a lot of trash but at his best he respected ordinary people and took their feelings seriously
4424026 divided between satire and sentimentality explosive vernacular and insipid english vigorous bawdry and pietistic moralising who was prevented from writing sustained poetry of the very highest sort
4424027 jeremy paxman should spend more time reading burns as burns wrote in to a louse o wad some powr the giftie gie us to see oursels as others see us in light of his daft comments about burns jeremy looks like a gowk
4424028 i have noticed that something very troubling has happened theres no other way to put this their pants no longer provide adequate support
4424029 the scots have too much power and influence in english affairs
4424030 for non lawgeeks this wont seem important but this is huge
4424031 in non technical terms the court has held that free licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer
4424032 determined that the terms of the artistic license are enforceable copyright conditions
4424033 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted materials
4424034 open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace few could have imagined just a few decades ago
4424035 although the reasoning is limited to the artistic licence and the interpretation of each open source licence will depend on the wording of its provisions this decision is a welcome change
4424036 the federal court recognised that even though licensors give up some rights it doesnt mean they have any less rights to access the remedies our law provides
4424037 this opinion demonstrates a strong understanding of a basic economic principle of the internet that even though money doesnt change hands attribution is a valuable economic right in the information economy
4424038 cate asemenea sali de sport s au mai construit dupa 2004
4424039 in weekenduri si vacante sa se dea altfel de teme de culturalizare gen mersul la opera vizite la muzeu sau voluntariat
4424040 e nevoie de un acces mai bun la invatamant si de sporirea calitatii invatamantului si nu numai in perioada preuniversitara ci daca e posibil pe tot parcursul vietii in primul rand e vorba de reforma curriculara iar scolile trebuie sa se bucure de o mai mare atentie din partea autoritatilor trebuie sa investiti mai bine si mai mult profesorii sunt si ei importanti sunt parteneri cheie fara ei reforma nu e posibila ca aveti calculatoare sau nu ca aveti mai multi copii intr o clasa acestea sunt lucruri importante insa ceea ce conteaza pentru calitatea invatamantului este calitatea profesorilor
4424041 i accuse the government of russia of a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing
4424042 weve received 14 000 reports of brutal attacks slaughter rapes and internment of people in violation of the rules of the geneva convention and international humanitarian law
4424043 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4424044 we are still in the negotiating process russians are trying to justify their invasion and to legalize their presence in georgia
4424045 i think we should take a closer look at it the peace agreement
4424046 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4424047 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the u n security council
4424048 broadcast as well as online tv platforms are growing at the same time their growth greatly depends how they fulfill the needs for their viewers and they can also help to promote each other
4424049 for students who began at four year institutions and expected to attain a bachelors degree
4424050 borrowers who dropped out were twice as likely to be unemployed as borrowers who received a degree and more than ten times as likely to default on their loan
4424051 provide an alert to policymakers and educational leaders who can hardly be satisfied when so many students leave school with no credential a debt to repay and a high risk of defaulting on that debt or with no debt no degree and therefore little gain in earning power to offset the time and money invested in postsecondary education
4424052 to establish policies and programs to better prepare support and guide students especially low income students in completing their degrees
4424053 to assist students in making appropriate decisions about the use of loans to finance the costs of their postsecondary education
4424054 it is reasonable to conclude that a college degree is not as valuable as has been claimed
4424055 overwhelm the average earnings growth of the typical graduate especially when considering that global competition and the outsourcing of technical and white collar jobs is putting downward pressure on many college graduates earnings
4424056 could the cost of higher education in the current form have reached a level too high for a positive economic return to society as a whole as well as the individual
4424057 vi ska k mpa till slutet tills den sista ryske soldaten l mnar georgisk mark och detta land ska inte tryckas ned p kn n got mer vi ger inte upp vad som n h nder

4424061 yet what do our brethren do in palestine just the very opposite serfs they were in the lands of the diaspora and suddenly they find themselves in unrestricted freedom and this change has awakened in them an inclination to despotism they treat the arabs with hostility and cruelty deprive them of their rights offend them without cause and even boast of these deeds and nobody among us opposes this despicable and dangerous inclination
4424062 it is awful that something like this can happen in the town
4424063 it happened at about twenty past five and as i understand it this woman was just looking in the bookshop next door when she was shot
4424064 it is hard to believe that anyone could think of doing something like that
4424065 we are normally coming out at about that time of day and the thought that any of us could have been shot is terrible its awful
4424066 cet accord international met fin toutes les questions en suspens entre tripoli et washington il ouvre la voie des relations normales et sans entraves entre la libye et les etats unis

4424068 i guess they won their super bowl rings in training camp because they didnt win it last year
4424069 play the role of the underdog as well as anyone
4424070 it makes you want to go out and earn it again
4424071 when everyones praising you all the time you start to believe it
4424072 i want to know why we werent more consistent last season
4424073 why did we have to wait for those last five games to play like that
4424074 our proposal is a response to the changes our business is facing and the highly competitive nature of the market we operate in we are seeking to secure alternative roles for colleagues based on their experience and the roles available
4424075 we are delighted to be working with brigantia and its members
4424076 we are enjoying exceptional demand for our products and expect continued significant growth in order to cater for this we require a strong channel with partners who can work with us
4424077 the mp3 floating around was the result of a late night jam session and something we did for a bit of a laugh featuring a blues riff we have been playing live recently upon which skinner recorded some vocals it is not intended to be a serious release so we are happy for it to be leaked unofficially
4424078 ive finally done it i finally bought the legendary 909 drum machine i always wanted im bringin it home for the final streets album not this one you might have to wait two years for this shit its gonna be called computers and blues and its all about dancing and chatting shit 45 minutes of 130 bpm style straight spittin
4424079 youll get to see the whole video when it drops soon
4424080 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4424081 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4424082 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4424083 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4424084 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4424085 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4424086 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4424087 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4424088 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4424089 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4424090 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4424091 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4424092 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4424093 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4424094 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4424095 i plead that we let the government do its work on the report
4424096 the uganda constitution recognizes kadhi courts but they have never been established
4424097 the manifesto was prepared at a time when the president the speaker the ccm secretary general and the prime minister were all christians what a coincidence
4424098 why doesnt he cite the example of kenya whose population is predominantly christian but they have the courts
4424099 there is no need of fear establishment of kadhi court is a ccm election pledge
4424100 all have equal rights why should joining oic wait for its go ahead from the church
4424101 the majority of the population in mbozi are christians let us leave the government do its job
4424102 it reaches a point that people who are listening to us are getting divided we would not want to see the nation divided
4424103 the arguments which are going on now are not healthy for our country i think we need to be patient
4424104 valid under venezuelas constitution as with any tool of democracy it depends how it is used
4424105 you will be more than guaranteed in the hands of the republic and you know the banking sector of venezuela is one of the most solid in the world
4424106 riot police used tear gas as they blocked hundreds of venezuelans protesting what they call new moves by president chavez to concentrate his power
4424107 blacklists barring key opposition candidates from elections and socialist decrees destroying whats left of their democracy
4424108 is acceptable in accordance with the laws that are given for reasons of general interest for the safety of others of society and for the common good in accordance with the provisions of articles 30 and 32 2 of the american convention on human rights this requirement is fully compatible with the provisions of articles 19 and 156 of the national constitution
4424109 objective and accurate information about all trade union social movement and political organisations in venezuela
4424110 support the right of the venezuelan people to determine their own future free from external intervention
4424111 conducted strictly on legal and administrative grounds carried out as part of the constitutional and legal obligations of the office of the comptroller general taken following
4424112 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
4424113 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
4424114 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
4424115 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base
4424116 to set up neighborhood based militias state control over agriculture
4424117 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections
4424118 drive to create a socialist state significantly increase his power and resemble proposals included in a constitutional reform narrowly rejected by voters in a december referendum
4424119 up in arms over a raft of decree laws they say replicate constitutional reforms
4424120 typical of mr chavezs authoritarian streak and will let him expropriate private property without the need for the ans approval
4424121 ambitious decrees which formalize the creation of a popular militia and further consolidate state control over key areas of the economy such as agriculture and tourism
4424122 bypass ing congress in making laws and being back on the offensive after suffering a humiliating defeat in december that might have let him stay in power for life
4424123 accusations that mr chavez is evading the will of the people
4424124 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
4424125 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power

4424131 how can the police possibly object we are supposed to have a cafe culture in edinburgh weve spent money cobbling the streets and making areas attractive at 9pm the sun hasnt even gone down
4424132 if the police have got a problem they need to address that problem rather than try to ban the enjoyment for innocent people who are relaxing the police need to sort their act out
4424133 i believe that 9pm is an appropriate time for the permission to cease as this will permit the clearance of the public footways of table and chairs to permit free passage of those patrons attending the late night entertainment venues around the city
4424134 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie

4424147 theres no reason why you need to offer blanket assurances discretion in police work is something that is routinely part of what cops do every single day and it should be applied in this situation also
4424148 it is their responsibility to act when they come across somebody who is violating the law of some other jurisdiction to assist in making sure that person is brought to the attention of the proper authorities
4424149 i think that the fact that theres a city ordinance in place that makes it clear that services will be available regardless of the victims status also sends an important message to the community that if you need police to protect your safety you should feel safe in reaching out
4424150 i want to know what mr cotta will say to the family of someone in hartford connecticut after an illegal alien who had been in police custody is back on the streets and goes out and commits some heinous crime

4424155 paul and obama are talking straight to soldiers and what they are saying is resonating
4424156 the republican party of virginia has really made a new focus on grass roots politics really getting back to the folks on the ground to do the work to get people elected
4424157 we have a great congressional delegation its about keeping those folks in place its about getting jim gilmore elected to the senate what the republicans in virginia need to realize is that democrats in the senate are almost at a filibuster proof majority if they have a filibuster proof majority with barack obama as the president and nancy pelosi as the house speaker our country is going to look a lot different over the next four years

4424185 were in a mindset of typing in our notes and showing them to the audience in bullet point format with this conventional approach youre disconnecting yourself from your audience having them focus on the screen and not you its an unhealthy dynamic when there is confusion about where to look
4424186 so is trendy bad per se do we never have the phenomenon of good healthy trends like say i thought these examples would be obvious a trend towards green business and healthy eating
4424187 if weve got them in town well work til the sun goes down

4424190 nicole saw that even a clean blanket was out of reach for some of these new moms so she wanted to figure out an efficient way to connect them with companies and individuals who want to help
4424191 we take for granted the basic necessities for some families its a serious struggle
4424192 this is one way to ease the financial burden and help new babies have a good start in life we are only working with companies and products that joel and i would use were checking every product out for safety and all products are bpa free
4424193 the left wing extremism has become a problem for our people the governments priority is to protect life and property of the people a responsibility we understand with all seriousness
4424194 hawaii has such good cuisine there are elements of pan asian american west coast and fresh island flavor
4424195 once the cameras started rolling it was such a blur i dont even remember what we said
4424196 it was very formal there were multiple retakes walkthroughs and then you have to do it again and make it seem spontaneous
4424197 the neelys made it look so easy but they are truly a gifted talented couple
4424198 i dont anticipate the mike and tara show on food network anytime soon
4424199 there are many small cities that become destinations primarily because of a museum
4424200 art doesnt exist in a vacuum its not created out of spontaneous combustion
4424201 contemporary art is the visually compelling medium that reflects the tensions and harmonies of its environment the dcca is unique in its position as a site where one could view contemporary works from the region and beyond given the relatively small size of wilmington
4424202 i think the trick will be to organize well researched well conceived exhibitions that are both sexy in appeal and substantive in content
4424203 shows that stop you in your tracks at first sight but also linger long after youve left the galleries

4424208 people have to go out of their way to visit our downtown church
4424209 because of our belief in honoring many cultures im able to bring a variety of music to the church
4424210 people comment that we can spread messages about love peace and anti racism with music
4424211 this program is designed to represent what we consider our signature creatively and energetically dynamic professional programs but with no limits on style or genre
4424212 we have a lot of top 40 listeners in our church
4424213 so we use more top 40 style music to reach them its working
4424214 the night of all nights the cirque is coming to town
4424215 this is what churches orders religious organizations and countless individuals have said when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted in 1948 and what they continue to say today as they advocate for human rights of all people
4424216 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
4424217 unicode strings should have utf 8 flagged and those without the flag are assumed utf 8 bytes
4424218 get back to the basic and think why perl 5 does this latin 1 to utf 8 auto upgrades

4424220 they have not done these awful things because they are bad conservatives

4424224 we have to get him ready to go to jesus
4424225 there are no excuses for this to happen to any baby
4424226 this is murder he had no reason to die he died because he cried
4424227 i mean not only did crystal and craig lose a son but crystal lost a husband and craigs parents lost a son and a grandson one day this was a happy perfect family and the next day its been devastated
4424228 maybe they both could have used a meeting that night
4424229 like two telephone poles with the lines between them cut
4424230 they pulled together they prayed together they took baby camryn off life support together
4424231 and that was a wonderful thing that they were able to pull together like that despite craig being alleged to have done these things
4424232 i dont care what craigs family members think he did this to my son may he get what he deserves maybe people should talk more about camryn than craig craigs name has no worth to even be mentioned
4424233 the question becomes if that autopsy is accurate if this child has been severely injured to the point that his ribs were fractured on prior occasions multiple occasions how come no one knew that
4424234 he only made the confession after the detectives involved started talking about other possibilities of how this child could have been injured what other folks in the household could have injured him then craig quickly took responsibility
4424235 no matter what happens craig is going to very likely spend the majority of his adult life in prison
4424236 if thats the breadwinner or the main breadwinner then youve got some serious financial problems right off the bat
4424237 i lost my job because of this because i couldnt work enough hours now i have to move into a smaller place
4424238 it will be the basis for divorces itll be the basis for the kind of family conflict that then brings into play maternal and paternal grandparents and the extended family on both sides and we end up with a lot of conflict
4424239 i cant have hate eat me up and beat me down i cant live like that
4424240 i will have to one day forgive him so that i might find peace
4424241 michael has lots of potential he is real quality and could be a real legend at windsor park
4424242 the target is always to emulate or better what we have done from previous seasons
4424243 now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you
4424244 even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place and labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the off scouring of all things unto this day
4424245 behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved
4424246 therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head
4424247 if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed

4424258 we have two hands so that each can hold a flag for the countries we want to win
4424259 javier and penelope are very serious actors i always find that amusing they are so great and like most serious actors such as robert de niro they think they are great because they do all that work
4424260 they are born great they are great when they wake up in the morning they dont have to do all that work and they would still be great
4424261 i never talked to them about the plot or anything i just show up and do it i get a lot of great performances simply by hiring great people
4424262 its just horrid there are so many of them right now theyre fake and mediocre and theyre only doing standards because they cant do anything else
4424263 i think there arent enough critics out there who really know so the bar has dropped
4424264 nowadays its like if you sound like someone else thats good enough for me it all comes down to mediocrity
4424265 the really great singers are the people who when you hear them you feel them and what theyre singing
4424266 i really wanted to get back to my jazz roots and was looking at doing a cutting edge jazz record
4424267 but over the last year and a half every time spirits of havana was shown id get e mails from people raving about desandann
4424268 it got me thinking about the human voice the nurturing quality of a really beautiful voice
4424269 i find that that takes us back to our mothers and how their voices make you feel safe
4424270 i almost cancelled the project because we were racking up bills on our credit cards and it was scary as all hell
4424271 then we got a call from banff offering me a scholarship and to cover all the musicians expenses that was a real blessing
4424272 and then i got a grant from canada council and that gave me a boost
4424273 when i first heard them i felt tears running down my face
4424274 they were performing in this tiny church like space and i was standing about five feet away from them
4424275 if your hand is second or third best going in thats where its likely to finish
4424276 i dont think its something that anyone will duplicate ever again
4424277 thats what i want more than anything else to do things that no one has ever done before thats why pulling this off meant so much to me
4424278 the full tilt hosts of the events jens voertmann and michael craig are both friends of mine so i wanted to give both of them a shot
4424279 i had every intention of doing very well in the h o r s e tournament i think i have the best roi razz out there so i liked my chances from the beginning but the turbo tournament was a different story i just happened to get some great cards and i played really well everything just kind of came together for me
4424280 michael craig called me after the turbo tournament to congratulate me and i told him that i wasnt done
4424281 i just had a very good feeling that i was going to be able to pull off two wins in one night
4424282 i want to become the first american to win a world series of poker europe bracelet
4424283 and i think i have a good shot of doing it

4424285 debo innumerables horas felices a la lectura de las obras de russell cosa que no puedo decir de ning n otro escritor cient fico contempor neo con la excepci n de thorstein veblene
4424286 en reconocimiento a sus multifac ticas e importantes obras en las cuales se ha mostrado consistentemente como campe n de la humanidad y de la libertad del pensamiento
4424287 observo que una gran parte de la humanidad no cree en dios y no sufre castigos visibles en consecuencia y si hubiera un dios pienso que ser a muy improbable que l tuviera una vanidad tan recelosa como para sentirse ofendido por aquellos que dudan de su existencia
4424288 si todo tiene que tener una causa entonces dios debe tener una causa si puede haber algo sin causa tan bien podr a ser el mundo como dios de modo que ese argumento no puede tener ninguna validez
4424289 en cuanto a dios bueno hay una gran cantidad de argumentos que se han ofrecido a favor de la existencia de dios y yo he pensado y todav a pienso que todos y cada uno de ellos son inv lidos y que nadie habr a aceptado tales argumentos si no hubieran querido creer en las conclusiones
4424290 la mayor a de las personas cree en dios porque se les ha ense ado desde la m s temprana infancia a hacerlo y sta es la raz n principal luego creo que la siguiente raz n m s poderosa es el deseo de seguridad una especie de sentimiento de que hay un gran hermano que cuidar de uno esto juega un muy profundo papel en influir en los deseos de las personas de creer en dios
4424291 ahora tomemos toda la cuesti n de la peligrosa condici n en que se encuentra el mundo constantemente recibo cartas de personas que dicen oh dios cuidar de eso pero l nunca lo ha hecho en el pasado y no s por qu piensan que lo har en el futuro
4424292 he observado que la creencia en la bondad de dios es inversamente proporcional a la evidencia cuando no hay ninguna evidencia en absoluto a su favor la gente lo cree y cuando las cosas van bien y uno podr a creer en ella no lo hacen
4424293 a veces me escandalizan las blasfemias de aquellos que se creen piadosos por ejemplo las monjas que nunca se ba an sin usar una bata todo el tiempo cuando les preguntan por qu lo hacen si ning n hombre puede verlas responden oh pero usted se olvida del buen dios aparentemente conciben a dios como un mir n cuya omnipotencia lo capacita para ver a trav s de las paredes del ba o pero que resulta frustrado por las batas de ba o este punto de vista me parece sumamente curioso
4424294 la religi n se basa pienso principal y primariamente en el miedo el miedo es el padre de la crueldad y por tanto no es sorprendente que crueldad y religi n han ido tomadas de la mano la ciencia puede ayudarnos a superar este cobarde temor en que ha vivido la humanidad por tantas generaciones la ciencia puede ense arnos y yo pienso que nuestros propios corazones pueden ense arnos a dejar de buscar apoyos imaginarios a dejar de inventarnos aliados en el cielo sino mejor a mirar a nuestros propios esfuerzos aqu en la tierra para hacer de este mundo un lugar m s adecuado para vivir en vez de la clase de lugar que las iglesias han hecho de l durante todos estos siglos
4424295 pienso que todas las grandes religiones del mundo son tan falsas como da inas es evidente como cuesti n l gica que ya que discrepan entre s no m s que una de ellas puede estar en lo cierto con muy pocas excepciones la religi n que acepta un hombre es la de la comunidad en que vive lo que hace obvio que la influencia del ambiente es lo que lo ha llevado a esa religi n
4424296 el hecho es que la religi n ya no es lo suficientemente vital para asimilar nada nuevo se form hace mucho para satisfacer ciertas necesidades antiguas y ha subsistido por la fuerza de la tradici n pero ya no es capaz de asimilar nada que no pueda ser visto de manera tradicional
4424297 lo que deseo sostener es que toda fe hace da o podemos definir fe como la firme creencia en algo de lo que no hay evidencia cuando existe evidencia nadie habla de fe no hablamos de tener fe en que dos y dos son cuatro o en que la tierra es redonda s lo hablamos de fe cuando deseamos sustituir la emoci n por la evidencia
4424298 creo que cuando muera me descompondr y nada de mi ego sobrevivir no soy joven y amo la vida pero despreciar a temblar de terror ante el pensamiento de la aniquilaci n la felicidad no deja de ser verdadera felicidad porque yo llegue a mi fin ni el pensamiento ni el amor pierden su valor porque no sean eternos
4424299 si no tuvi ramos miedo de la muerte no creo que la idea de inmortalidad hubiera surgido siquiera
4424300 no es mediante la oraci n y la humildad que logras que las cosas se hagan como quieres sino mediante la adquisici n del conocimiento de las leyes naturales el poder que adquieres de esta forma es mucho mayor y m s confiable que el que antes se supon a adquirir por medio de la oraci n pues nunca pod as saber si tu oraci n era favorablemente respondida en el cielo
4424301 la evidencia hist rica a favor de la existencia del cristo humano es endeble las doctrinas a l atribuidas son otro asunto tales doctrinas lo capacitan a uno para juzgar que un individuo hipot tico o real pudo haberlas sostenido algunas de las creencias ticas que se pretende que provienen de l son soportables la alucinante convicci n de que pose a divinidad era compartida por muchos m sticos vagabundos y lun ticos de la poca
4424302 a mi modo de pensar hay un muy serio defecto en el car cter moral de cristo y es que cre a en el infierno yo no siento que cualquier persona que realmente sea profundamente humana pueda creer en un castigo eterno ciertamente cristo tal como lo retratan los evangelios cre a en el castigo eterno y uno encuentra repetidamente una furia vengativa hacia aquellos que no escuchaban sus pr dicas una actitud que no es rara en los predicadores pero que desdice algo de la excelencia superlativa
4424303 toda la idea de desperdiciar la vida ciegamente como un servicio imaginario a cristo es una forma de glorificar el masoquismo y la propia humillaci n ante el poder es una actitud esencialmente oriental que el cristianismo asumi cuando le atribuy a dios los defectos morales de los d spotas m s crueles
4424304 the competition is different i am very competitive and get a buzz out of finding new ways of challenging my mind
4424305 it started when a teacher at school taught us a rhyme to remember i read a few books on memory and started competing this year

4424312 o toalete feminino um local onde a mulher cria uma r pida intimidade se desvenda fala da sua vida dos homens e de sexo com uma liberdade absoluta
4424313 descobri o lado divertido dos encontros das mulheres nos toaletes
4424314 as mulheres bancam de mocinha com delicadeza e fragilidade mas no banheiro fazem muitas revela es mostram sua intimidade n o se contentam com uma posi o passiva diante da vida e s o capazes de discutir os homens com absoluta franqueza
4424315 well i dont know all the words to that song but ill say this were very excited just in the fact that we feel we improved off last weeks performance
4424316 it almost wasnt really a surprise because you see him do it in practice and he came out and had such a command over the offense its a good feeling
4424317 as comfortable as you can feel with two days of practice i think some good things happened though
4424318 he sat there and just smiled and we laughed about it but those things happen
4424319 i think it was a nice start for him well see where it goes

4424323 most that can be done is autonomy it should be done within the framework of the constitution national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of the philippines
4424324 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4424325 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4424326 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4424327 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4424328 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4424329 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4424330 its quite possible h9n2 is infecting humans quite a lot much more than we appreciate merely because it is beyond the radar
4424331 in humans it is very mild so most of the time its probably not even recognized or biologically tested
4424332 its quite a silent virus its not highly pathogenic and sometimes it causes some morbidity in poultry but by and large it is just there and its unnoticed

4424334 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4424335 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4424336 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4424337 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4424338 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4424339 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4424340 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4424341 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4424342 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4424343 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4424344 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4424345 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4424346 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4424347 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4424348 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4424349 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4424350 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4424351 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4424352 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4424353 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4424354 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4424355 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4424356 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4424357 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4424358 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4424359 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4424360 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4424361 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4424362 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4424363 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4424364 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4424365 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4424366 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4424367 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4424368 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4424369 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4424370 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4424371 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4424372 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4424373 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4424374 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4424375 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4424376 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4424377 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4424378 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4424379 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4424380 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4424381 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4424382 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4424383 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4424384 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4424385 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4424386 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4424387 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4424388 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4424389 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4424390 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4424391 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4424392 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4424393 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4424394 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4424395 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4424396 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4424397 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4424398 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4424399 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4424400 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4424401 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4424402 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4424403 the cold front is not expected until sunday night or monday where we may see some thunderstorms it will be interesting to see how close we get to some of the records
4424404 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4424405 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4424406 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4424407 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4424408 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4424409 what people talk about to get to know each other

4424412 religious passion has emerged as a new factor pushing the growth of the real estate sector the spiritual angle has always been a big draw for tourists coming to india for us it is also a marketing initiative that helps differentiate as well as attract like minded people as a developer we get a confirmed customer and he gets some thing that he is looking for
4424413 you can go to school because its safe but dont go swimming with sharks because its dangerous our parents said
4424414 for now the main uc battle is between cisco and microsoft as measured by customer experiences and ratings
4424415 but ibm and avaya arent far behind so the right focus on customer service value and technology innovation could easily shift this market in the coming year
4424416 striving for a customers trust credibility and satisfaction has been the core philosophy of our group be it gaur green avenue gaur heights gaur ganga gaur homes elegante gaur grandeur or the recently launched gaur gracious at moradabad we leave no stone unturned in giving the best to our buyers
4424417 there is a very thin line that distinguishes the extraordinary from the ordinary that line is determined by honesty integrity and commitment we value our patrons the most and strive hard to maintain the high standards of business that we have set for ourselves and in retrospect become extraordinary
4424418 also if the property is very old or is being developed by a relatively unknown builder the bank might have an issue with providing a home loan
4424419 in such cases you will need to shell out the difference between the actual price and the banks valuation as additional down payment it makes sense to ask the bank to value the property on payment of a small fee especially if it is an old re sale property
4424420 this is a fair indicator of what you can expect as not if and when the interest rates start moving down and the time comes for the bank to pass on the benefit to you

4424439 yo te vi bailar muchas veces y nunca te felicite hoy te felicito porque cuando te vi por primera vez eras una chuequita hoy me convenciste

4424442 te vi muy segura en tu centro estas bien parada
4424443 whatever your fear your best shot to overcome it is to strive at being the best instead of accepting that youre doomed to be the worst
4424444 i do this out of a sense of participating in democracy
4424445 when the opportunity came up to take our electric guitars and make some unholy noise to try to stop a war it sounded familiar to me
4424446 its something we did 40 years ago as part of a generation that said the war in vietnam was wrong and needed to stop were part of a generation saying the war in iraq is wrong and needs to stop
4424447 when they mentioned our names for all the different categories i was most proud of jamie being nominated for male vocalist i really thought he was deserving of that
4424448 hes one of the best bass players weve got in this business and to finally see him get recognition after standing behind for all these years is just wonderful
4424449 its always an honor to get nominated and its always a surprise too
4424450 you know theres a lot of young bands out there that are really entertaining the people these days id rather one of them would win it because theyre great but i still love talking to people on stage and we do requests from the audience all the time i figure they pay to get in to see you so you need to do what they want you to do
4424451 new ideas never get proven when fear is in control
4424452 if i may be so bold there was another president
4424453 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4424454 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4424455 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4424456 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4424457 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4424458 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4424459 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4424460 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4424461 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years
4424462 ma che fai ti metti a lavorare proprio qui davanti a una chiesa

4424465 when the athletic condition tends to drop and belgium will also be a little tired it is the team with more quality who emerges
4424466 the british market is difficult to work in because fees for players are excessive as are wages we are hoping to bring in a couple players in time for saturday we have to add more quality to the squad and we are working hard to do that
4424467 im very excited to be here and it is a dream to play for such a big club in the premier league
4424468 i have known about newcastles interest for a while and i wanted to sign because it is a club i know all about from my time watching english football in spain and argentina

4424517 im so shocked at the moment i cant think i cant reply to you
4424518 gaki san can you give me half an hour to think about this
4424519 gaki san ive never been confessed to by a girl before heck ive never been confessed to by a guy before
4424520 ive thought about dating girls a few times but each time i thought about it i became scared of myself i had no idea if i was wrong for thinking those things so ive been ignoring it
4424521 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry
4424522 you are a very important person to me and i feel like i need to give us a chance
4424523 ill be your girlfriend for one week after that ill give you my answer is that okay

4424537 i want to challenge myself both in matches and in training every day and i want to improve my game that is why i am here as long as the manager keeps me as part of the team that will do for me
4424538 anyone is able to say whatever they want i know that i am clean i did project believe with usada us anti doping agency where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove that
4424539 people can question all they want but the facts are facts and i have the results to prove it
4424540 with a program like i have i have to work on speed and endurance and all four strokes i need the speed to take it out at the start and the endurance to carry it through
4424541 you cant do it on talent alone a lot of hard work a lot of dedication
4424542 obviously i could do with a few more weeks training
4424543 but i am here and i think the fact that im here and im strong very strong actually will be an advantage for me in the race too
4424544 dont wait until the right time in your career to have a child or it will never come
4424545 the information so far is very encouraging the recent days have had very good air conditions indeed
4424546 there is no indication that there will be a problem in the near future
4424547 it was a surprise for me where was all the pollution i have read about in the newspapers
4424548 the olympics has been a real catalyst for environmental improvement in beijing people may be sceptical about it but it is happening
4424549 sei froh da es nicht richtig weh tut du h ttest ja auch mit dem kopf gegen die dusche fallen k nnen

4424552 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4424553 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4424554 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4424555 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4424556 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4424557 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4424558 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this

4424568 we would appeal to the more liberal parts of the community to help us with this and we also need the engagement of the integration representative of the city senate
4424569 this is one of many signs of something that keeps on coming up something needs to be done and we need to work together to try to tackle the problem

4424693 n o acredito nisso principalmente porque os jogos dentro de casa t m sido mais complicados do que fora pois os times v m enfrentar o corinthians com dez jogadores atr s da linha da bola

4424697 a concorr ncia boa acho que o corinthians est no caminho certo com grandes jogadores quem ganha a entidade fico feliz pois vai mostrar que tenho que jogar mais e mais evoluir para ter lugar ao sol
4424698 we gaan normaal gesproken spelen met een diepe spits en drie aanvallende middenvelders die speelwijze sluit denk ik het beste aan bij de kwaliteiten van de spelers
4424699 ik liet feyenoord ook al zo voetballen voor mij is het dus niets nieuws
4424700 ik heb daar niet lang over na hoeven te denken
4424701 ik selecteer namelijk de beste voetballers en mark hoort daar in mijn ogen bij
4424702 mark is groot en sterk en kan goed voetballen hij is denk ik niet voor niets de eerste buitenlandse aanvoerder van bayern m nchen
4424703 hij moet zich nog wel een beetje beter leren beheersen
4424704 sneijder is nu geblesseerd maar rafael van der vaart robin van persie en ibrahim afellay kunnen ook goed achter de spits spelen dat wil niet zeggen dat ik seedorf al heb afgeschreven als het niet loopt met de huidige spelers kom ik misschien wel weer bij hem uit
4424705 ele um jogador que aprovou aqui e n s gostamos muito dele o herrera tem a cara do corinthians e se encaixa perfeitamente naquilo que o corinthians

4424712 yahoo dropped the del icio us ball with a pointless 3 year rewrite
4424713 theres this incredible period when luke is growing up even though we dont ever meet luke in the series of so much powerful stuff going on especially in relation to the empire how its trying to not only extend but also preserve its power base the revels are starting to get themselves together and theres a whole bunch of characters and new worlds that we want to go to and figure out its an open playing field to us right now were really excited about it we want to try and answer all the questions that everybodys had for the last 30 years
4424714 tonally the series is so different from the six movies its so much darker and more dangerious and its more convoluted because it has to do with families in a much more provocative way its a more adult story its not a kids story any more

4424716 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
4424717 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
4424718 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
4424719 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp

4424866 we will keep competing for as long as we can
4424867 i dont think thats true we keep a balance between physical and mental strength
4424868 it has to do with us playing together for a while and understanding the system that we want to play with its a system that colangelo put into place that you see really coming to fruition
4424869 they knew what they needed to do to take us out of our game
4424870 i would tell you that last night that premise was buried once and for all
4424871 the guys played it the way coach mike krzyzewski wanted to play it and look what happened
4424872 we chose the team to fit the type of defense that we felt needed to be played in the international game
4424873 were good with that decision we have to go out and continue to prove it weve been playing very good defense thats been the one constant that and effort

4424880 with this equipment we will have facilities for magnetic resonance imaging of childrens brains that match the best of those in any other hospital or research institute in the world

4424911 im pretty sure there will be games where i have to come up with a big shot or something like that
4424912 right now my scoring hasnt even been a factor in what weve been doing weve still been winning by 20 and 30 points
4424913 one summer kobe bryant wasnt here the next summer dwyane wade wasnt there so his numbers arent going to be there
4424914 his touches are less so i wouldnt put a whole lot into the number aspect
4424915 reboundings been big for him hes getting in there and hes making things happen
4424916 defensively the last couple of games hes really been coming on and the four position is a very important position on this team and i think he understands that
4424917 and the one thing i like about him hes been the leading scorer the last two times weve played together and hes still not pressing about being the leading scorer he wants the gold medal and hes made that very clear and hell do whatever it takes to get one so hes doing all the dirty work hes doing all the things you need to do
4424918 i think thursday night was by far the best that hes been and thats what we need from him he was pretty active defensively rebounding and really did a good job
4424919 hes been working hard and i think thursday night was a little payoff for him
4424920 long as i know somebody else is putting the ball in the basket just as well as i do im all right with that
4424921 i think on this team this year we need that just as much as we need my scoring and my teammates they know that i can score thats not an issue
4424922 hes probably as good a scorer as there is as far as big guys go because he gets to the line
4424923 he gets to the basket and he can still shoot the 3 and he can shoot the in between

4424939 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4424940 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4424941 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4424942 im pretty sure there will be games where i have to come up with a big shot or something like that

4424956 its just too bad that we couldnt pull through on what is indias independence day today
4424957 i could not interpret that other than a deliberate intake
4424958 it is regretful for ngan thuong because she is an athlete trained in china since her childhood and she has seized many achievements for vietnams gymnastics
4424959 we do not know why thuong has such a thought to have a slimmer body so she made that mistake
4424960 my interpretation is that it is a problem resulting from poor information of the athlete not enough knowledge what to take
4424961 i want to dedicate this gold medal to my motherland and to my mother who passed away not long ago
4424962 there is sort of a repertoire that i will once a year i will have to watch each one of them ill say that ferris buellers day off i can watch that movie anytime its pretty much the prefect comedy and its kind of an amazing movie plot wise because it doesnt follow the sort of usual quintessential joseph campbell story its not about a guy that learns anything over a journey and becomes a different person ferris is the same son of a bitch the whole movie he just effects change wherever he is and really the stakes are really never all that high and hes happy the whole time and the fact that they pulled that off and it is as funny as it is and as cool as it is it just amazing
4424963 a japanese film called battle royale is one of my favorites and thats like a john hughes movie on crystal meth like to me battle royale there is not greater meditation on teen x than that movie that is the greatest coming of age movie ive ever seen
4424964 i quite like a movie called the wrong guy with dave foley its a little canadian movie that not many people have seen but its just possibly one of the funniest movies ever made
4424965 another movie that i really really love that i constantly get into arguments about it irreversible thats probably my favorite film of all time to me thats like the single greatest work of cinema that ive ever seen and another thing is that in an era such as this where everything is made by committee its very rare to see one artist unfiltered vision and gaspar no wrote directed produced and literally operated the camera on irreversible so this is his movie you know
4424966 and then carlitos way man hunter jfk thats the playlist i watch each of those movies once a year
4424967 we are seeing a shift in hong kongs peoples mindset where they are less confident than they have been about the state of their personal finances and are therefore likely to be more stringent in their discretionary spending choices in the next 12 months
4424968 the inflation issue has become an unwelcome household term since last year and consumers wages and pay packets have been stretched to the limits
4424969 if you have anything grown raised shot or stolen that fits our menu bring it in and well do you a deal
4424970 the worse people are affected by the financial crisis the more they love our barter arrangement
4424971 since the beginning of this crisis we have been living in a boom
4424972 we are mostly offered goods that people have produced themselves so its much fresher and tastier than what you can get at the supermarket
4424973 because of this measure we are more often in the pub now than at home
4424974 i have committed a serious mistake and i dont fancy for forgiveness from the public but i absolutely take responsibility for my own behaviour
4424975 with the loss of channels will there be a reduction in costs

4424981 we oversee resellers quality and standards and conforming to those standards gives them credibility
4424982 we support the association in its endeavours to make sure these standards are offered across the apple reseller channel
4424983 we now have a number of big hitters and it shows acceptance by the apple channel
4424984 apple does not have ownership of us but i can communicate things to it i know enough senior people to hopefully resolve issues
4424985 political correctness is a doctrine fostered by a when i was young we stole pink flamingoes out of someones yard and then wherever my friends and i went that summer we sent postcards from the flamingoes
4424986 we have been here before twice in fact but this season is one filled with more optimism in many ways
4424987 looking at it from the outside i suppose survival is the main thing but inside the club there is a real sense of optimism
4424988 he has used villarreal and az alkmaar as potential models of what he would like to install at the hawthorns he sees those two clubs from spain and holland as mould breakers who challenged the big teams in their leagues and did well out of it he wants that at albion and the challenge is there for him i suspect the fans would be happy to survive this season and then build on that the following year but the manager and the chairman have far loftier ambitions
4424989 the transfer dealings have been quite interesting in the fact that the four players brought in so far are not of the attacking nature that albions football might suggest there is a goalkeeper who was rated at 8 million last year but was signed for under 4 million a left back marek cech from porto who is good technically he was signed for around 1 million simply because he was in the last year of his deal gianni zuiverloon from heerenveen he wont play on saturday as he is at the olympics has come in and has pace technical ability and likes to get forward also abdoulaye meite has come into the centre from bolton so they have strengthened and are looking for more players especially in midfield the team needs one body in the holding role and then one to replace zoltan gera further up field if they get the players they want they could have a different team by the first of september
4424990 jonathon greening might be a very unspectacular player but he has really grown in the last year he was given much more responsibility as captain and completely transformed himself not into a midfield general but into a player who can dictate play from midfield he orchestrated a lot of goals from there and one game last season saw neil warnock claim that you needed two players to man mark greening he had that effect on the team last season
4424991 the team are better prepared than they were before in the fact they have players that have played in the premier league people like james morrison ishmael miller jonathan greening paul robinson so they do have a nucleus in the team and they are trying to bring more in as we speak the albion team that we eventually see after the transfer window closes will probably be different to the one we see at emirates on saturday
4424992 if i tell you that west brom conceded more goals last season than relegated leicester then that gives its own indications about where they need strengthening in my opinion i feel the spine of the team is a bit weak they are perhaps a body short of doing the dirty part of midfield work the ball winning side of things then of course there is a huge void left by kevin phillips replacing a player that scores 25 goals albeit at a lower level takes some doing having said all that they are getting there
4424993 mowbray has gone with five in midfield pretty much all of pre season and albion i would say were at their best playing that last season
4424994 made with a sprinkle of salt and a taste of butter
4424995 the whole of ethiopia wanted him to run the marathon but he is 35 and wants to compete again in four years in london at the olympics haile believes he can ran fast there at age 39
4424996 even athletes in top form can be wrecked by this
4424997 i still have two big goals to win another olympic gold and to run in a marathon below 2 04 hours
4424998 women and children were murdered churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed

4425001 theres still room for copper price to fall another 10 per cent or so part of that is a function of chinas growth slowing
4425002 we are very close to cost of production and chinese net imports should be recovering and increasing taking prices higher again we are pretty positive on aluminum
4425003 chilean production the worlds top producer has been impacted by grades decline strikes and weather shortages of acid power and water will pressure operations in 2009
4425004 zinc prices will turn next year with the chinese taking much stronger action to curb production growth and trying to restrict exports

4425008 shes chicken she was on the cellphone and crying badly i couldnt understand a word she said
4425009 i thought if i kept my sanity i would help her i was trying to be a team player

4425011 i told her every time you think it is impossible this is to remind you it is possible
4425012 you dont have to be inhuman to win a gold medal
4425013 i lose by one tenth of a point to vladimir but she fix that
4425014 he was so close to winning that all around gold medal
4425015 just standing there on that podium thinking about that i hoped i made up for that i hoped he feels just as proud as i am of it
4425016 there is nothing to wait nothing to be afraid of
4425017 shes a smart girl i hope she listens to me half the time
4425018 all i can remember is going up i went up and i came down and i hit something very very hard
4425019 a soldier told me i hit the footpath but as far as i was concerned i thought i hit a telegraph pole cause all i could see was sparks and the smell of rubber
4425020 i looked down and i could see annes skirt and i thought oh poor annes been injured too
4425021 i thought wheres the rest of the girls and they werent i couldnt see anybody
4425022 i think the intelligence services have not fully cooperated with the investigation
4425023 my father said and i do believe his words theres a time for you to be born into this world and a time for you to be taken out of it
4425024 thats quite true cause its been proved cause all those people round me were all taken and i was saved but in saying that it was a hard fight a very hard fight

4425041 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw said marc garlasco senior military analyst at human rights watch in a statement
4425042 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4425043 this is the first known use of cluster munitions since 2006 during israels war with hezbollah in lebanon said the rights group
4425044 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
4425045 it has been a privilege to work on this project very few people would have the chance to do something like this
4425046 we have all really enjoyed the project it has been a fantastic experience for the four of us
4425047 our highlight was working with the children they really light up the day their enthusiasm to learn pushed us
4425048 everyone gets porridge and bread for some children this will be the only meal they have for 24 hours
4425049 these kids had nothing before meg started raising money in the yard they had a tyre and a stick
4425050 the thing that struck us was that poverty does not mean squalor
4425051 the people have very very little but what they do have they make the best of
4425052 they make sure the children are presentable and they rushed around and tidied up their houses before we went in they have pride i was very humbled by it
4425053 at times it was very emotional but feeling sorry for the people does not help giving them a leg up does
4425054 i think these four are absolutely magnificent i think they have been totally selfless dedicated committed and absolutely determined to raise this 20 000 and i know they are leaving but i know they will carry on
4425055 its just something ive always been interested in i was going to do it on civvy street if i hadnt joined the army ive always been a bit of a tomboy
4425056 its going to be hard work but im really looking forward to it
4425057 there is only me going to bordon from the females in my platoon
4425058 i was in the cadets for four and a half years and my mum and dad were in the army because of my time in the cadets i aspired to join the army
4425059 the army is a good career its stable good money and you always have someone to turn to
4425060 its absolutely great they only send in the best instructors in the army to teach at the college
4425061 she has worked very hard its hard work at 16

4425064 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4425065 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4425066 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4425067 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4425068 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4425069 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4425070 often don revealing blouses and always have makeup jobs fresh out of a beauty salon
4425071 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4425072 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4425073 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4425074 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4425075 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this

4425083 we are not condemning anybody here but we are against the bill not against congressmen as a person we are all brothers and sisters
4425084 we respect our beloved congressmen and congresswomen because they are also catholics they also have a good objective
4425085 what we want to hear from our beloved president is the total rejection of the reproductive health bill and should make a definite statement about it

4425108 hovercraft were fashionable in the late 1960s and early 70s but they lost market when high speed alternatives such the catamaran ferries were developed
4425109 increasing awareness of the need to minimise environmental impact has led to their resurgence and we have been able to demonstrate our expertise in engineered fabrics to meet demand for skirts for the new craft in production
4425110 we found our niche in the everyday person who didnt want to spend a fortune to have fun on the water

4425141 it is possible that a licensing regime could help mitigate the impact of harmful interference to incumbents in this spectrum
4425142 i urge the commission to carefully and deliberately weigh each proposal prior to reaching any tentative or preliminary conclusions

4425144 we are extremely pleased with the collective results from the fcc field testing phase over these past few weeks

4425150 you can argue whether 65 is the number or 55 is the number

4425256 the block copolymer lattice is sort of fooled by these pillars and forms its array around them they form a nice ordered pattern around the pillars
4425257 by properly choosing the spatial distribution of the pillars to match a desired final structure it was possible to consistently generate defect free polymer nanostructures

4425271 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4425272 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4425273 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there

4425275 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4425276 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4425277 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4425278 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4425279 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4425314 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important

4425371 youre working on an electrical system without tagging it out when along comes seaman schmuckatelli who energizes the circuit and zap youre fried calamari
4425372 im going to secure your mouth if you dont shut the hell up
4425373 were going to have great liberty this port a tuna boat just pulled in
4425374 damn we just did a six month westpac barely got home for a week and now were heading out again
4425375 in 18 years of taking part in debates i have never seen an incident like this one
4425376 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4425377 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4425378 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4425379 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4425380 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4425381 in heaven there may be some evidence down in the lolo forest because thats where we were
4425382 hes killed way a lot more people that you dont even know about
4425383 he was going to change his mind because he said i taught him how to love
4425384 dear dad i have very good news and it is we are coming home soon it might be a week or 2 so we will be back

4425387 the generous donation of mrs d cooper is much appreciated human bodies used for teaching are obtained entirely through donations this gift has contributed significantly to the advancement of health science education programs in our state teaching and research programs at the iu schools of medicine and dentistry rely on these generous body donations to teach physicians dentists physical therapists nurses and other allied health professionals those who decide to bequeath their bodies to the health sciences have made a significant contribution that benefits the quality of life and care for the living
4425388 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4425389 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4425390 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4425391 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4425392 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4425393 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4425394 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this

4425424 die harzcard ist ein klares zeichen f r einen starken gemeinsamen auftritt der region ber landesgrenzen hinweg und zeigt was m glich ist wenn man gemeinsam an einem strang zieht
4425425 wir erwarten von dem neuen angebot insgesamt wichtige impulse zur weiteren touristischen entwicklung der gesamten harz region im wettbewerb mit den anderen innerdeutschen feriengebieten k nnen wir nur gemeinsam punkten mit der harzcard machen wir unseren g sten ein wirklich interessantes und lohnendes angebot

4425429 im feeling a bit sad today i miss granny granpa
4425430 you look a bit sad today lets do something nice to cheer us up
4425431 i feel a bit indifferent i know ive done well with the hard bit im pleased with my as
4425432 im thrilled id like to thank all my teachers and my mum and dad for their help and support
4425433 the very able students have done well and won their places at top universities but there are some significant success stories from those who have had to work to achieve pass grades
4425434 there has been research to show if parents are involved with childrens learning children do better
4425435 parental involvement in childrens learning is vital and the framework really supports this
4425436 it brings these frameworks together to make a more coherent nought to five framework its what early years educators have been striving for for a long time it follows a pattern used in new zealand called te wharike weaving together frameworks
4425437 all the areas are of equal importance but personal social and emotional development is the key one if you dont have personal social and emotional development in place then the other learning cant happen effectively
4425438 it hopes children reach the goals by the end of reception but some children wont so there needs to be a sensitive using of the framework
4425439 but looking at these figures it looks like theres been a marked improvement in year nine pupils performance so that now theyre significantly out achieving national averages
4425440 school children in this county are getting a better and better foundation in the core subjects that set them up for the future but we are not complacent we are setting challenging targets for the future and have in place a major programme of change in secondary education which will revolutionise performance in some of our weaker schools
4425441 the tale so far is one of significant improvement across the board for both girls and boys
4425442 when he settles in when there are runners on base he executes pitches
4425443 he gets comfortable gets in his delivery and gets in the flow of the game and really pitches well
4425444 we got all those runs near the beginning of the game so i should have been able to go out there and get outs at a better pace but i wasnt able to
4425445 i felt like i was struggling to get into a good groove all game
4425446 of course youre embarrassed were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that
4425447 our bullpen definitely didnt need to be in there for nine innings i wish i would have done better
4425448 primero nos enfrentamos a los holandeses con todas sus estrellas luego a los astutos japoneses y por ltimo a los estadounidenses que son fuertes f sicamente y mejores de lo que la mayor a de la gente piensa
4425449 estamos haciendo correr el bal n sobre el c sped un toque dos toques no queremos mandarlo arriba y tener que correr tras l para m eso no es f tbol
4425450 el entendimiento entre victor obinna peter odemwingie y yo y con los dem s muchachos del equipo est creciendo con cada partido nos estamos haciendo m s fuertes y estamos mejorando nuestro f tbol
4425451 estamos poniendo lo mejor que tenemos para llegar lo m s lejos posible
4425452 no podemos empezar a hablar de medallas a estas alturas porque cualquiera de los equipos que han quedado en este torneo puede hacernos da o
4425453 una medalla ser a suficiente para dejar satisfecha a la afici n china
4425454 nuestros rivales son m s fuertes que nosotros tanto f sica como t cnicamente y este resultado refleja la disparidad en los puntos fuertes de ambos equipos
4425455 las selecciones asi ticas suelen quedarse cortas en las competiciones internacionales sobre todo cuando nos medimos a africanos y europeos
4425456 los jugadores asi ticos son r pidos y flexibles pero esas ventajas no contrarrestan la fortaleza f sica de nuestros oponentes
4425457 hemos adolecido de falta de experiencia en el rea y hemos desperdiciado demasiadas ocasiones claras
4425458 hemos demostrado que ofensivamente somos un equipo decente pero nuestros jugadores j venes necesitan pulir su remate
4425459 estamos teniendo problemas para ver puerta con este equipo en general es un problema que afecta a las selecciones australianas de todas las categor as
4425460 italia es un equipo muy fuerte y de clase mundial nosotros estamos ante una oportunidad hist rica para el f tbol belga y seguro que tiene un gusto extra cuando se busca ante un rival de semejante peso ojal continuemos en el torneo escribiendo esta bella historia
4425461 no podemos subestimar a holanda un equipo que cuenta con grandes individualidades y juega gran f tbol nosotros somos argentina y aspiramos al oro pero respetando a todos los rivales que se crucen en nuestro camino esa es la f rmula
4425462 es bueno que haya tres equipos africanos en cuartos de final quiere decir que todos tenemos poder o para pelear por cosas importantes nigeria ya sabe lo que es ser campe n pero nosotros tenemos equipo para estar en la final conf o mucho en nuestro equipo
4425463 la historia quiere que nos volvamos a encontrar con camer n un equipo de muy fuerte y de mucho cuidado l gicamente queremos hacer las cosas bien y pasar de fase venimos haciendo bien las cosas
4425464 este es uno de los clubes m s grandes del mundo y las expectativas son enormes
4425465 yo hablo el idioma del f tbol que es universal
4425466 l quiere que el chelsea practique un buen f tbol y eso es lo que pretendo
4425467 quiero que el chelsea sea amado en todo el mundo como el barcelona y el manchester united
4425468 creo que podemos ganar t tulos desplegando un f tbol bonito
4425469 este a o tenemos cuatro competiciones y voy a intentar ganarlas todas
4425470 el chelsea se ha arriesgado conmigo aunque yo conf o en mis posibilidades la presi n no me da miedo

4425479 it was sweet revenge because i lost to them with yves allegro four years ago in athens
4425480 we expected them to be tougher but in a best out of three set doubles match anything can happen
4425481 i think we need to be focused and play like we did today
4425482 three or four years ago there was a film in cannes on the great soccer player zidane
4425483 it was about one game when he was playing with real madrid what was amazing in the film was that 20 cameras were on zidane during the whole match i was amazed by it i said this is great
4425484 allowed us to bring cameras which he never ever does
4425485 he jackson allowed us to shoot in the locker room for the game at half time and after the game its just a total look at one of the worlds greatest athletes and the preparation that he does
4425486 it has really turned into this amazing documentary of one of the worlds greatest basketball players

4425527 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4425528 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4425529 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4425530 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4425531 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4425536 all that i have is yours or will be yours through me you obtained your life it is my will which determines your future and hence determines your fate
4425537 although my position demands that i be obedient to the laws i cannot believe that my fate must always be determined by your opinions
4425538 this girl lies in prison not by her own will but by mine this proves sufficiently for any logical mind that it is my will not hers which is determining her fate
4425539 she must have done or said something very wrong for a monarch with whom we find no fault to treat his own flesh and blood so
4425540 will only annoy me further and seem to weaken my rights if you stay within my realms i could kill you but i am merciful i therefore banish you into the wilderness adjoining my territory this is a wilderness inhabited only by wild beasts and such eccentric outcasts who cannot survive in our rational society there you will soon discover whether you can have an existence apart from that of your family and if you can whether you prefer it to ours
4425541 is a life whose elements belong together form a completeness yet neither individually nor collectively do they obey the commands of my father the king

4425562 the doctor strongly suggested that if i wanted to heal properly i needed to quit
4425563 when you start talking about your face it becomes motivating
4425564 when someone hears this from an internist or cardiologist who says its really bad for you it increases your risk of lung cancer its bad for your heart people tend to blow that off if theyre feeling well
4425565 but if they have a medical problem and are not going for just a routine checkup they may tend to listen to that advice more
4425566 with plastic surgery its a little bit different people are desirous of an elective procedure and thats their main objective in coming in its something they truly want
4425567 nicotine causes the tiny blood vessels in the skin to clamp down or constrict which reduces blood supply to the skin
4425568 twenty five years ago it may have been more acceptable for a patient to have undergone surgical procedures while smoking
4425569 nowadays if a doctor knew a patient was smoking and they did flap surgery
4425570 why invest so much money in a cosmetic procedure for enhancement if the patient will not participate and do his or her part to help ensure the best outcome possible
4425571 you can talk to people about quitting smoking but you may not have a months worth of time before you try to save their life with heart surgery
4425572 with the advent of things like chantix we have a much higher success rate
4425573 i want it to look great for you as well as for myself if they smoke even one cigarette i run the risk of it not healing its like trying to water your lawn with a crimped hose
4425574 this is not a prime driver of quitting in america
4425575 these are all adults and im not going to be the person looking over their shoulders
4425576 this was like the first major surgery id had as an adult
4425577 so when my doctor who i respect tells me not to smoke and here are some reasons why then i have to respect that
4425578 they see the wound opening up turning red or black the edges start coming apart

4425636 i do not want to comment on that how long he will be on leave or when he is due back
4425637 i started to run automatically to get a life ring and then me and another man pulled him out and put him in the recovery position
4425638 i started to run towards him but he was too far away to throw the life ring so i had to jump over the gate and run up the length of the jetty to get to him
4425639 another guy was running towards him but the man was under the jetty at this point and i couldnt see him
4425640 hed got him halfway and between us we managed to pull him out and put him into the recovery position
4425641 he was freezing cold and couldnt speak when we pulled him out but im just glad he was okay
4425642 it didnt look as if he could have held on for much longer
4425643 and when i got back to it i had a message on my phone from my mother
4425644 she was watching it from her balcony and rang to say that everything was alright because someone was running down the jetty towards the man in the water
4425645 the problem is that the volume of tenants has risen by 25 but the volume of property available for rent has risen by 35 there is a lot of stock coming in from people who cant sell and who are putting it on the rental market instead there is a lot of choice out there for tenants
4425646 across the uk we are seeing a lot of people choosing to rent rather than buy and our offices are very busy but there has also been a surge in stock and i would say in some areas rental prices have fallen by 10 in docklands in particular we are seeing an oversupply developers have decided not to sell and are putting properties through the lettings market
4425647 recent buy to let investors may find themselves facing a 90 capital loss if they borrowed 90 of their property value
4425648 property investors may be forced to sell up prematurely because interest payments become unaffordable the real test of affordability is to come in 2009 10 when those who borrowed large sums at relatively cheap rates in 2007 come off two and three year fixed deals

4425673 lo novedoso es el emulsificante y la forma de hacer el producto esto es lo que podr amos patentar en uruguay
4425674 el compuesto se produce ofreci ndole al microorganismo un ambiente que tenga los nutrientes necesarios para que se desarrolle de d nde sacamos los nutrientes de desechos lo cual tiene cero costo

4425706 the plans for abu dhabi are truly remarkable the transport infrastructure is also already sound and the states pockets are bottomless
4425707 abu dhabi plans to be a premier global tourism destination within the next three years the emirate will see major investment in airport infrastructure which will increase airport capacity from seven million to 20 million passengers a year by 2011
4425708 from an investors point of view abu dhabi has several serious advantages with a 200 billion investment programme scheduled for the next 10 years its little wonder that there is such excitement around this market
4425709 the only way to combat this inflationary problems is to lose the peg and allow the aed to float freely

4425713 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
4425714 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4425715 its very hard in the beginning to understand that the whole idea is not to beat the other runners eventually you learn that the competition is against the little voice inside you that wants you to quit
4425716 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go and do that because what the world needs is people who have come alive
4425717 always concentrate on how far you have come rather than how far you have left to go the difference in how easy it seems will amaze you
4425718 phelps swam into history as the winningest olympic athlete ever with his 10th and 11th career gold medals and five world records in five events at the beijing games
4425719 no wonder his competitors realize theyre merely swimming for second
4425720 the objective is for us to progress we have the quality to compete in this league
4425721 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the title
4425722 i cant wait for the season to start it is going to be an exciting one and we will be up for it
4425723 i think every manager wants another couple of players and im no different we are continuing to work hard to bring players in that will help the areas of the pitch that need some assistance at the moment
4425724 potentially one or two players are going to play out of position at the weekend in an ideal world wed have had a few more bodies in but lets wait and see
4425725 then why all the rush to interpolated 120hz 100hz pal for home movie display
4425726 live big screen video using hand held cameras would be inadequate at 48p
4425727 is that why they all walk out on 60 hz hdtv oh wait they dont
4425728 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
4425729 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
4425730 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day
4425731 flicker is noticed more with computer displays due to the white sheet of paper model flat white areas appear to flicker more than dark
4425732 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face

4425781 we carefully evaluated oxford biomedicas present situation from a management scientific and equity prospective based on our analysis we decided to resubmit our previous rejected offer at a higher price per share we strongly believe that genethera may indeed be in the position by acquiring oxford biomedica to bring substantial value both to the companys scientific platform and to its shareholders
4425782 genetheras dna vaccine technology purivax is a highly efficient system designed to greatly improve dna vaccines application in clinic trials oxford biomedicas renal cancer clinical trial trovax was recently halted because of its failure to improve survival rate in the patients enrolled in the trial we believe that our purivax technology would be a critical factor in getting the trovax clinical trial restarted and possibly successfully completed i would like to also point out that the merging of the two companies would create a major player in the field of dna cancer vaccines the new company will also be in the position to meet the requirements for a listing on the amex or nasdaq giving genethera and oxford biomedica shareholders a greater advantage when compared to the present situation
4425783 we are pleased to have received such a rapid review from the fda and look forward to addressing their comments promptly

4425786 the second quarter of 2008 was a productive one for dor biopharma
4425787 we have now established named patient access programs for orbec in europe australia new zealand south korea singapore malaysia and south africa with more countries anticipated we have begun to receive orders for orbec treatments pursuant to these programs that will begin to generate revenue for us in the third quarter of 2008 we are also in the process of working with the fda on the protocol design for the upcoming confirmatory phase 3 clinical trial of orbec for the treatment of gi gvhd we believe that we will be able to initiate this trial during the fourth quarter of 2008 however additional funds will be required to fully execute this clinical program and others not presently covered by existing grants we continue to manage our cash burn very carefully while evaluating all strategic alternatives including potential orbec licensing deals and m amp a alternatives

4425798 we have told the court we will announce within 45 days the new location of migron
4425799 the government caved in to settlers who threatened to use violence if they are evacuated while they illegally occupy private palestinian land
4425800 the thought of evacuating migron is against the torah and basic human morals
4425801 migron was erected in a fraudulent manner on private land taken from palestinians the same settlers who violated the law are now seeing their actions sanctioned by the law
4425802 the presidents decrees on the black sea fleet will of course be implemented on the territory of ukraine
4425803 the defense ministry and the general staff are among those state bodies responsible for this task

4425807 the icc taskforce needs to report back to the icc they need to take on the advice that theyre picking up not only from feedback theyre getting from australia but also from new zealand and england and south africa and other parts of the world
4425808 to some extent the ball is in their court but at the same time were obviously very interested in taking on advice from all the various sources right now
4425809 were very short of time now if were going to relocate that decision needs to be made in the next few days so time is of the essence
4425810 the whole basis of the champions trophy is its the best eight teams the best players so not only would it be very disappointing if we had lesser teams taking the place of our major teams
4425811 but even if those teams went and were understrength it would also be a disappointment to us
4425812 thats been probably the hardest thing to tell you the truth
4425813 were only three weeks away from one of the biggest one day tournaments that we play and yet we still dont know if were going but well deal with that in a professional manner

4425892 arguably iraq can only be held together by a monster

4425910 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4425911 every day shelter is seeing more and more ordinary hardworking people who are terrified of losing their homes
4425912 they are being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4425913 there are a range of options your lender can consider to help reduce or reschedule your payments for a period of time while you get back on your feet
4425914 while we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4425915 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4425916 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4425917 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4425918 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4425919 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4425920 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4425921 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4425922 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4425923 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4425924 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4425925 only a few people are still with him and he only wants two things indemnity for the sins and crimes he committed in the past eight years and a piece of land so he can live rest of his life there

4425931 i think this case presents some new questions and some hard questions
4425932 something that may exhibit whole behaviours but still remains closely tied to the activity of individual neurons

4425934 of course they will people in singapore like to follow one another but its up to participants whether they are interested to deal with other parties
4425935 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4425936 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4425937 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4425938 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation

4425944 im going now to talk to georgian president saakashvili about the clarifications that the french have provided
4425945 and then well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap
4425946 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4425947 of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4425948 we are still in the negotiating process russians are trying to justify their invasion and to legalise their presence in georgia
4425949 i think we should take a closer look at it the peace agreement
4425950 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4425951 we have set up scores of watch towers and have cameras placed in open areas crossroads and major entrances
4425952 theyre not coming back because the people of basra will not have them back
4425953 the basrawis realized what a nightmare literally that was theyre not going to put themselves back through that period of violent extremism theyve got better things now to do with their lives and i do not see basra coming back under militia control those days are past
4425954 some will continue to try and attack us and the iraqi security forces because between us we have frustrated their designs
4425955 and there are violent extremists around who for whatever their perverted motives will try and slow down iraqs irreversible recovery but they wont succeed because with the iraqi security forces we are building a counterterrorist structure in basra that will be proof against them
4425956 as security improves as iraqi security force improve theres going to be scope obviously for the government to review those numbers
4425957 i think there will be a fundamental mission change and the troop numbers will be tailored to what that mission is
4425958 its not really helpful to speculate at the moment but as security improves and as the iraqi security forces improve their capabilities as they are doing daily then obviously there is scope for numbers to be reviewed
4425959 we have reached important agreements on natural gas and electricity issues god willing we will complete them as soon as possible
4425960 as you know issues like natural gas and petroleum need investment and talks on these issues may take a long time

4425967 sono stanco ieri faceva caldo ma va molto meglio rispetto allanno scorso
4425968 stiamo facendo una buona preparazione ci saranno altre due amichevoli e credo che per la prima giornata con linter sar pronto
4425969 sono rimasto qui perch ho trovato quello che in dieci anni non avevo mai trovato qui mi vogliono tutti bene e questa la cosa pi importante per me le sirene di mercato non le sento perch alla fine conta solo la volont del giocatore e io voglio restare qui per molto tempo
4425970 oggi non si pu dire qui mancini ha fatto tanto magari fra 6 7 anni potrei avvicinarmi a quello che ha fatto lui
4425971 un peccato che sia stato mandato via in tre anni ha vinto molti trofei e allinter non accadeva da anni stato massacrato dalla stampa e in societ non stato tutelato da parecchi
4425972 nei prossimi tre quattro anni far vincere tutto ha due coglioni come una casa se dice che vincer dovete credergli
4425973 ha un grande gruppo ma non credo possa vincere la champions se dovesse arrivare ai quarti o agli ottavi avrebbe gi fatto molto una vittoria finale assomiglierebbe a un miracolo
4425974 questa squadra mi piace possiamo lottare per la coppa uefa e il mio sogno che tra 2 3 anni possiamo lottare per la champions se dovessi arrivarci per me sarebbe come vincere un mondiale
4425975 lippi sa quello che posso dare ha sempre avuto buone parole per me non ho dovuto dimostrare nulla nellamichevole di carrara conosce bene le mie capacit
4425976 un grande uomo e un grande allenatore sono certo che far tanta strada perch coerente ha pagato anche per altri
4425977 ma figuriamoci scherza il giocatore direi a tutti di andare in avanti e prenderemmo dieci gol

4425982 we can confirm that a decision has been taken by the dispute resolution chamber drc regarding the case of the player adrian mutu and chelsea football club england and that the decision has been notified to the parties concerned
4425983 the claim for compensation of chelsea football club regarding the breach of a contract which was signed between the two parties on 12 august 2003 has been partially accepted the player adrian mutu will have to pay the amount of eur 17 173 990 to chelsea football club according to art 63 of the fifa statutes this decision may be appealed against before the court of arbitration for sport cas
4425984 how many democrats are there in uniform more than you think
4425985 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4425986 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4425987 one possibly mundane explanation for the tilt in contributions from deployed soldiers is that the obama campaign has just been so much savvier with web based donors it may be a logistical question
4425988 it took some effort to get that check i had my mom send me my checkbook and i walked to the post office in camp liberty in baghdad with an envelope addressed to barack obama in chicago illinois
4425989 he was right on iraq long when others were jumping into the sea like lemmings and thats hard to do were soldiers and we respect courage
4425990 most of my friends are conservative republicans and they say im voting for barack mccain does not have a lock on the military vote thats for sure
4425991 well complete our duty im deploying next year because its a commitment i made to the nation not to a president but we all know that iraq was a big mistake
4425992 today there is no set model or path and guys are creating their own measures for success
4425993 guys are still deciphering what it means to be a man
4425994 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4425995 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life

4426133 i have studied only up to the 2nd standard when the election dates were announced i was so shy that i did not talk to any men at that time but when i was elected to the panchayat this became a necessity i underwent training from the taluk panchayat and the singamma sreenivasan foundation i will make sure that there is no violence against women in our village and importance is given to girls education eradication of the dowry problem i want to make our village surroundings clean with greenery all around
4426134 i have been able to get seeds and fertilisers at subsidized rates to poor farmers ensuring proper drainage and water facilities construction of farm ponds and check dams for rain water harvesting prior to my entry into politics the situation in the village was not stable as the gram sabhas and gram panchayat meetings were not being conducted properly the social justice committee was not in existence and women did not even go to panchayats
4426135 since my native place is kogaali it was not difficult for me in the election time for campaigning i went to all houses and campaigned for my vote i had not collected any funds from others for the election in the beginning i was not going out of the house and i used to do house work and agriculture work when i got elected things changed automatically and i used to go out interact with people

4426155 i think that ronald reagan changed the trajectoryof america in a way that you know richard nixon did not in a way that bill clinton did not he put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it i think they felt like you know with all the excesses of the 60s and 70s and you know government had grown and grown but there wasnt much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating and i think that people just tapped in he tapped into what people were already feeling which is we want clarity we want optimism we want you know a return to that sense of dynamism and uh you know entrepreneurship
4426156 the truth is that too much torment and too much depression can make it as difficult to write as to make the bed wash the dishes do the laundry to the depressed person writing may present itself as one more chore for this reason we are actually working on our writing when we directly address the larger issue of our happiness
4426157 i have received a number of complaints from residents in several areas of our district regarding young people playing games such as football cricket and tennis in the street
4426158 we are not intending to spoil anyones fun however if children must play any type of ball game in the street it must be in an acceptable manner
4426159 some residents have complained about noise nuisance of trespassing on property to retrieve the ball and causing disturbance to residents
4426160 under section 161 of the highways act 1980 if a person plays football or any other game on a highway to the annoyance of a user of the highway he is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine
4426161 obviously during the better weather and the summer months children want to play outside however we would recommend they use a nearby playing field where nuisance and damage to property can be kept to a minimum
4426162 causing danger or annoyance to a user of the highway

4426178 we are looking at maintaining a 22 percent growth in sales while for the bottom line we are looking at similar growth
4426179 based on the six months figures we are confident we can achieve that
4426180 the danger we see ahead is inflation increased costs of manufacturing and production and we are not sure we can pass all our costs to the customer therefore our margins will temporarily go down
4426181 but over a period of time as things stabilise we should be able to recover
4426182 the economy generally is still growing the regional economy is still strong as long as the government keeps looking at the infrastructure needs of the country demand for cement is going to keep on growing
4426183 the vast majority of farmers in this country are not able to obtain fertilisers in a timely manner due to import restrictions and international prices

4426187 we were rubbish no midfield and a carthorse up front and the return of the hoof
4426188 lets hope we can get back on track at rushden theres no reason why we cant get at least a draw if we play like we did against stevenage in the 2nd half which would be a good result
4426189 es hat nur sehr wenig gefehlt und ich h tte auf der pole gestanden
4426190 das qualifying war nicht einfach neues team neuer motor einfach eine komplett neue erfahrung deswegen freue ich mich riesig ber die pole position das hat mit gezeigt dass ich die richtige entscheidung getroffen habe ich sitze in einem wettbewerbsf higen auto und ich wei dass wir uns noch verbessern k nnen
4426191 das war ein spezielles qualifying uns fehlte einfach das freie training die yokohama reifen arbeiten in den ersten vier runden besonders gut da muss man gleich voll angreifen das hat im ersten stint auch gut funktioniert doch ich h tte in der einen oder anderen kurve noch etwas mehr pushen m ssen
4426192 ich bin sehr zufrieden mit meinem dritten startplatz jetzt sind wir zur ck in den top positionen ich bin sehr gl cklich ber das setup meines autos leider bin ich auf meiner schnellsten runde in den verkehr geraten zudem war die strecke durch die vielen ausritte ziemlich schmutzig dennoch bin ich sehr zuversichtlich f r den rest des wochenendes
4426193 ich bin so pleite ich w rde momentan f r geld echt alles machen
4426194 boah sara war wieder schlimm heute wie die sich immer aufspielt dass die sich das berhaupt traut mit dieser fiesen neuen frisur

4426199 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4426200 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4426201 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4426202 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4426203 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4426204 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4426205 there are lots of reasons why something like your old computer shouldnt go out with the trash first it may not be trash at all sure if its pre 1995 its not going to do anyone much good but if you bought it in the last 10 years or so it can possibly be upgraded or refurbished and be of great use to someone who doesnt have the money to buy a new one and if you do have a relic on your hands tossing it is still not the best way to go if you throw out your old electronics not only are you taking up increasingly scarce landfill space with valuable resources like plastic metal and glass that could be made into new devices using less energy than it takes with virgin resources but youre also putting potentially toxic materials in the ground lead mercury and other substances can leech from old monitors and circuit boards into the air and ground water and possibly affect peoples health in some countries and many u s states particular electronic components are regulated as hazardous waste

4426208 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4426209 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4426210 often don revealing blouses and always have makeup jobs fresh out of a beauty salon
4426211 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4426212 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4426213 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4426214 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4426215 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4426216 yeah i get how this fits together i could build on this
4426217 chris works at a comic book shop so he reviews all the latest releases but the real awesomeness lies in his ability to find obscure or forgotten comic books and write hilariously sarcastic reviews that make fun of them they deserve it
4426218 these were the ghostbusters girls that one i grabbed her ass cause i wanted to see what her reaction was
4426219 whats policy and method of dealing with complaints about harassment
4426220 but what im asking is more hypothetical and informational if there is a set comic con policy on harassment and physical and verbal abuse on con attendees and exhibitors and if so whats the specific procedure by which someone should report it and specifically where should they go
4426221 comic con has zero tolerance for harassment or violence against any of our attendees or exhibitors please report instances to a security guard or the con office in room xxx
4426222 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4426223 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4426224 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4426225 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4426226 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4426227 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4426228 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4426229 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4426230 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4426232 movable type 4 2 was released today with a pile of new features and enhancements that make the payoff well worth the anticipation building on the solid foundation of its blogging and content management functionality mt 4 2 adds a substantial new set of functionality in support of social networking probably the most trumpeted accomplishment of movable type 4 2 is the improvement in speed across the board page publication speed has been greatly improved as has end user facing search movable types user community has been clamoring for these improvements for quite some time and 4 2 really delivers
4426233 movable type pro allows you turn your blog into a full social network platform with features like user registration profiles ratings forums
4426234 its been almost seven years since six apart embarked on its quest to make publishing available to everyone and it is still going strong in the new era however it is now all about the ability go beyond blogging and into the social publishing mt 4 2 is here to offer a new level of interaction between bloggers and audience integration with social networks and a lot more that is certainly a very interesting development in the world of blogging and well continue reporting on it
4426235 blogging pioneer six apart is souping up its movable type publishing platform with plans to release a new version that will include a slate of social networking features such as profiles and discussion forums six aparts evolution of its popular publishing platform is very much in keeping with the spirit of adding social features to content sites across the web
4426236 now that companies have begun to find more productive ways of interacting with their customers online six apart is capitalizing on this growing necessity with additional social networking tools that can be integrated with the movable type blogging platform
4426237 six apart summed todays release with a simple question what are the other things we can do with blogging six apart is certainly gaining a leg on its competition by jumping on the social bandwagon with what sounds to be a very polished and integrated package movable type pro is an appealing all in one package for bloggers and businesses looking to ride the social wave
4426238 the 4 2 platform gives blog publishers better performance according to six apart but the really interesting thing about this launch is the new social features in mt pro just as blogging is changing publishing social networking is going to change blogging
4426239 movable type gets social with pro version built on mt 4
4426240 blogging and social networking have been happy partners for some time so its not surprising that at least one blogging platform is making the most of that alliance in their latest pro version it sounds like a great out of the box solution for those already using or keen to use movable type who want to integrate more social tools
4426241 now the next revolution for publishing is to bring that same ease of creation to the process of building social networks with six aparts recent release of movable type 4 2 that revolution has begun the new release provides diy tools for building your own social networking platform which includes member profiles forums friending capabilities rating of content and more
4426242 considering blogs were the first link in the social networking chain it seems only right that it would come back full circle most bloggers use social networks extensively to extend the reach of their blog and it has become the common secondary effort of most bloggers so this move by sixapart is a savvy one that accepts the direction the web has gone and im definitely downloading and installing movabletype pro on one of my personal blogs to see what its all about
4426243 six apart today announced an update to movable type and the launch of movable type pro a new version thats designed to let you build your own social networking sites the announcement is good news for all bloggers because it raises the bar for blogging platforms if youve got a popular podcast blog or internet video youll soon be able to turn your site into a social network

4426246 this is a very exciting announcement for greensboro and the triad
4426247 volvo trucks north america is an outstanding corporate citizen and has had a huge impact on our community with the addition of mack trucks corporate headquarters their influence will only increase and that is very positive for the entire region
4426248 i think a lot of communities are valued on the company they keep or the companies they keep if you will
4426249 when you have a mack trucks a dell a volvo trucks a fedex or any of the international brands choose to put their headquarters or a major division in your community and in your region that adds validity to the message that we are trying to deliver to companies around the country and that is that this is a great place to do business
4426250 they can do better in north carolina they concluded than they can in pennsylvania
4426251 a lot of that had to do with the situation in allentown of course even though well be rejoicing locally you can imagine this will be devastating to the folks in allentown winston and greensboro have gone through their share of downsizing so we know what they are in for
4426252 were building back our economy that we lost through the manufacturing decline that weve had here certainly since the early 1990s
4426253 so i think that this will have a huge impact going forward its creating the professional high quality white collar jobs we lost some of those when some of the bigger textile companies ceased to exist
4426254 this is exactly the type of jobs you want to create that will have a lasting impact on the entire community
4426255 given our strong cluster in logistics the highway system and the support structure we have for that we would be very interested in working with them on their project
4426256 i couldnt do any of that without lauries help something i hope she realizes every day

4426289 tres cuestiones esenciales para baleares como son la inversi n estatal en el tranv a de la bah a de palma la cogesti n aeroportuaria y la soluci n a los problemas de transporte que implica la insularidad
4426290 estamos molestos y lamentamos que la titular de fomento la ministra lvarez venga a mallorca convoque a la prensa para visitar el aeropuerto y la capitan a mar tima y no se digne a hacer una reuni n con la conselleria de movilidad y ordenaci n del territorio y por extensi n con el govern balear cuando existen temas tan importantes para nuestras islas
4426291 un menosprecio incomprensible hacia el govern y hacia los ciudadanos de baleares
4426292 hace mucho que pedimos una entrevista con fomento para poder tratar la financiaci n del tranv a de la bah a de palma que qued fuera del convenio ferroviario y es algo urgente para baleares
4426293 que no se excluya a baleares de las inversiones que le corresponden
4426294 todos los aeropuertos espa oles tendr n el mismo tratamiento
4426295 tras la pol mica de cogesti n por excluir en un principio a los aeropuertos de baleares de este proceso de primera l nea y despu s de la visita del presidente rodr guez zapatero venir y no especificar qu pasar con nuestros aeropuertos es lamentable
4426296 no est n en primera l nea del proceso de cogesti n que quiera desarrollar el gobierno estatal
4426297 nuestra capacidad de decisi n en nuestros aeropuertos es mucho m s justificable que la de madrid y catalu a
4426298 por el n mero de visitantes de un aeropuerto es un planteamiento totalmente equivocado
4426299 el emisor de valores inclumplir las obligaciones establecidas en dicha ley
4426300 los emisores de valores deber n actuar con neutralidad aplicando los mismos criterios a las informaciones relevantes con independencia de que puedan influir de manera favorable o adversa en la cotizaci n de un valor
4426301 difundir inmediatamente al mercado y simult neamente a la comisi n nacional del mercado de valores cnmv toda la informaci n relevante tan pronto como sea conocido el hecho se haya adoptado la decisi n o se haya firmado el acuerdo o contrato de que se trate
4426302 en todo caso el emisor deber advertir expresamente y por escrito del posible car cter privilegiado de la informaci n y cumplir con las obligaciones establecidas por la normativa vigente en relaci n a la informaci n privilegiada
4426303 con el caso del banco popular ha habido una evidente mala pr ctica en algunos medios de los hechos anunciados a los producidos ha habido una distancia abismal y nadie da una explicaci n
4426304 no tengo nada que objetar a eso sino que son avances para evitar manipulaciones por parte de las fuentes
4426305 en el proceso informativo hay que defender la transparencia que la informaci n se produzca simult neamente para todo el mundo porque si el agente emisor decide privilegiar a uno u a otro va a ser siempre por su inter s

4426309 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4426310 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4426311 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4426312 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4426313 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cadillac cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4426314 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4426315 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4426316 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4426330 anche se non sono daccordo con mccain su numerose questioni ora sostengo lui perch come giuliani capisce la natura di quella che io definisco quarta guerra mondiale ed determinato a combatterla e a vincerla credo che seguir la strategia delineata dalla dottrina bush anche se probabilmente vorr metterci un suo marchio personale

4426396 i put a lot of energy into writing songs and trying to write songs
4426397 i see all the bits and pieces of songs i have laying around and it drives me crazy
4426398 i go to songwriting workshops given by people who make their living writing songs
4426399 i sometimes feel angry with lyrics and just go with the flow
4426400 i feel an overwhelming sense of satisfaction when i finish writing a song writing is difficult but i am always challenged to do my best sometimes i feel like songwriting should be called song rewriting because i spend a lot of time rewriting until the song is right

4426406 come mai i posti sono stati gi assegnati in tutti i convegni cui ho partecipato potevo sedermi dove mi faceva pi comodo
4426407 nulla in contrario a sedere allo stesso tavolo con lei
4426408 laltra parte della quota di partecipazione deve consegnarla direttamente al presidente berlusconi tutti gli altri lhanno gi fatto resta soltanto lei
4426409 rather than update existing systems we wanted to start afresh implementing the latest
4426410 mereka pas akan menamakan sesiapa sahaja yang dilantik sebagai perdana menteri asalkan dia melaksanakan islam
4426411 saya ucapkan terima kasih kepada ustaz hadi atas penegasan mengenai arahan yang diberikan kepada ahli ahli pas dalam ucapan dasarnya hari ini
4426412 ia adalah penting bagi pakatan rakyat ke arah perundingan yang lebih matang
4426413 kita yakin bahawa bn akan menabur wang yang banyak nanti
4426414 saya tidak dapat hendak menjelaskan secara terperinci dalam pada muktamar hari ini kerana ia memerlukan masa
4426415 beberapa keputusan akan dibuat bagaimana hendak tingkatkan lagi parti di negeri terbabit
4426416 lagi pun peguam yang membela ketua umum keadilan itu diketuai haji sulaiman abdullah bersama lapan lagi peguam mempunyai hubungan secara tidak langsung dengan pas
4426417 tidak semestinya kita berada di depan ketika di mahkamah semasa kes anwar disebut sedangkan kita sentiasa mengadakan perbincangan dengan peguam terbabit dari semasa ke semasa
4426418 but the voices grew louder about what could come down at the convention all those kinds of realities started to take place the reality of what outside groups had in mind the rumblings
4426419 for me its very ironic that the book itself is a victim of extremism does that mean women cannot even discuss extremism
4426420 what do they want us to do lie down and shut up
4426421 we are baffled as to why the book is banned
4426422 di negeri inilah tertubuhnya hizbul muslimin pada 1948 di maahad ihya as syarif gunung semanggol
4426423 di sini jugalah pada 1955 pas mula mengenal erti demokrasi pilihan raya
4426424 di perak jugalah dewan ulamak pas ditubuhkan secara rasmi di batu 20 bagan datoh pada 1957
4426425 kita juga sama sama mengikhlaskan niat dan amal perbuatan kita semata mata kerana allah untuk melaksanakan tugas dan amanah yang amat berat di muka bumi ini
4426426 mommy b said i really have a gift for working with clay
4426427 i wanted to go out and win this for my father
4426428 its just so cool that he was in the olympics 20 years ago and i wanted to bring home the all around medal he almost won
4426429 its not possible to describe how proud i am its just an amazing feeling
4426430 im so proud to be wearing this silver medal for the usa
4426431 if youre wondering if michael phelps is good enough to do it with his eyes closed he is
4426432 i wrote a post a couple months back about how comcast was using twitter for customer service and made me a happy customer
4426433 all that matters is us and what the players who are here at the moment think
4426434 people try to put a lot of expectations on us but we are hard enough on ourselves we have got our own expectations and pressures i think that is harder to face
4426435 for 100 years young new zealand players have flourished under these pressures so nothing has changed players have traditionally come to the party or they havent
4426436 that is the process we are finding out who has got it who is going to be a long term player for the all blacks and one or two have put up their hands they are a great group really approachable and i love coaching them they are a group that wants to learn and that is what is important to us
4426437 i would be surprised if they were ever in fear of the all blacks they are springboks they have a great tradition its only over the last 20 years that the balance of the games has tipped in the all blacks favour so it would surprise me if the springboks have ever feared us
4426438 whether there has been a change i dont know but there has been a change in the coaching style and their up front nature has altered yes whether that is one of the springbok coachs strategies to try and create an attitude that we are not as good as people think i am not too sure
4426439 there are a lot of doubters around but we dont doubt the team has got the heart to do it but it is a big challenge to take that intensity of auckland off shore and put it on the track at newlands will take some doing
4426440 we cant do it for them you can talk about what its going to be like and try and re create situations at training but you cant get into it but we trust these boys and believe they are going to put it all on the park on saturday whether thats good enough to win or not we will see
4426441 i dont think what they did to argentina last weekend 63 9 will have any bearing whatsoever to this match
4426442 it was pretty heart breaking getting that close especially when we were trying to defend our trophy
4426443 we just couldnt get our noses in front but in professional sport that sometimes happens tyro henderson the south african playing for middlesex bowled a beautiful last over to justin kemp and kempy just couldnt quite get us over the finish line it would be great for team spirit and the club in general if we could bring some silverware home from lords this saturday
4426444 i used to start holding the bat with my hands pretty low on it
4426445 it meant i had to take the bat back quite a long way and i felt a little rushed every time
4426446 now although it is not exactly baseball style i start with a back lift a lot higher it just means i have a little more time
4426447 i have no idea at all mate when i have looked at the averages in the past i havent carried it on and thats why i havent wanted to check up on the statistics this time experience has taught me not to look at those figures i play better without thinking about what ive done in the past
4426448 he is a class player we know he will come off
4426449 he has found it pretty tough this season but im not sure why a lot of players go through bad trots and he wanted to do so well maybe he has put too much pressure on himself but we have had a long chat this week and hopefully he will show his top form at lords for this final
4426450 he is such an athlete he has contributed with the bat and ball hes a great all round cricketer
4426451 we dont want to think about losing this one so we have to dig deep it will be a great occasion its always special when you go to lords but especially for a final before a full house and especially so for south africans when you grow up at home in south africa of all the places you want to play in the world you think you would like to play at lords one day now were going to do it and we have to make it count
4426452 for example our police chief mr calvin has 244 hours sick leave i would like to change this
4426453 i dont want to penalize these men im just trying to cleanup some things
4426454 and then make any changes effective the first of the year
4426455 if you would like to clean up the books make me out a check
4426456 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4426457 every day shelter is seeing more and more ordinary hardworking people who are terrified of losing their homes theyre being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4426458 tens of thousands are living with the fear of having the home theyve worked so hard for being repossessed by lenders with little compassion
4426459 lenders must play their part and ensure they look at all the options before rushing to the court and use repossession as the last rather than first option
4426460 the government needs to show it really is on peoples side when they are facing the threat of repossession
4426461 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4426462 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort
4426463 i was hoping you would have some explanation of the specifically the helmets during the purdue game last year indiana wore throw back unis to honor the 1968 rose bowl team they liked the helmet so much they kept the double stripes with the current logo and wore it for the in tempe rumor has it that they might make it a permanent addition can you uncover this

4426466 el dolor nuestro optimismo no arrebate y que sea m s bien de la victoria un nuevo anuncio
4426467 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4426468 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4426469 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4426470 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4426471 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4426472 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4426473 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4426474 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4426475 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4426476 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4426477 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4426478 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4426479 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4426480 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4426481 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4426482 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4426483 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4426484 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4426485 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4426486 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4426487 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4426488 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4426489 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4426490 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4426491 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4426492 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4426493 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4426494 in 18 years of taking part in debates i have never seen an incident like this one
4426495 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

4426505 18 426 solicitudes nuevas para construir viviendas de protecci n lo que supone un crecimiento de un 41 sobre el a o anterior
4426506 la falta de confianza de las familias en el futuro de la econom a unida al encarecimiento de las hipotecas con la subida de los tipos de inter s a la expectativa de ca das de precios en las viviendas y las dificultades de financiaci n han provocado que la venta de viviendas en espa a disminuya sensiblemente

4426508 existe un stock de viviendas que en las circunstancias presentes no encuentran salida en el mercado

4426510 soy liberal y tengo la convicci n profunda de que el mercado es el mecanismo de ajuste entre las expectativas de los compradores y de vendedores de vivienda pero eso no quita que desde las administraciones p blicas facilitemos al m ximo el proceso de ajuste

4426512 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4426513 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4426514 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4426515 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4426516 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4426517 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4426518 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this

4426536 executive orders are the best known way that the president makes official statements about how the executive branch of the federal government is run
4426537 presidents have used executive orders throughout our history beginning with george washington those early executive orders were nothing more than internal memoranda through which the president communicated with staff and department heads detailing how the executive branch would implement a new law or regulation
4426538 the seminal case of youngstown sheet amp tube in 1952 laid out very very broad but very relevant language saying in essence that the presidents power for the executive order must arise either from an act of congress or from the constitution itself
4426539 we were all taught very early in our years about the separations of
4426540 at the heart of the constitution of the united states of america is the separation of legislative executive and judicial powers james madison the father of our constitution wrote in federalist 47 there can be no liberty when those powers are united in one person or body of magistrates supreme court justice louis brandeis echoed this view in 1926 when he observed that separation of powers was written into our constitution to save the people from autocracy yet throughout most of the 20th century presidents have usurped legislative power by means of unconstitutional executive orders presidential proclamations and undeclared wars for too long congress has stood silent and worse yet aided and abetted these usurpations through legislation granting broad powers to the president only by repealing those statutes and by placing express limits on presidential power will such constitutional abuses be stopped

4426612 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4426613 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4426614 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4426615 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4426616 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4426617 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4426618 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4426619 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4426620 eis que conceber s em teu seio e dar s luz um filho e tu o chamar s com o nome de jesus

4426623 in 18 years of taking part in debates i have never seen an incident like this one
4426624 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
4426625 i have a problem with fully grown men playing with balls that are not their own
4426626 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
4426627 hopefully in light of this incident the taboo subject of sexual harassment will finally be discussed widely on college campuses
4426628 the way i guess what front runner means and the way i think about it is completely different from what theyre using it
4426629 front runners is like people who only show up when youre winning
4426630 but there are a lot of times where it makes it harder to play at home when theyre against you or it feels like theyre against you
4426631 if they want to boo me thats fine thats fine its not going to effect me from doing my job
4426632 wanting to get married and not going online will soon be seen as equivalent to trying to find an address by driving around randomly rather than using a map
4426633 people arent that great at describing themselves accurately so expect more experiential online dating activities and games that help you get to know someone
4426634 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4426635 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4426636 i look forward to going to poland to sign that agreement soon
4426637 its important for the peace and security of the region its important for peace and security internationally
4426638 acho que foi algum tipo de bala n o posso dizer mais nada no momento porque n o conseguimos ver ningu m e n o sabemos quem atirou
4426639 i wasnt going to step into this one because im thinking if you dont already get it my words probably wont change your mind however there are a couple of points i think need to be made
4426640 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4426641 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4426642 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4426643 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4426644 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4426645 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4426646 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4426647 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4426648 only a few people are still with him and he only wants two things indemnity for the sins and crimes he committed in the past eight years and a piece of land so he can live rest of his life there

4426662 libraries are facing competition from television magazines the internet e books yet they have this archaic and mad idea of charging people money for being slightly late
4426663 its all so negative unprofessional and unbusinesslike like any business libraries need not to alienate their customers
4426664 my personal view is that theyre past their sell by date because they do sustain a very old fashioned image of libraries which is out of sync with todays modern library environment and the image libraries are trying to project tolerant responsive flexible stimulating
4426665 ive met plenty of ex borrowers who say they paid a few medium sized fines and decided it was cheaper and more convenient for them to buy the books and stopped using the library
4426666 no one would argue against a parking or speeding fine if we didnt have speeding fines it wouldnt mean that people behaved better on the roads
4426667 if fines were removed as an income stream no matter what the strength of argument might be it would seriously challenge the budgetary position of many library services
4426668 when fine income is being used by libraries to run libraries i think its madness
4426669 weve got to the stage that our fines are now paying for the library service
4426670 we never have enough copies of driving theory test manuals or the life in the uk citizenship books on the shelves how do we stop borrowers from keeping the books for the months up to their tests and depriving other users i dont believe the public are all selfish but it only needs a very small percentage of bad apples to cause problems
4426671 this is primarily a matter for library authorities but clearly it is in the interests of all library users that books are returned on time mla best practice advice would to recommend that authorities politely alert customers before they go overdue and to avoid the word fine in preference for charge

4426741 what has happened is basically that we have got better with the choice we are offering students and we have got better at inclusive learning
4426742 we are using as many teaching techniques as possible so no one is excluded from learning
4426743 there is obviously going to be a plateau to be honest what should be realistic and achievable is 100 per cent pass rates and the reason why is because we have to think about the point where we only enrol students on courses we know they are capable of
4426744 i would not say every student should be getting a grades then something would be wrong
4426745 but 100 per cent achievement should be attainable if we are not then it means we have not enrolled the right students or we have not given them the right advice or guidance or something has gone wrong
4426746 that has helped a lot to support them to improve grades without making it easier there is a lot of focus to constantly improve the way we teach and the way we work with students
4426747 there is also a much wider choice than there used to be
4426748 they require students to have very good analytical skills producing answers to those is not the result of spoon feeding
4426749 i would like to congratulate all of kents a level students and wish them every success im pleased with the continued upward trend which bodes well for the future

4426755 mccains inability to match bushs performance in attracting traditional republican donors illustrates the fundraising gap between the candidates salant finds
4426756 obama is seeking to bring in double or triple the 84 1 million in federal funds that mccain will have to spend in the final two months before the nov 4 election in june obama declined to accept public financing which caps his spending at the federal allotment
4426757 not all republicans are opening their wallets to a mccain presidential run mallory factor a banker who co hosts a weekly meeting of conservatives in new york and raised more than 1 million for bush and his party four years ago told bloomberg
4426758 some republicans who support certain principles are shunning mccain factor said citing the arizona senators initial opposition to bushs tax cuts and his authorship of a campaign finance law opposed by many in his party
4426759 disdain for mccain is combined with enthusiasm for obama in some quarters salant adds

4426764 it appears as if the unconstitutionality and the draconian nature of the proposed expropriation bill have dawned upon the policy makers and responsible members of the governing party in parliament
4426765 rather than adopting this ill conceived and unnecessary bill the government should instead enter into serious negotiations with organised agriculture and other affected interests to reach agreement on a land reform process that will be just and equitable non divisive effective economically acceptable expeditious and agriculturally sustainable

4426835 demonstrators were often penned in on the sidewalk in many cases over a dozen blocks away from the rally site and told they would be arrested if they tried to exit
4426836 the police used pepper spray and batons on the crowd and in some cases actually picked up the metal barricades and used them to push people
4426837 ban a lot of people from flying because of that
4426838 which fast is the most meritorious after the fasts of ramadan
4426839 messenger of allah i have seen you fasting in the month of shaban so frequently that i have never seen you fasting in any other month
4426840 that shaban is a month between rajab and ramadan which is neglected by many people and it is a month in which an account of the deeds of human beings is presented before the lord of the universe so i wish that my deeds be presented at a time when i am in a state of fasting
4426841 prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam used to fast the whole of shaban i said to him messenger of allah is shaban your most favorite month for fasting he said in this month allah prescribes the list of the persons dying this year therefore i like that my death comes when i am in a state of fasting
4426842 prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam would sometimes begin to fast continuously until we thought he would not stop fasting and sometimes he used to stop fasting until we thought he would never fast i never saw the messenger of allah sall allahu alayhi wa sallam fasting a complete month except the month of ramadan and i have never seen him fasting in a month more frequently than he did in shaban
4426843 i never saw the messenger of allah sall allahu alayhi wa sallam fasting in a month so profusely as he did in the month of shaban he used to fast in that month leaving only a few days rather he used to fast almost the whole of the month
4426844 i have never seen the messenger of allah fasting for two months continuously except in the months of shaban and ramadan
4426845 do not fast after the first half of the month of shaban is gone
4426846 do not precede the month of ramadan with one or two fasts
4426847 once prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam performed the salah of the night tahajjud and made a very long sajdah until i feared that he had passed away
4426848 allah almighty descends in a manner he best knows it in the night occurring in the middle of shaban and forgives a large number of people more than the number of the fibers on the sheep of the tribe kalb
4426849 this is the middle night of shaban allah frees in it a large number of the people from fire more than the number of the hair growing on the sheep of the tribe kalb but he does not even look at a person who associates partners with allah or at a person who nourishes malice in his heart against someone or at a person who cuts off the ties of kinship or at a man who leaves his clothes extending beyond his ankles as a sign of pride or at a person who disobeys his parents or at a person who has a habit of drinking wine
4426850 allah almighty looks upon all those created by him in the middle night of shaban and forgives all those created by him except the one who associates partners with him or the one who has malice in his heart against a muslim

4426853 the originals seem to approach the classic middle as almost a genre they have the same well played catchy up tempo melodic punk with sung vocals and shouted chorus and 50s b movie horror and sci fi themes like other bands who have picked up this sound and run with it its often more enjoyable of a listen than the slowed metallic route the actual former misfits members since have taken

4426873 s lo puede lamentarse que en esta dificil sima situaci n el lado americano est empeorando las relaciones con rusia
4426874 el hecho de que esto se haya firmado en un periodo de una crisis muy dif cil en las relaciones entre rusia y estados unidos sobre la situaci n en georgia demuestra que por supuesto el sistema de defensa de misiles ser desplegado no contra ir n sino contra el potencial estrat gico de rusia
4426875 finalmente hemos sido entendidos en nuestro punto de vista de que polonia siendo un miembro crucial en la organizaci n del tratado del atl ntico norte otan y un importante amigo y aliado de estados unidos tambi n debe estar a salvo

4426880 no aceptamos ese regalo a los colonos que obtienen en compensaci n por su acci n ilegal la construcci n de una nueva colonia

4426920 today when i talked to head coach greg schiano the things he was saying to me really made me commit to them he was telling me how he has a vision for the team and that he is working toward his goal on visions from god he wants players coming to represent the school well and as a young man full of faith i really want to play for a coach that has a strong belief as well
4426921 hes kind of separated himself from the rest of the pack to be eligible to compete
4426922 so if you set yourself apart you need to give him a chance to compete

4426927 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4426928 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4426929 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4426930 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes
4426931 you have no idea how things are ranked and whats going on

4426934 ich glaube dass wir mit chelsea jeden titel holen k nnen
4426935 ich glaube dass er die gesamte spielzeit die rolle einnehmen kann die ihn in der r ckrunde ausgezeichnet hat er wird sein hohes niveau halten denn er hat sich l ngst an die liga gew hnt
4426936 das spiel gibt uns viel selbstvertrauen f r die liga

4426956 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4426957 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4426958 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4426959 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4426977 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4426978 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4426979 it needs to be a formal ceasefire which is what we are working on
4426980 but in order to get to that point there really does have to be important clarifications on a couple of these points in the ceasefire in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected because the united states would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests are not protected

4426985 when purchasing a costume masks beards and wigs look for the label flame resistant although this label does not mean these items wont catch fire it does indicate the items will resist burning and should extinguish quickly once removed from the ignition source to minimize the risk of contact with candles or other sources of ignition avoid costumes made with flimsy materials and outfits with big baggy sleeves or billowing skirts

4426990 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4426991 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4426992 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4426993 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4426994 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4426995 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4426996 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4426997 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe
4426998 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4426999 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4427000 we have to get him ready to go to jesus
4427001 there are no excuses for this to happen to any baby
4427002 this is murder he had no reason to die he died because he cried
4427003 i mean not only did crystal and craig lose a son but crystal lost a husband and craigs parents lost a son and a grandson one day this was a happy perfect family and the next day its been devastated
4427004 maybe they both could have used a meeting that night
4427005 like two telephone poles with the lines between them cut
4427006 they pulled together they prayed together they took baby camryn off life support together
4427007 and that was a wonderful thing that they were able to pull together like that despite craig being alleged to have done these things
4427008 i dont care what craigs family members think he did this to my son may he get what he deserves maybe people should talk more about camryn than craig craigs name has no worth to even be mentioned
4427009 the question becomes if that autopsy is accurate if this child has been severely injured to the point that his ribs were fractured on prior occasions multiple occasions how come no one knew that
4427010 he only made the confession after the detectives involved started talking about other possibilities of how this child could have been injured what other folks in the household could have injured him then craig quickly took responsibility
4427011 no matter what happens craig is going to very likely spend the majority of his adult life in prison
4427012 if thats the breadwinner or the main breadwinner then youve got some serious financial problems right off the bat
4427013 i lost my job because of this because i couldnt work enough hours now i have to move into a smaller place
4427014 it will be the basis for divorces itll be the basis for the kind of family conflict that then brings into play maternal and paternal grandparents and the extended family on both sides and we end up with a lot of conflict
4427015 i cant have hate eat me up and beat me down i cant live like that
4427016 i will have to one day forgive him so that i might find peace
4427017 today marks the beginning of a new chapter for aar in rwanda through the consultative period we remained optimistic that we would be enabled to resume provision of quality healthcare solutions

4427021 im sure fulham will still be riding high after promotion
4427022 we finished third last season and had a cup final appearance so were going to be one of those teams that that people will raise their game for
4427023 it will be almost like a cup tie we need to stay sharp and stay focused or well get turned over
4427024 but i was able to play many of the first team in a friendly against leeds city vixens this week id like to thank the vixens for a great game and for helping us out at such short notice we really do appreciate it
4427025 now we need to build on that and get a win against fulham and give ourselves the momentum and confidence to go forward into the season proper
4427026 we are in the scenario now where we are in the build up to a big tournament so its a vital match for us with our final qualifier against portugal at wembley on the horizon
4427027 friendlies are not friendlies when you play for england and as a patriot i was very proud every time i played for my country players are judged each time they pull on a shirt for england
4427028 and ive always said if you play for your country you are playing for two caps play well in one game and youll give yourself a chance for another opportunity in the next match
4427029 ive picked a strong squad for this game and its down to those individuals now and anyone outside that squad to really start trying to nail down a place for the final squad next summer should we qualify for sweden
4427030 its not me that picks the squad its the players themselves and their performances that will pick the squad
4427031 but they are not thinking that this is make or break what is important are the big british moments
4427032 i dont think people really sit there wondering where we finished on the medals table
4427033 what they remember is kelly holmes steve redgrave matt pinsent chris hoy or nicole cooke
4427034 people are excited about it already and they know that they we have a very good start
4427035 we had a gold and a bronze in the pool we are going back a long way when you remember a day like that in the pool and a gold medal in road cycling
4427036 people at home know that we are witnessing a step change and i hope it continues right the way through
4427037 im not going to minimise the importance of our track and field count
4427038 we got out of jail in athens in track and field because of one moment that was more luck than judgement and one huge moment with kelly holmes that i had thought could happen
4427039 take the 4x100m relay and kelly holmes out of the mix and it wasnt a great track and field championships we hardly got a single male individual through to a final in athens
4427040 i have read what karl eats for breakfast but what does he and matt eat while on the trail during the day
4427041 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
4427042 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4427043 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4427044 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday

4427047 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
4427048 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee

4427050 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
4427051 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
4427052 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
4427053 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
4427054 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
4427055 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
4427056 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
4427057 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
4427058 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
4427059 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things
4427060 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the us department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38
4427061 donate 60 million doses of h5n1 vaccine to the world health organization who over 3 years for the establishment of an h5n1 vaccine global stockpile
4427062 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
4427063 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players

4427065 the transformation of poultry production in asia in recent decades is staggering in the southeast asian countries where most of the bird flu outbreaks are concentrated thailand indonesia and viet nam production jumped eightfold in just 30 years from around 300 000 metric tonnes mt of chicken meat in 1971 to 2 440 000 mt in 2001 chinas production of chicken tripled during the 1990s to over 9 million metric tons per year
4427066 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4427067 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4427068 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
4427069 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
4427070 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
4427071 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4427072 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
4427073 all i can remember is going up i went up and i came down and i hit something very very hard
4427074 a soldier told me i hit the footpath but as far as i was concerned i thought i hit a telegraph pole cause all i could see was sparks and the smell of rubber
4427075 i looked down and i could see annes skirt and i thought oh poor annes been injured too
4427076 i thought wheres the rest of the girls and they werent i couldnt see anybody
4427077 i think the intelligence services have not fully cooperated with the investigation
4427078 my father said and i do believe his words theres a time for you to be born into this world and a time for you to be taken out of it
4427079 thats quite true cause its been proved cause all those people round me were all taken and i was saved but in saying that it was a hard fight a very hard fight

4427114 ian is a very tactical racer a lot of people outside the sport think road racers are just mental but its not like that a lot of tactics and strategy go in the races where his preparation and ability come through are the best races for me
4427115 motorcycle racers tend to be quite similar none of them really has a plan which i find very strange when i ran the accident and repair garage i always had a plan you have to have a plan in business ask a typical racer what hes going to do when he retires or when hes going to retire and he wont know

4427119 de grootste groep van meisjes met een hoofddoek leggen zich neer bij een verbod van de school maar voelen er zich absoluut niet goed bij dit is niet zonder gevolgen de leerlingen in kwestie krijgen in de school voortdurend de boodschap dat ze niet mogen zijn wie ze zijn en dit op het moment dat ze in een fase van hun leven zijn waarin ze hun identiteit ontwikkelen zon afwijzing van hun identiteit heeft een grote impact op hun zelfbeeld
4427120 wat de regelgeving betreft is de zaak erg onduidelijk tot op vandaag mogen scholen autonoom beslissen of het dragen van een hoofddoek toegelaten is of niet wanneer de problemen aangekaart worden bij de lokale overlegplatforms en de commissie inzake leerlingenrechten wordt verwezen naar de beperkte decretale bevoegdheden die deze organen hebben dan rest er enkel nog de rechtbank wat voor veel mensen een hoogdrempelige dure onderneming is er is dus dringend nood aan een duidelijke regelgeving die discriminatie op dit vlak verbiedt

4427143 this was probably a result of poor information to a young athlete who was not sure what she could take

4427213 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4427214 my belief is that the president does not intend to leave the country there is no question of him leaving pakistan
4427215 it becomes very unimportant for me to comment on these reports i have been hearing all this for the past many months
4427216 musharraf will neither face impeachment nor be prosecuted we expect a major development in the next 48 hours
4427217 i didnt look at the other races before i started
4427218 i was sure i had to run with no mistakes
4427219 the hochschorner brothers had 4 penalty seconds and were in second place after the semifinal but posted the best combined time of 190
4427220 it was bad luck for them but we were happy
4427221 we havent won a medal in 48 years ive been anticipating this match since the athens olympics
4427222 for us to get the finals we feel like weve already done really well china is definitely stronger than us and all we can do is compete besides the chinese were the next best team
4427223 i accuse the government of russia of a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing
4427224 weve received 14 000 reports of brutal attacks slaughter rapes and internment of people in violation of the rules of the geneva convention and international humanitarian law
4427225 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4427226 well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap
4427227 we are still in the negotiating process russians are trying to justify their invasion and to legalize their presence in georgia
4427228 i think we should take a closer look at it the peace agreement
4427229 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4427230 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the un security council
4427231 we never use cluster bombs there is no need to do so
4427232 i have been greatly encouraged by both the prime minister and the vice president and now believe that it is time to return home and make any contribution i can to the future of my country
4427233 i intend to speak my mind on what i feel needs to be done i have no political affiliations my obligations are solely to the people of kenya particularly the poor the dispossessed and those in need
4427234 i want to see that i am praying that has happened
4427235 what has happened with kenya has been really unfortunate and like all kenyans im very very relieved that the violence we saw came to an end
4427236 i have listened to the alleged tape recorded evidence it is truncated inaudible insufficient and inadmissible to form any credible proof of the allegations being orchestrated by mr githongo
4427237 the thieves who moved at night and in small numbers stole few cattle and used mainly spears and shields bows and arrows
4427238 in the confrontations cultural norms were respected children and women were not purposely killed

4427240 after the fall of idi amin communities helped themselves to the abandoned arms in moroto barracks
4427241 cattle rustling is a crime that has serious implications on the security peace and the well being of the pastoral communities
4427242 if left untamed it can mutate into a complex security threat
4427243 research indicates there exists a deep understanding of the problem of cattle rustling
4427244 the project a joint effort between police organisation and the security institute seeks to implement the protocol on the prevention combating and eradication of cattle rustling
4427245 regional cooperation among practitioners on cattle rustling will be required
4427246 it is closely linked to conflict and insecurity in the region as well as the proliferation of small arms and light weapons
4427247 after the signing ceremony the protocol is expected to be ratified within one year
4427248 the incident is unprecedented the ministry has been shocked by what happened and would like to get to the bottom of this matter i take this opportunity to express my condolences to the bereaved families and all people who have been affected in one way or the other by the incident
4427249 can new media work with the old guard and old media

4427257 obama has repeatedly used the words bamboozled and hoodwinked in framing his argument that the truth has been hidden from voters

4427260 i think it is a perfect illustration of the fact that high performance reliability and increase of pace can go hand in hand
4427261 imagine taking a vacation to cancun six months from now you are probably thinking about beaches sunsets and other abstract information on the other hand if you were going to cancun tomorrow you would be thinking about taxi cabs and boarding passes concrete concerns making you more likely to process information about speedy check in or the phone number of a taxi
4427262 similarly a voter facing a choice in the distant future is less interested in particular plans and policies and is more persuaded by broad abstract ideas it is only as the election gets closer that voters start paying attention to concrete details of the candidate s positions in essence when the choice is far away a voter is more likely to think in abstract terms but as the choice approaches the voter puts more weight on the details
4427263 what this finding implies is that the people who typically decide elections voters in the middle are most susceptible to this type of persuasion political novices tend to be more persuaded by abstract messages when the choice is far off and by concrete messages when the choice is imminent
4427264 the fit of the right message with the right voter at the right time has never been more important to the outcome of a race

4427267 libraries are facing competition from television magazines the internet e books yet they have this archaic and mad idea of charging people money for being slightly late
4427268 its all so negative unprofessional and unbusinesslike like any business libraries need not to alienate their customers
4427269 my personal view is that theyre past their sell by date because they do sustain a very old fashioned image of libraries which is out of sync with todays modern library environment and the image libraries are trying to project tolerant responsive flexible stimulating
4427270 ive met plenty of ex borrowers who say they paid a few medium sized fines and decided it was cheaper and more convenient for them to buy the books and stopped using the library
4427271 no one would argue against a parking or speeding fine if we didnt have speeding fines it wouldnt mean that people behaved better on the roads
4427272 if fines were removed as an income stream no matter what the strength of argument might be it would seriously challenge the budgetary position of many library services
4427273 when fine income is being used by libraries to run libraries i think its madness
4427274 weve got to the stage that our fines are now paying for the library service
4427275 we never have enough copies of driving theory test manuals or the life in the uk citizenship books on the shelves how do we stop borrowers from keeping the books for the months up to their tests and depriving other users i dont believe the public are all selfish but it only needs a very small percentage of bad apples to cause problems
4427276 this is primarily a matter for library authorities but clearly it is in the interests of all library users that books are returned on time mla best practice advice would to recommend that authorities politely alert customers before they go overdue and to avoid the word fine in preference for charge

4427320 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4427321 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal

4427329 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4427330 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4427331 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4427332 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4427333 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4427334 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4427335 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4427336 in heaven there may be some evidence down in the lolo forest because thats where we were

4427370 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4427371 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4427372 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4427373 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4427374 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4427375 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4427376 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4427377 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4427394 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4427395 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4427396 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4427397 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee

4427539 when we asked men and women about the causes of stress while driving responses for both sexes ranged from other drivers on the road to poor road conditions heavy traffic unfamiliar roads bad weather and kids in the back seat
4427540 driving on unfamiliar roads affected significantly more women than it did men and when it came to driving in bad weather one in three women said they felt stressed compared to just one in seven men
4427541 interestingly mens patience was more likely to fray when fighting heavy traffic with more men admitting it made their stress levels spike stress can cloud driving judgment for both men and women

4427546 no one could believe peaches had invited faris round as soon as she got back never mind let him stay the night
4427547 they were a couple before she went to las vegas then she decides to get married on a whim comes back and rings up faris as if what she has done is the most normal thing in the world
4427548 she lives in a bubble and is loving all the attention but shes a married woman now and needs to grow up
4427549 he didnt know what was going on and was pretty upset he had to read about it in the papers
4427550 faris knew peaches was going to the states for work but that was it
4427551 he feels hes been made a bit of a laughing stock during all of this and is only now getting to the bottom of what exactly happened
4427552 he looked absolutely crestfallen and it was obvious he wasnt happy

4427556 details of the sites look are scarce but it will feature more videos and pictorials and less editorial content

4427562 we still hang she was just out with me a couple days ago and we were having a great time shes really got it i think shes great
4427563 the reason for destruction of all my relationships is that im passionate about being on the road and making music i have great relationships but the women i date dont realise that i spend between six and eight months of my life on the road touring or travelling or seeing family with my daughters

4427580 we gave it a lot of opportunities to find its way back but when he hit arbutus thats just a tough place
4427581 but as has been the case with this bear he simply made another wrong turn
4427582 worst case scenario you have the bear struck on an eight lane highway injured and in close proximity to humans
4427583 thats just a situation likely to end with a bad outcome
4427584 that bears been through a real ordeal the last few weeks wed hate for people to get out and look to bother it

4427591 its improving all the time were quite happy with it now
4427592 my vets been watching him every day and hes quite happy with him
4427593 track rider les beer rode him this morning and said he felt super he walked a lap of the steeple track and then cantered a lap and he said he felt terrific
4427594 the rvl vet was happy with him the other day so i dont think it will be a problem
4427595 the horse looks terrific and he has done everything we have asked of him we havent asked him to do a lot but hes such a natural athlete he just wants to do it
4427596 theres no doubt hes up in class but hes meeting these horses at the right time and has the fitness on them for sure and that could be a big factor
4427597 theyve all had trials but theres nothing like having that race experience on board and weve got that
4427598 hes flying at the moment and has done so well since the missile win so i couldnt have him any better for saturday
4427599 the way hes going there is no doubt hes got the form and just as importantly the fitness to accommodate the step up in class
4427600 hes a lot more adaptable than people think and has the ability to race pretty close if he has to tim will know what to do
4427601 shes fine it was always the plan to go to the toy show we just wanted keep our options open
4427602 shes been jumping well in trials she was terrible out of the gates early days and messed her races up by getting back too far
4427603 but shes much more seasoned now i think youll find shell jump hold a nice spot in the race and shes probably our best chance of the day id say
4427604 its hard for her not to go well first up the way she is shes one of those mares that just train up im pretty happy with her
4427605 i think in a trafficky type of race shes going to get back midfield and shes going to need a bit of luck to get runs
4427606 im very happy with her and hopefully she has clear running and she can hit the line strongly and go to 1400 metres next start where shes better suited
4427607 were back to 1100 metres the rail is out eight metres and hes drawn out 12 but were going to ride him to find his feet
4427608 hopefully there will be good speed on hes a really nice horse and i think hes quick enough and hopefully good enough to be setting him for the caulfield guineas rather than the victoria derby

4427615 cristo es cabeza de la iglesia la cual es su cuerpo y l es su salvador
4427616 someti todas las cosas bajo sus pies y lo dio por cabeza sobre todas las cosas a la iglesia
4427617 no llam is padre vuestro a nadie en la tierra porque uno es vuestro padre el que est en los cielos
4427618 mirad por todos vosotros y por el reba o en que el esp ritu santo os ha puesto por obispos para apacentar la iglesia del se or
4427619 por esta causa te dej en creta para que establecieses ancianos en cada ciudad as como yo te mand

4427624 no permito a la mujer ense ar ni ejercer dominio sobre el hombre
4427625 porque ad n fue formado primero despu s eva y ad n no fue enga ado sino la mujer

4427628 la copa de bendici n no es la comuni n de la sangre de cristo el pan que partimos no es la comuni n del cuerpo de cristo
4427629 el que come mi carne y bebe mi sangre tiene vida eterna
4427630 en cuanto a la ofrenda para los santos haced vosotros de la manera que orden en las iglesias de galacia
4427631 porque si primero hay la voluntad dispuesta ser acepta seg n lo que uno tiene no seg n lo que no tiene
4427632 cada uno d como propuso en su coraz n no con tristeza ni por necesidad porque dios ama al dador alegre
4427633 por avaricia har n mercader a de vosotros con palabras fingidas

4427647 the new lineups will be divided into distinct genre based categories making it simple to search for and find news sports childrens programming educational shows and more at the touch of the remote
4427648 the new channel locations also help make these local channel lineups more consistent with other comcast service areas throughout maryland
4427649 we are confident that once customers experience the ease and intuitiveness of the new lineup they will love it
4427650 the industry is taking responsibility for correcting a problem they helped create and thats a good thing
4427651 the fundamental goal has been to return money into the hands of investors and thats what these deals do
4427652 when people say its the worst its ever been its usually the bottom and the time to start to buy
4427653 the global economy is sputtering amidst a widening in the slowdown from the united states to western europe and japan
4427654 at its current price of 175 27 per share apples stock is trading at 33 9x our fiscal 2008 estimate of 5 17 we set our six month price target at 184 00 this represents a p e multiple of 35 6x our fiscal 2008 estimate which is still a premium to the industry but more accurately reflects the current outlook
4427655 i believe investors have become overly fixated on apples expected accounting income while ignoring apples impressive free cash flow generating ability free cash flow not earnings reported in the accounting statements determines the true value of a firm
4427656 the price earnings multiple p e is an increasingly useless metric when valuing apple inc
4427657 apples stock price is cheap if you use cgm as your valuation metric
4427658 i was a bit disappointed with his first up run but he was coming back from a 2400 metre preparation and the eye injury
4427659 hes still got some discolouration in his eye and the vet now says he could have it for the rest of his life
4427660 hes got no problem with his sight but im hoping it hasnt caused him to lose confidence
4427661 hes improved quite a lot since his first up run and i think he can just about win tomorrow as its not a particularly strong race
4427662 hell need to win or run well to warrant taking down for the newcastle cup and hopefully the metropolitan
4427663 he was nominated for the cups races last year in melbourne and his owner suggested we nominate him again this year in case his form is good enough
4427664 hes always given me the impression hell stay but if he doesnt get in the big ones hell probably go around in the country cups races down there
4427665 we are relieved to be able to report that matts condition has improved and that he is now fully conscious
4427666 however he remains in intensive care and his recovery is expected to take several weeks
4427667 we have been so moved by the concern shown for matts safety and wellbeing both in china and australia
4427668 matt has had the very best medical care and our family is eternally grateful to matts team of doctors in beijing and hong kong 2gb the australian olympic committee the australian embassies both here and in beijing as well as sky channel
4427669 your combined efforts ensured that the severity of matts condition was identified early and that he received and is receiving appropriate treatment
4427670 this is one of the worlds deadliest viruses we know the percentage of recovered animals continue to carry the virus but we dont know what proportion that is
4427671 but we certainly know that it happens and there has been reappearances of the virus in that animal and that is a real risk
4427672 it was a tough decision but largely based on the opinion from the medical profession the risk to humans outweigh keeping the animal alive in the long term
4427673 the last two generations of his family were 100 per cent runners to winners
4427674 most children in some point in their lives fantasize about travel into space or becoming an astronaut
4427675 it seemed very natural that at the very least i would want to find a way to connect to the player community during my time in space
4427676 we will leave it as a permanent archive away from the potential disaster that might befall the surface of the earth
4427677 i think there is no question that they will enjoy it at many levels
4427678 we think the players will find it both fictionally really fitting as well as just from a practical standpoint the chance to get their own data sent into space
4427679 i have a very substantial load of commercial and research activity ive actually presold the results of a lot of the commercial work that i am doing in areas like protein crystal growth that is of use to pharmaceutical companies
4427680 thats how i spend my spare time adventuring into the reality in which we live

4427686 more and more we are seeing fashion brands getting involved in sports like the olympics or wimbledon or the us open
4427687 although interest may or may not be accompanied by overt physical action it is nonetheless associated with feeling animated and enlivened
4427688 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4427689 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4427690 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4427693 its quite possible h9n2 is infecting humans quite a lot much more than we appreciate merely because it is beyond the radar
4427694 in humans it is very mild so most of the time its probably not even recognised or biologically tested
4427695 its quite a silent virus its not highly pathogenic and sometimes it causes some morbidity in poultry but by and large it is just there and its unnoticed
4427696 there are other viruses out there besides h5n1 that could be the next pandemic
4427697 but i suspect h9n2 will not be so severe in its outcome

4427699 when i was little my dad belonged to the united auto workers union they went out on strike and he had to walk the picket line for six months
4427700 i hope that discussing the issue of human rights will have a positive effect
4427701 its good that human rights issues were raised by a high level leader
4427702 respect for democratic values human rights and civil liberties are prerequisites
4427703 it will be very frustrating if the agreement is ratified before there has been any progress on human rights
4427704 european countries only remember human rights when they have problems with the regime
4427705 the eu has no strategy to deal with human rights issues in syria
4427706 were doing our best but our ability to make an impact on this issue is limited
4427707 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
4427708 wrapped up in the dispute over russias attack on georgia is a moral argument between russia and the west that will shape the future of georgias breakaway territories

4427712 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4427713 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction

4427720 we have told the court we will announce within 45 days the new location of migron
4427721 the government caved in to settlers who threatened to use violence if they are evacuated while they illegally occupy private palestinian land
4427722 the thought of evacuating migron is against the torah and basic human morals
4427723 migron was erected in a fraudulent manner on private land taken from palestinians the same settlers who violated the law are now seeing their actions sanctioned by the law

4427726 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4427727 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem

4427734 we are saddled with the painful but most important task of handing over bakassi to cameroon we have commitments to the international community to promote peace and brotherliness between our countries
4427735 it is believed that if african leaders observe the rule of law the continent will be a more peaceful place
4427736 historic moment showing brotherly celebration of cooperation between the two countries
4427737 we in the un are happy about the handover what is important is that the handover is done at last
4427738 it has helped to douse tension generated by the ceremony
4427739 it is a wise decision and i think there must be good reason for it
4427740 after the handing over there will be buses and escort to convey you to the new bakassi for you to conduct interview
4427741 a good number of the senators were there at the national assembly when former president obasanjo and his cameroonian counter part were negotiating this issue why did they not shout only for this injunctive order to be issued at the wee hours of the day why didnt they tell the whole world their position then a good number of them were busy looking for a return to the national assembly

4427746 china is beginning to pull its weight on climate change
4427747 the targets and policies in place are in line with those being taken by leading countries like the uk and germany
4427748 many governments businesses and individuals have been wary of committing to action on climate change because they perceive that china the worlds largest emitter is doing little to address the issue however the reality is that chinas government is beginning to unleash a low carbon dragon which will power its future growth development and energy security objectives
4427749 before the 1980s people saw athletes as their own family

4427751 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4427752 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4427753 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4427754 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4427755 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4427777 i worked on setting up this portal and i am outraged that its being used inappropriately

4427779 the florida chamber believes a special legislative session is needed because taxpayers have an urgent need for property tax relief and taxpayer fairness
4427780 to create more jobs and opportunities for florida we must enact immediate solutions that make our tax system fair and sustainable
4427781 the effect of this amendment could impact our ability to recruit the businesses that will create high wage jobs for residents of this community as well as our efforts to attract a talented educated workforce

4427804 uhh you guys have nothing to worry about im a professional
4427805 ive heard rumors of being able to do it using coupons in the future
4427806 its a pain to do since i have to do them one at a time
4427807 but its still less than the cost of putting out a press release through a national news wire and its more personal so the response rate has been good so far
4427808 i got an apology from apple for the length of time it took to respond to me im very happy by this turn of events and im glad that apple will be letting me stay in the store
4427809 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4427810 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4427811 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4427812 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4427813 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4427814 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4427815 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4427816 its rush hour on a thursday night maybe theyll tune into the news or read the paper tomorrow and find out the facts on their own
4427817 something of this size shouldnt be a surprise to people whether theyre for it or against it everybody should know whats going on in their town
4427818 the issue for that one is the six story high rise condominium buildings right along the canal
4427819 i commend costello development for that it showed a willingness to compromise
4427820 i dont believe that a gated entrance is compatible with the character of the community
4427821 brighton has strong beautiful neighborhoods that are beautiful and welcoming this new residential development would meet a need for new homes and housing options without the gate it will become an asset for brighton

4427830 i was taking the precaution to protect myself how its interpreted thats always going to vary
4427831 there was no malicious intent there we were just trying to use everything given to us
4427832 being in my first olympics ive never been in this situation its a bit overwhelming to come in here
4427833 then by adding more attention on myself that put me a little more stressed out
4427834 its like a bad race we just have to put it behind us and refocus it was unfortunate i feel like were good now and ready to race
4427835 were not used to showing up to an event and having that many people there especially the media i feel like its behind us everything is positive now
4427836 i still do wear the mask when i feel necessary
4427837 today and yesterday since weve had the rain its been really nice i dont wear when i dont need it i still wear it when need be
4427838 i feel that because i have taken the precaution i feel healthy
4427839 the whole point of what were meaning to do by wearing the mask was to have the best performance i believe thats why i am still feeling good i feel like i am coming into just another race i havent had a problem ive been doing everything i need to do on every level i feel positive about everything and im ready to go
4427840 when my keirin is strong i know my sprint will be even stronger it just got me excited getting bronze in the sprint was a huge step for me
4427841 it got me really excited to come here with better form for the olympics
4427842 rebecca is one of my strongest competitors i have so much respect for rebecca
4427843 she is a second time olympian coming from rowing she has the experience from the games she has a great team behind here but i feel like i have a great team behind me too
4427844 our ability to get to the fire under the roof was problematic and it took some time
4427845 there was not a lot of active visible fire there was quite a bit of smoke for quite some time
4427846 in general there is a strong relationship between news websites linking out and getting links in return
4427847 if i may be so bold there was another president
4427848 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom

4427862 movie fans in australia and new zealand can choose from a great selection of over 700 films for purchase and rent on the itunes store
4427863 itunes provides an incredibly easy and fun way for people to discover and enjoy movies and has quickly become the worlds most popular online movie store with customers renting and purchasing over 50 000 movies everyday
4427864 one thing is for sure we have to keep an eye on this
4427865 because its there because it could develop into something stronger and if it follows what the models are saying it will be in our vicinity over the weekend
4427866 several of our guidance models would like to make it a hurricane

4427869 the iphone has changed the way people think about their mobile phones and we are delighted to help more customers get their hands on this revolutionary product
4427870 our best buy mobile employees have the training and expertise to deliver the best experience possible for our customers from the initial purchase through the life of their iphones
4427871 i was driving down folsom street in san francisco and i got a dropped call 10 times i get dropped calls just standing in one place
4427872 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
4427873 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4427874 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4427875 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4427876 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4427877 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4427878 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4427879 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4427880 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4427881 after looking at everything it looks like i had been there and just dont remember
4427882 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4427883 he was chairman of the commission overseeing the construction of the parkway he was a member of many civic board and civic organizations
4427884 when i was 12 and had crushes on guys id put my first name with their last name but it never sounded right

4427891 the network of muscles and tendons in the hand is very complicated

4427897 se soubesse que teria n o iria para a faculdade achava que ia ser s a brincadeira

4427909 its about getting in there and making your own dream come true
4427910 it was a good place to be mentally to think i would have a chance
4427911 when i was ahead of leisel i didnt really know what was going on
4427912 in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well any more it is becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4427913 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4427914 governing is more than not just being defeated in the house its also being able to pass legislation
4427915 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4427916 theyre killing women these people cant be afghans if my worst enemy my own personal enemy came into my hands but his wife was present i wouldnt touch him i would let him go
4427917 if we find out you used a tractor lent to you by the government we will burn it and kill you
4427918 may reflect the first move by drivers to boost fuel efficiency in response to higher prices
4427919 we may stink at the olympics but were world class when it comes to energy consumption
4427920 were trying to prove to ourselves and the league and everybody else that toronto is an nfl town as well as a cfl town theres room for both but theres certainly room for nfl games in toronto
4427921 the fact that this game will be a great success leads to the fact that tonight therell be more people in the stands for the argos than there would have been otherwise we think that a rising tide raises all boats
4427922 toronto is the fifth largest population centre in north america it stands to reason that theyre looking this way
4427923 if we can prove this experiment i think the contract of some games in buffalo and some games in toronto makes a lot of sense
4427924 therell always be fans in buffalo who say not toronto
4427925 if ralph wilson passes away none of this will make any difference anyway

4427941 tahun lalu saya selalu yakin jika mu yang melakukannya meraih gelar juara tapi kali tahun ini saya lebih memilih chelsea sebab tidak ada pergelaran piala afrika di bulan januari the blues punya sosok manajer baru luiz felipe scolari mereka pun membeli satu dua pemain berkualitas yang paling penting tahun lalu mereka nyaris meraih gelar tersebut
4427942 andaikata united mu berhasil merekrut sosok penyerang berkualitas top maka peluang mereka masih cukup besar tapi feeling saya sih tetap chelsea

4427954 xbox 360 has been an important partner in our efforts to offer consumers more ways to experience our artists music and this is especially true among gamers who are some of the most passionate music fans with this agreement we can take advantage of microsofts music platform and provide gamers what they want music videos from their favorite artists that can be downloaded quickly and easily

4427957 permanent joy for all of the little in ohio its the plan to steal ohio good grief
4427958 its a challenge to us to reach the level that we reached in auckland and maybe even surpass it
4427959 thats what great teams do consistently reach that level we dont doubt that this team has got the heart to do it but its a big challenge to take that intensity and level offshore and put it to work at newlands

4427964 the wii is a very cost effective platform to experiment with
4427965 there is a lot of crap coming out for the wii in general
4427966 if its not a good game it doesnt sell that flood of crap will die down as publishers become more coherent
4427967 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4427968 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4427969 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4427970 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4427971 i look forward to going to poland to sign that agreement soon
4427972 its important for the peace and security of the region its important for peace and security internationally
4427973 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4427974 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4427975 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4427976 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did

4427978 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4427979 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4427980 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4427981 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4427982 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4427983 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4427984 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4427985 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4427986 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4427987 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4427997 i was told that the article is meant to ask the people to pray for malaysians who are voting in permatang pauh and what decision they are going to make
4427998 i dont know the rest of the content so i think it will not be fair for me to comment
4427999 i have replied them and pointed out that the permit application form did not stipulate what constitutes religious articles
4428000 we also asked them what is their concept of religion because this is not defined in the permit conditions or the constitution
4428001 the article was an ethical analysis about the world after the sept 11 attacks on the world trade centre towers
4428002 should we not be mindful of how long weve lived in a particular place in the diaspora do we really have a choice when staying too long always means losing everything which we worked so hard to build up
4428003 once mashiach comes and evil has been completely eradicated then the light of god can increase daily for everyone and the pleasure of receiving it will be tremendous sadness depression and all unfortunate states of mind will never exist again

4428007 any team that is going to be successful needs to steer clear from suspensions and injuries and we didnt last season and thats why we struggled towards the end
4428008 weve lost a couple of players like david stockdale and tommy wright if bids come in like that then we have to look at them
4428009 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4428010 if i had to go through this i could at least be an example of trying to live out whats right trying to stand strong and trying to just keep my faith intact i stood strong because i believe in the truth
4428011 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god

4428017 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon
4428018 and every time we fixed the problem it duplicated itself
4428019 they are trying to come to a settlement before the sadc meeting tomorrow
4428020 they are already in south africa at the moment and they are discussing they are actually negotiating
4428021 we are travelling to south africa with president robert mugabe on friday as the negotiations continue
4428022 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later
4428023 you have tsvangirais backers who are playing hardball and insisting on the virtual disappearance of robert mugabe and youve got robert mugabes backers insisting he remains maintains some kind of executive powers
4428024 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate

4428035 but its a test im excited about and i believe it will go well
4428036 i felt we scrummed well in dunedin we have a tremendous amount of faith in gurthro and beast weve placed an emphasis on our scrumming and hopefully well see the results at the weekend
4428037 i definitely think the balance is better with richie mccaw back in the team he hits the ball hard and we will need to keep a special eye on him
4428038 but thats not to say jerome kaino and rodney sooialo wont be a handful i also believe adam thomson has had a good start to test rugby

4428052 if russia had an opportunity to react differently to georgias invasion of against south ossetia we would have grasped at it a state should react appropriately to a situation involving the killing of thousands of its citizens there was nothing else we could do any nation indeed the entire international community should give an appropriate and emphatic response to violations of international law not just pussyfoot around as is unfortunately often the case so we could not react differently and the developments of the five past days prove the reaction was most effective and consistent if we had failed to do what we did the number of deaths would have proved many times greater
4428053 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4428054 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4428055 juliana has such a mellow and sensuous voice you can imagine how overjoyed i felt after i called her up suggesting a duet and she agreed she compliments me and brings out the best in me

4428058 lovers of opera should not be worried that the opera would be performed in a foreign language since big screens would be available for translation
4428059 when i left for moscow my coach said to me at the airport remember when you are on the blocks the whole world is watching
4428060 not the best advice for a 14 year old my knees were shaking even during the warm up
4428061 i love culture which makes me wonder why i live in australia maybe barcelona was my favourite because i think i knew in my heart of hearts that it might be my last olympics so made the most of seeing more than the airport village and swimming pool
4428062 the games have changed enormously the villages now are full of things to do shops cinemas computer rooms etc and the food halls cater for all cultures with different areas for different types of food and are now big enough to cater for 10 000 athletes and the support staff
4428063 it seems to be so much more commercial now than ever and security measures are much more tough but rightly so athletes are more hungry to win now for financial bonuses from their own individual sponsors or in some countries the government bonuses which of course has increased the use of performance enhancing drugs that issue unfortunately cant be denied
4428064 i did some swimming early on at livingston road baths loved the fact that it was an odd length pool and very old coventry baths was always really tranquil in the mornings which was such a nice atmosphere to swim in
4428065 when i made the olympics for city of coventry in 1992 i was presented with my great britain tracksuit and your swimming coach also comes and stands on the rostrum
4428066 this was great but it had been such a long journey from 1980 to 1992 i wish all my coaches had been there as each and every one of them had contributed to my success
4428067 it means everything to me i was in new zealand working at the british amp irish lions tour when the announcement was made that the games would be in london watching a dodgy television with no sound
4428068 the sight of the brits jumping up and down with joy meant i didnt need the sound to tell me the outcome i decorated the british amp irish lions merchandise tent with balloons
4428069 currently i travel back from australia two to three times a year presenting in schools for the british olympic foundation fingers crossed the project will continue through until 2012 i am determined to be involved with the 2012 games in some way all offers considered
4428070 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain 22 if i am to go on living in the body this will mean fruitful labor for me yet what shall i choose i do not know 23 i am torn between the two i desire to depart and be with christ which is better by far 24 but it is more necessary for you that i remain in the body

4428079 deplor vel que num momento em que ainda devemos trabalhar sobre uma situa o muito complexa os estados unidos agravem ainda mais o estado das suas rela es com a russa
4428080 i have this problem in a bad way one moment ill have very strong 3g reception and in the next ill have dropped the signal and switched to edge i can barely keep a call from dropping on 3g and this is in san jose and san francisco metro not the back woods
4428081 honestly at this point im a lot happier just turning off 3g and running the thing on edge all the time battery life is much improved obviously without all the switching and most applications run at a reasonable speed most importantly calls dont drop
4428082 i really do hope i can use the 3g on my iphone 3g sometime soon though thats kinda why i bought it
4428083 its entirely possible that theres a huge problem with the chips the phones or the network
4428084 its also possible that the press is going to latch onto any problems with the iphone because writing the word iphone guarantees people read the article cell phone reception varies so i can only report on what im seeing i have used the iphone almost daily since i got it and have had bugs a lot of random slowness some minor app crashes and issues with the battery it dies before the end of the day and you cant carry a spare battery but ive had no problems with reception
4428085 it may have been a temporary glitch or volume overload
4428086 listening to your customers for a large corporation very important but why just for iphone users i am in possession of an htc diamond but say the direct counterpart of the iphone my range is dramatically bad
4428087 it is certainly not the iphone i have an mda vario iii and also has poor coverage in various places in the country
4428088 my main issue with all of this is apples complete and utter silence on the matter what would be the harm in acknowledging the issue and saying we will have a fix in short order it wouldnt hurt and most likely would garner apple more respect
4428089 wow those numbers are definitely impressive we all knew it was going to be successful but i doubt any of us would have predicted this
4428090 and this is with how shall i say a flood of less than stellar apps imagine how this store will do once it grows to include more useful applications
4428091 iinet is offering itunes content quota free which is great hopefully other isps will follow
4428092 my guess is that its not just apple its that the usage rules for online rentals are based on what the rights holders want and demand and what the infrastructure supports
4428093 theyre the type of people who move in at the end of an airport runway and say close the airport
4428094 i understand there are rules i can live with that but now the county is assaulting the very same people who cant park in front of their homes
4428095 they dont like to see us rednecks here were people too
4428096 why would i bother to plant flowers i might as well be in a campground
4428097 when it pulls up i literally feel the joy draining out of my body

4428100 no resuelve el embrollado y barroco tema de la carga tributaria para la paraestatal ni termina con la opacidad en el manejo de los recursos
4428101 quien tenga que pagar impuestos que los pague que sea equitativo y que todos carguemos con la parte que nos corresponda hay grandes empresas que le est n jugando chueco a este pa s as como organizaciones de actividades informales por no decir ilegales que ya suman cerca de 35 por ciento del producto interno bruto pib y no pagan un centavo de impuestos
4428102 la ley federal de derechos aplica a pemex impuestos de m s de 80 por ciento mientras a la miner a le pone un impuesto de unos pocos pesos por hect rea al semestre existe pues un sistema fiscal excesivo de un lado excesivamente oneroso y que lleva a la quiebra artificialmente a la empresa y del otro lado es excesivamente generosos con grandes empresas
4428103 los tramposos no tienen mucha ventaja estos resultados demuestran que les pisamos los talones

4428105 we are pleased to have received such a rapid review from the fda and look forward to addressing their comments promptly
4428106 our fda review team comprised of efp management and a number of expert fda consultants is gathering the information necessary to provide the fda with the information that it needs to proceed
4428107 we carefully evaluated oxford biomedicas present situation from a management scientific and equity prospective based on our analysis we decided to resubmit our previous rejected offer at a higher price per share we strongly believe that genethera may indeed be in the position by acquiring oxford biomedica to bring substantial value both to the companys scientific platform and to its shareholders
4428108 genetheras dna vaccine technology purivax is a highly efficient system designed to greatly improve dna vaccines application in clinic trials oxford biomedicas renal cancer clinical trial trovax was recently halted because of its failure to improve survival rate in the patients enrolled in the trial we believe that our purivax technology would be a critical factor in getting the trovax clinical trial restarted and possibly successfully completed i would like to also point out that the merging of the two companies would create a major player in the field of dna cancer vaccines the new company will also be in the position to meet the requirements for a listing on the amex or nasdaq giving genethera and oxford biomedica shareholders a greater advantage when compared to the present situation
4428109 sales for the quarter showed growth across all categories with our retail brands performing well
4428110 the instruments bring increased speed and efficiency to all my procedures at the same time giving me confidence in the hemostasis provided by the instruments they are an essential part of my practice
4428111 the fact that i can keep my focus on the operating field while activating and adjusting the power from the surgical field is a great safety feature
4428112 the second quarter of 2008 was a productive one for dor biopharma
4428113 we have now established named patient access programs for orbec in europe australia new zealand south korea singapore malaysia and south africa with more countries anticipated we have begun to receive orders for orbec treatments pursuant to these programs that will begin to generate revenue for us in the third quarter of 2008 we are also in the process of working with the fda on the protocol design for the upcoming confirmatory phase 3 clinical trial of orbec for the treatment of gi gvhd we believe that we will be able to initiate this trial during the fourth quarter of 2008 however additional funds will be required to fully execute this clinical program and others not presently covered by existing grants we continue to manage our cash burn very carefully while evaluating all strategic alternatives including potential orbec licensing deals and m amp a alternatives
4428114 ik ben in de loop van de dag tot de conclusie gekomen dat ik beter buiten het parlement kan vechten tegen het beeld dat nu over mij bestaat ik heb graag mijn handen vrij
4428115 the vice presidency is the most important decision that ill make before im president
4428116 you have to share the principles the values the goals but also the priorities
4428117 for years the joke was vp wasnt worth a bucket of warm spit
4428118 many young women are serving missions many are preparing to serve not because they arent married or have nothing else to do but because they have a desire to serve and therefore are being called to the work the reason so many are going is because in the next generation heavenly father will be sending his priesthood army to the earth and he wants to send them to mothers who have been properly trained and taught in the gospel and what better training can a young woman have than that of serving a mission
4428119 there seems to be growing in the church an idea that all young women as well as all young men should go on missions
4428120 i say what has been said before that missionary work is essentially a priesthood responsibility over a period of many years we have held the age level higher for young women in an effort to keep the number going relatively small again to the sisters i say that you will be as highly respected you will be considered as being as much in the line of duty your efforts will be as acceptable to the lord and to the church whether you go on a mission or do not go on a mission
4428121 yes this will be ok i can get over this or at least deal with it were perfect together i cant stand to think of losing him im sure ill enjoy intimacy in marriage
4428122 i cant go forward with this its not fair to him or me i deserve to love this aspect of a relationship when this escalates to marital intimacy it might be miserable for me for both of us
4428123 ive been struggling forever with whether im physically attract ed i think hes very cute and attract ive
4428124 you shouldnt care about that aspect of your relationship youre a girl
4428125 its rush hour on a thursday night maybe theyll tune into the news or read the paper tomorrow and find out the facts on their own
4428126 something of this size shouldnt be a surprise to people whether theyre for it or against it everybody should know whats going on in their town
4428127 the issue for that one is the six story high rise condominium buildings right along the canal
4428128 i commend costello development for that it showed a willingness to compromise
4428129 i dont believe that a gated entrance is compatible with the character of the community
4428130 brighton has strong beautiful neighborhoods that are beautiful and welcoming this new residential development would meet a need for new homes and housing options without the gate it will become an asset for brighton
4428131 one concern is what do they actually know hopefully they know more than what theyve indicated the other concern is why they deem this information not appropriate to give out
4428132 it is not a question that theres any need or attempt to hide anything due process is going on right now in thailand all the facts will come out in due process
4428133 somebody dies in mexico somebody dies here somebody dies there they dont care
4428134 last two days to see whats the hook at the bwac show august 16 amp 17
4428135 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4428136 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4428137 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4428138 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4428139 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4428140 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4428141 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4428142 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4428143 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4428144 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4428145 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4428146 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4428147 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4428148 these efforts include our initiatives to promote e governance and a national brand as well as establish the botswana government communications and information system bgcis
4428149 this is to ensure that government inter actively communicates information to the public in a timely authoritative coherent and coordinated manner in this way botswana should become better informed about itself and the world becomes well informed about botswana
4428150 an ongoing dialogue even between members of government between the public and their elected officials among the media and the subjects of their reporting is truly the hallmark of a vibrant democracy
4428151 they no longer have to wait for the morning paper you can even have the latest updates on world events beamed directly to your cellular phone in the midst of all this freedom of choice this cacophony of images and opinions how can we hope to focus our own thoughts enough to make sure our message is lucid and cogent
4428152 i was outraged to read that you want people to think this happened just one time with just one child
4428153 and that you say that the child violated boundaries and you were unable to stop him a 400 lb man unable to stop an eight year old child
4428154 social media companies are always going to have to be careful about the conversations that go on their networks
4428155 slander illegal acts and copyright issues are all potential risks since user generated content is by nature unpredictable
4428156 there are a number of laws out there that can be potentially violated on a social networking site
4428157 people have gotten nailed and lost their jobs when it has been discovered what they said on online industry forums
4428158 especially in the business networks the question becomes to what extent is your comment your own and to what extent does it represent the view of your employer
4428159 they write things online that they would never put on real paper
4428160 lori drew is definitely an exception however it is conceivable if someone posts derogatory pictures or writes something that could for example keep someone from getting a job or getting into college that they could be brought to court
4428161 michael has lots of potential he is real quality and could be a real legend at windsor park
4428162 the target is always to emulate or better what we have done from previous seasons

4428167 we had to do a few things to put pressure on the city and the state but our goal was to remain here in pittsburgh all the way those trips to kansas city and vegas and other cities was just to go and have a nice dinner and come back
4428168 whats happened is that the democrats are in a veto proof majority on council and theyre using that veto proof majority as a weapon including meeting in secret
4428169 we know that they met we know that they took a straw poll its an abuse of power
4428170 they went into the public meeting already agreeing to pass the drink tax referendum ordinance its important because the debate and discussion never sees the public light theyve already decided what theyre going to do
4428171 the reason for evaluating is to determine the effectiveness of a training program
4428172 i think its difficult for him to fix it because of the judgments hes made in the past and his lack of experience
4428173 if we are dissatisfied with obama as a potential president hillary cannot be expected to change our minds
4428174 theres an unbelievable camaraderie and yet in some cases we have nothing in common
4428175 there is an element of venting but also if you thought you were alone you were wrong
4428176 if this party turns its back on bill clinton its not a party that deserves our loyalty
4428177 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
4428178 hi everybody i hope that the denver convention will be turned into the american equivalent of tiananmen square
4428179 i started saying this was more than my candidate versus your candidate
4428180 if this guy wins that style of campaigning will become the de facto method
4428181 this evening at a thank you hillraisers event senator clinton told me how honored she is by the people who are working to have her name put into nomination and appreciative of those signing the petition

4428186 to retain flexibilitiy as violence declines in iraq without abandoning a central promise of his campaign that if elected he would end the war
4428187 the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability
4428188 it is true that in the past obama introduced the
4428189 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
4428190 his brazen invocation of the big lie to justify russias aggression accusing georgia of complete genocide against south ossetians provided an answer
4428191 the west will have to decide whether to continue its efforts to soothe and placate mr putin as if he were a petulant child who could be bought off with candy and words of praise or whether to rise to the geopolitical challenge his regime poses

4428208 what we need is britney spears to stay home instead of traipsing all over town that would solve the problem we dont need additional laws ive got laws coming out my ears to deal with this issue what you have is several young women in this town and several young men basically making fools of themselves and tying up not only my resources but the resources of the media that would do better covering legitimate stories instead of a bunch of airheads running around out there quite clearly some of these characters so favored by the paparazzi are clearly in need of services not police services but psychiatric services

4428212 left sided readers might not find the humor in this quote but that is the kind of attitude the book takes while exploring the reasons for the development of crime he does not feel sorry for the criminals themselves but for the people they are harassing in their debauchery it almost takes a negative tone throughout the book but does offer positive suggestions for corrections which bring about a certain balance another negative thing about the book is that it is very dated to put a positive spin on this the reader could say it made the book more interesting because you could judge for yourself whether his tips and predictions for the future were correct which for the most part they were although a little exaggerated and to be perfectly honest a lot of his arguments and points are still relevant in todays criminal world not a lot has changed in our justice system it would however be interesting to see an updated version of this book by the same other to see how he translated todays crime trends and statistics the way he did in this book sibermans closing remarks

4428216 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4428219 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4428220 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4428290 gosh my hoof is several feet in front of my leg itis
4428291 the win doesnt change too much really i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
4428292 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
4428293 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races and im really looking forward to that
4428294 you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff
4428295 its too early to say yet whether there will be opportunities to overtake around here but there are a couple of hairpins where it might be possible
4428296 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
4428297 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
4428298 thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4428299 im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula 1 can be and thats one of the reasons why its such a fascinating sport
4428300 clearly though i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim
4428301 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
4428302 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team in the city at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me
4428303 anyway going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
4428304 of course weve done some preparation back at the mclaren technology centre ahead of this race but our main focus will still be the three free practice sessions ahead of qualifying i enjoy visiting new racetracks and im looking forward to getting into the cockpit on friday morning it looks like being an amazing track
4428305 weve had pretty stable rules for the past few years and that is exactly what has happened
4428306 there are still those doing a better job but in the midfield group there are times when you have half a second from seventh to 20th its incredibly close
4428307 if you compare qualifying this year to last year across all the teams the average improvement is 0 2 seconds whereas were more like 1 4 seconds
4428308 mclaren and ferrari are still at the front but they are generally the teams that have made the least improvement so you would say those improvements are getting harder to find
4428309 my opinion is that next year it will be much more spread out because people will be getting used to the rules
4428310 it is significant and it would be nice to get it
4428311 team boss dietrich mateschitz is very keen on it and theres always pressure
4428312 if you can be friends with someone for twenty years it says much about your character it generally means youve learned how to forgive and be forgiven
4428313 we allow our users to find information about their potential legal claims and determine whether they are qualified for a particular claim without disclosing confidential information then our patent pending model pairs them with attorneys from their area who handle similar claims

4428318 general motors said thursday that it had essentially finished designing its first plug in hybrid car the chevrolet volt and would have production ready prototypes within 10 days the automaker still has considerable work to do on the cars lithium ion battery and other technology in the two years before the volt is scheduled to go on sale but completing the design is a milestone for what is arguably the most crucial car in decades for g m the volt would be able to travel at least 40 miles on battery power alone g m said the battery is recharged by plugging a cord into a household outlet

4428328 fate brought the two together its absolute romance in its purest form a fairy tale of a king and queen
4428329 only an impartial analysis of what happened would be able to prevent this kind of tragedy from recurring instead of reassuring the press the israeli military is fostering an unacceptable climate of fear and danger
4428330 if journalists are wearing flak jackets keeping a reasonable distance from the belligerents and clearly displaying press markings there should be a change in the behaviour of the soldiers in areas where civilians including journalists are present
4428331 two persons were spotted leaving the vehicle carrying a large black object the black object was placed on a tripod above a dirt mound and directed at the tank the tank crew reported the spotting to its superiors the latter authorized firing a tank shell at the characters in light of the genuine suspicion that the object mounted on the tripod and directed at the tank was an anti tank missile or mortar a suspicion consistent with the characteristics of that days hostilities

4428334 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4428335 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4428336 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4428337 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4428338 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4428339 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4428340 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4428341 is doing quite well in terms of the economic fundamentals

4428343 we geloven in de kracht van de navo en de eu
4428344 maar we weten ook hoeveel tijd het kost om die machine in beweging te brengen we willen deel uitmaken van een bondgenootschap dat in een eventueel conflict vanaf het eerste uur in actie komt en niet pas als er alleen nog dode mensen te redden vallen

4428346 if it be asked what is to restrain the house of representatives from making legal discriminations in favor of themselves and a particular class of the society i answer the genius of the whole system the nature of just and constitutional laws and above all the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates the people of america a spirit which nourishes freedom and in return is nourished by it
4428347 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4428348 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4428349 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4428350 down by an average of 1 37 per barrel per session
4428351 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4428352 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil

4428361 have you got any paper and envelope i want to write a letter
4428362 i dont like carrying my beautiful old clock in their truck
4428363 youre stupid why dont buy a watch as other people
4428364 i would like to know if anyone has seen a rip in the clouds as it was taking place
4428365 a true person of science would step forward and lay all questions to rest
4428366 it is safe to assume that peoples claims must have basis
4428367 id like nothing more than for someone to prove nothing is going on
4428368 you are by far not only a fraud but a coward as well
4428369 global warming is just a myth started by our duplicitous governments as a means of extracting additional taxes
4428370 any human government is the work of the devil and no good will come of it and there is no more to think about
4428371 cia publically admits in its pdf document it spys on americans
4428372 if there was a layer of humidity the trail would not form
4428373 they only form above 30 000 feet or so where the humidity is low
4428374 a metallic salt can extract moisture from 30 40 humidity instead of the 70 for normal cloud formation
4428375 trails should form and dissipate or not form at all
4428376 although chemtrails are conspicuous in our skies and thousands of sites exist about the menace the mainstream media and the authorities are very quiet about the matter or ignore and deny their existence this of course adds fuel to the conspiracy theories but its not just the media and the officials that are silent because there is a similar wall of silence from successful singer songwriters and rock stars as well as celebrities in general what does this mean is there some memo that gets circulated warning that if you mention chemtrails your contract is terminated are people too scared to mention such stuff in public what is going on i say we need people who can get the media exposure to come forward on this matter we need stars to talk about chemtrails on live tv and radio i believe we need protest songs about chemtrails if anyone knows of any please let me know
4428377 i totally disagree please do some research tony i have been researching this for a long time the planet is being geoengineered under caps amp trade schemes there are many things being done including weather modification which i have seen in the uk and here and is all known about if you dig deep try californiaskywatch com for starters
4428378 you can watch trails that last and spread and no trails or old style contraisl at the same time you can watch planes with no trail start a trail and then stop you can have a day or period of a day with old style normal clouds and blue sky followed by loads of chemtrails and a sky turned to a mass of fake clouds and haze
4428379 you can have a day or period of a day with old style normal clouds and blue sky
4428380 listen tony i dont see why you feel the need to insult me
4428381 i didnt start this argument and if you have nothing fucking better to do with your time fuck off
4428382 i know what i see and have the opinions of thousands of others who see likewise
4428383 i certainly dont need to be insulted by somone i thought was a friend
4428384 scientific evidence proves that a great increase of planes cannot affect the upper stratosphere
4428385 youre implying that air layers combine suitably within an hour
4428386 50s 60s and 70s disseminated all over britain millions of ppl affected
4428387 disseminated on one occasion from a boat moored five miles out from a south eastern fishing port
4428388 targeting these areas get the full benefit of the poisons
4428389 namely they persist for hours eventually turning into a haze that doesnt go away
4428390 they stop and start in a manner not consistent with normal contrail formation
4428391 just swipe your finger on random sufaces and hold up to sun and see the metal particals
4428392 antagonistic to empire super state comprising pentagon blah nasa why do you think population culling is off the table
4428393 why not read history as if you were not immune to it
4428394 what about alleged contrails under 8km where the temp is warmer than 40
4428395 what about the orbs that have been observed in and around the trails
4428396 what about sudden noticeable increases in flyovers trails in areas where there are few if any major flight paths
4428397 very attached to being right and superior to those lesser mortals
4428398 hard for him to let go of what he knows

4428401 there have been tests aluminium fluorescent particles zinc cadmium sulphide e coli bacillus globigii it mimics anthrax serratia marcescens bacteria phenol
4428402 white c 130 are often observed around legitimate chem trail reports
4428403 its not fairly harmless when its 7 times higher than safety limits and your inhaling it
4428404 so why has anthrax been found in the air when chemtrails are being dispersed if its not in the air when vapour trails have been seen
4428405 allowing yourself to be a vessel for spreading deception is wrong whether or not you are doing it intentionally or out of ignorance
4428406 no one today can possibly view that circus we call the
4428407 you will then have your answer as to who are the perpetrators
4428408 by the way you appear to take things very personally
4428409 it tells all of us here that you and your
4428410 i urge people to raise their heads and do their homework
4428411 if you try to pin these people down and refute things its well youre just part of the conspiracy
4428412 logic is not exactly a real selling point for most of them
4428413 these things are at 30 000 to 40 000 feet in the atmosphere theyre tiny particles of ice theyre not going to affect anyone
4428414 the importance of the diurnal and annual cycle of air traffic for contrail radiative forcing
4428415 contrails form at a wing span distance from bottom of plane
4428416 same time try to explain their day long endurance spreading claiming the higher levels have uniform saturation
4428417 this cartilage gel that arts plugging could be used for the joint ache that chemtrail victims complained about last night say wait a minute maybe chemtrails were deployed to boost cartilage gel sales
4428418 monday a khou crew met with chemtrail tracking usa club co founders lorie kramer and dona of houston and member rhonda from ft worth as well as other local members of the yahoo based club for the taping of a story on chemtrails and public concern over their purpose and health impact reporter ron travino and cameraman nathan visited for several hours at the house of lorie taping talking asking questions and viewing photos and videos
4428419 grace valerian recognized that the power of suggestion worked against his claim and proposed coining a new term more suggestive of his claim

4428422 since when do they make soda pop from burnt methanol
4428423 more than those 1500 volcanoes would weigh as a whole
4428424 they do not produce 300 million tones of deadly gas per annum but aircraft do
4428425 so really it is about faith rather than debating the real evidence
4428426 way too high amounts of heavy metals in eu food liver cancer
4428427 since not enough moisture to keep contrail present at high altitudes disappears within a minute
4428428 if you really had a clue when it came to science then you wouldnt be posting this crap
4428429 so the proof is what comes out of your mouth you are an evil person for promoting what the government is doing to its citizens and you should be tried just like the nazis were in the nuremberg trials for the atrocities you and others like you are trying to cover up
4428430 i live near a v large airport and have seen what goes on
4428431 why many jets laying persistent contrails would converge in time and space 100 miles from any large airport
4428432 strangely concentrated and patterned jet trails through or over which other jets can pass with normal contrail dissipation
4428433 i will not go out to see them because my asthma is terrible

4428437 attempt to make rational people who are making observations and discussing their experiences appear to be conspiracy nuts and or uneducated
4428438 you are using faulty logic and classic emotion based redirection example
4428439 these are exactly the tactics that are used to manipulate rather than uncover the truth
4428440 you should know that your posts are smacking of someone with an agenda
4428441 you were the one to put forward a theory for what they are
4428442 in additional you brought up the subject of evil no one else here did

4428449 the combination of pollens auto fumes and urban smog can cause severe auto immune failure asthma and death in the young weak or elderly
4428450 i want to thank you dear boy i have been wrong these past fifteen years
4428451 there is a principle which is a bar against all information which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation
4428452 i have paid attention to weather my entire life studied it in college and am a storm spotter
4428453 samples have been collected from rain and snow throughout america
4428454 normal commercial craft a lot higher not leaving much of a contrail even while others leave the thick noduled classic chem trail
4428455 commercial aircraft fly at 30 35k feet the chems usually sprayed at 12 15k feet
4428456 im not convinced chemtrails are contrails i suspect that people like jazzroc are paid disinformation agents because of their methods and misleading tactics i could be totally wrong and it would be wonderful if chemtrails didnt exist but from my personal experience and from hearing other people talk makes me think otherwise what do you think please post an intelligent comment about what you think of jazzroc and others like him and not just an insult silentkill666 ge109bengineer if you suspect other profiles he is using please post it in the comments or message me
4428457 pigs vietnam new respiratory illness and then theres the bird flu
4428458 spraying seems to be higher during certain parts of the year is there anything to this
4428459 suffering from chronic pain syndrome fibromyalgia like symptoms but other than some arthritis and mild disc herniations
4428460 i wonder if this is caused by what is going on in the sky
4428461 difficult to believe time chemtrail videos comments denial of thier existence
4428462 i watched blue sky outter banks turn mass of cirrus like clouds emit from planes
4428463 stayed hours passing out of site followed same cloud upwind happens every day all year
4428464 a sticky yellow surface on ground strange web like thread
4428465 epa continously negate the need to investigate do not give any reasons
4428466 cloud is 550ton of weight while the contrails can be bigger then most clouds
4428467 one of the biggest planes boeing 747 can carry 250tons
4428468 for 30 years of my life i have never seen
4428469 if you can get a sample of rain on that day and compare it with samples of rain from other days without trails and if your results show a difference then you are very close to knowing other than guessing
4428470 what would you do tony if you were the head of number one environmental policing agency and citizens asked you about planes spraying chemicals in the air i am sure you would investigate not just ignore
4428471 one year later in 2000 epa received a physical sample of highly unusual airborne fibrous material
4428472 we are unaware of any programs to disperse materials into the atmosphere
4428473 a white plane from 5 8 miles looks different then half white half blue plane from 5 8 miles
4428474 to prove whether these could be left by shuttle flights we need an opinion of an expert pilot or a radar operator i am neither but these seems highly unlikely to me to be left by shuttles
4428475 tell me what you think about an idea to sent a balloon into a trail like that and gathering a sample
4428476 retards helping disguise cover evil youll get yours your foolishness lead people astray your suffering complete traitors to your own kind no stopping the nwo crafting this for centuries very powerful entities toward our destruction happy ending lot of suffering evil will have its hour light will prevail
4428477 look at the way the towers collapsed vertically jet fuel wouldnt generate enough to heat to melt steel only controlled explosions can do that
4428478 the mistaken belief that a handful of unexplained anomalies can undermine a well established theory lies at the heart of all conspiratorial thinking as well as creationism holocaust denial and the various crank theories of physics
4428479 was impersonated by an actor from 1975 to 1978 that new evidence about the loch ness monster had emerged plus a link to loose change
4428480 the main thing necessary for these to form is when the temperature and dew point are within 5 degrees
4428481 checking the upper air data will give insight to conditions
4428482 unwilling to put your status as a person of knowledge on this issue
4428483 you have not been criticized yet your replies are repeatedly childish
4428484 you must dance because you sure dance around the issue
4428485 you more afraid to find out there is something than i am to find out there isnt
4428486 no scientist is willing to use science to prove once and for all what is in the trails
4428487 you sit back and take part by numerous useless posts
4428488 the key in my opinion is not holding 100 certainty i e belief in anything because it simply violates the mathematical conservation of probability youll have to forgive my initial reaction the government under which i live has a well documented history of using disinformation agents to dilute the effectiveness of movements in the case of chemtrails the thing that gives it such traction including in my own psyche originally is that it plays off isomorphic circumstances the use of depleted uranium in iraq the general pollution of our community the proliferation of wireless and cellphone radiation while having an implicit base of data the problem as you describe is in that inference knowing that relative humidity can be stratified through different levels of the atmosphere causes all that data to be inferred a bit more plainly
4428489 in contrast to almost all of the other you tube haters and bots
4428490 im having a real hard time sorting out the bullshit from the authentic conspiracies
4428491 ive barely seen some of the videos on chem trails but it seems as if there is not any proof by anyone
4428492 im from norway myself its nice i guess those dark winter days the booze not a lot of people though 4 7 million
4428493 new world order pumping chemicals down on our damn heads
4428494 look at the luggage drawers on the right side in the photo
4428495 hi jazzroc please man think with me for just a second
4428496 if these are contrails then why are they not coming from the engines
4428497 some are indeed contrails but lots of them are not
4428498 in the uk its mainly used to create the depressing uniform dull grey sky which has now become accepted as standard british weather
4428499 28 secs into it did you catch a plasma em field
4428500 no stratus or cirrus cloud formations without the help of the synthetic plasma field
4428501 ultrafine powders amp transparent liquids of multi layered metallic silica oxides varieties bacteria and chemicals to create different catalysts for different cryptography effects
4428502 ive seen chemtrails here in new zealand amp the exact same thing happens with the weather what are they doing
4428503 a contrail will remain visible for longer with different humidity and temperature but thinning and creating cloud cover
4428504 supersaturated air thickens the trail so much it falls as pendules
4428505 read the patent holders comments about the multiple uses of h a a r p
4428506 its used to heat a line of sight area of the ionosphere
4428507 boron hydride nitromethane pfft a few fast fighters solid additives to fuels would be really dangerous to the planes liquid additives couldnt include aluminum or barium for various technical reasons blood products are a joke surely
4428508 every one of them so far out of context as to be a lie
4428509 i do not deny alot of the footage and discussion on the net is ill informed and plain wrong
4428510 it is not as simple as you try to write it off as in your videos and comments
4428511 oh yes it is my videos are musical shows how hard you research
4428512 and a final note your formula is for carbonated water not soda pop
4428513 haha true but a damned sight closer than any chemtrail statement
4428514 the combination of pollens auto fumes and urban smog can cause severe auto immune failure asthma and death in the young weak or elderly
4428515 faa tells contrails appear a wing span distance from back
4428516 the avg temp easily estimated even from ground temp measurement
4428517 ground temp of 30 c or more it is hardly likely that a plane flying low enough 2 be visible by the naked eye could produce a normal contrail
4428518 you apparently did work for the government making your motives questionable
4428519 its a lie to cover up the real motives at work here
4428520 they only want to treat the symptom not the cause
4428521 all u do is debunk the word chemtrail nothing else
4428522 random videos in your channel 2 make it look as though your an average guy
4428523 you have just started doing that as people became suspicious
4428524 ive talked to many older ppl amp none remember seeing these
4428525 100s of chemtrail photos from a one hour period in my local sky
4428526 i have a hard time believing our own people would do this to us
4428527 he believes he will not be judged but he will have his part in the lake of fire
4428528 idiots who dont know difference contrail chemtrail screw off hilton video
4428529 have not yet woken up care about their lives and their loved ones
4428530 lol well youre nuts but at least you concede that theres something up there that shouldnt be we get lots of these over toronto as well 100 chemicals including berium very poisonous also weather maniuplation
4428531 i have seen these same posts of yours on other chemtrail videos
4428532 how do you respond to dr deagles video response above
4428533 do some fuels pollute more than others or is it only the onion theory that makes or breaks contrails
4428534 why is there proof that these trails contain heavy metals anthrax zinc amp other nasties
4428535 contrails can remain visible for very long periods of time with the lifetime a function of the temperature humidity winds and aircraft exhaust characteristics
4428536 observation and scientific analysis of contrails and their duration date back to at least 1953
4428537 air turbulence created by the passage of other aircraft differences in wind speed along the flight track and possibly through effects of solar heating
4428538 contrail formation depends on the relative humidity of the atmosphere the ratio of what is to what could be at a particular temperature
4428539 if you try to pin these people down and refute things its well youre just part of the conspiracy logic is not exactly a real selling point for most of them the cloud forming contrails that conspiracy theorists find so ominous are perfectly natural
4428540 the variation in presentation is explained by the tropospheric conditions and to some extent the positioning of aircraft engines when the troposphere experiences a relatively stable supersaturated condition water vapor in excess of 100 humidity without condensation then any disturbance that causes formation of ice crystals provides nucleation surfaces for the supersaturated moisture to condense upon when a jet engine burns its fuel the major byproduct is water vapor when the exhaust passes over the rear stabilizer of an aircraft the tips or ends of the stabilizer cause the exhaust to expand rapidly when it does the temperature decreases rapidly within a turbulent flow and ice crystal formation is forced generally this makes it look as if the jet were spraying a cloud from the ends of the stabilizer if the atmosphere is not at saturation the contrail will not persist the formed ice crystals will sublimate into the surrounding atmosphere hence the appearance of a short well formed vapor trail if the water content is very low then no discernible contrail will form at all all the exhaust water will be absorbed by the atmosphere before there is time to form ice crystals
4428541 if the atmospheric water content is not consistent with altitude picture atmospheric
4428542 one other phenomenon observed is the formation of contrails off wing surfaces along with the engine exhaust contrails this can be caused when the air is highly supersaturated and the expansion of the air coming off of the wing surface is sufficient to cause ice crystallization in this case it appears that the whole plane is leaving a trail this can often be observed by a passenger flying in a commercial airplane when entering cold supersaturated air particularly in the winter when close to a storm front
4428543 there were no pictures or evidence that indicated anything other than the above contrail formation phenomena
4428544 i get ill i feel nauseous and get disoriented from them
4428545 other jets fly close in altitude and areas with rapidly dissipating trails
4428546 other trails spread into a web covering the entire sky from an operation
4428547 we would still think the world was flat if we listened to your method of reasoning
4428548 everyone should be questioning and exploring whats going on unless of course you have an agenda to obfuscate the truth
4428549 its counter productive to denounce peoples ideas on the basis that you condescendingly i might add believe they are unsure or uneducated
4428550 in my mind there has not yet been a convincing explanation as to what the chemtrails are
4428551 you are suggesting that it is evil to explore any theory unless you are sure its true
4428552 you are also implying that since you are sure of your explanation
4428553 that reasoning goes against the advancement of science and progress
4428554 they are scared to death of the people becoming united in one mindset and purpose
4428555 this is why they send people like jazzroc to make noise and try and sow confusion
4428556 but just laugh at people like jazzroc and send them on their way
4428557 it is stratified in temperature with warmer layers higher up and cooler layers farther down which makes the stratosphere dynamically stable
4428558 horizontal mixing of gases components proceeds much more rapidly than vertical mixing
4428559 the qbo induces a secondary circulation that is important for the global stratospheric transport of tracers such as ozone or water vapor
4428560 because there is no science that backs up your bogus claim
4428561 you have chosen to lie continously about the ongoing chemtrail spray program
4428562 they dont have to use the engines to spread it
4428563 how could steam last for hours up in the freezing cold
4428564 ever seen steam last for hours on a cold day no duh
4428565 what the heck does the stratosphere and troposphere have to do with what i said at all
4428566 grade 4 science so you dont have to explain the whole unit over again thanks
4428567 then his information is from the information circles that he would encounter in that environment
4428568 they have re educated those in the field he lives on the field so what do you expect
4428569 i wonder for instance he thinks depleted uranium is a harmless substance that can be left on a battlefield without causing harm to future generations
4428570 hes not necessarily paid to do what hes doing it may just be a function of what his being has been taught in that environment
4428571 his argument must be right after all hes all into guarding the most powerful country on the planet and he grew up there how could the information he has be wrong eh
4428572 they are doing it now as many people are realising
4428573 in a world of universal deceit the truth is a revolutionary act
4428574 32 c 39 humidity clear sky its a rarity to get a normal short breath contrail but we get grids that expand all day long and cover the entire sky as cloud cover
4428575 6 separate trails ensuing from 4 or 2 engine planes
4428576 havent my grandfather or father seen these before only in the last few years
4428577 you seem to have a answer or cover up 4 everything
4428578 a few chemtrails get sprayed amp a few hours later its overcast again
4428579 when vapor is in the exposed to the sun it vanishes rather quickly
4428580 the closest thing to a water vapor haze is fog
4428581 notice how fog burns away when the sun comes out
4428582 so theres a very high probability that its not water vapor
4428583 contrails do not last for hours because the heat from jet exhaust is what creates the condensation
4428584 if chemtrails were not a covert operation we would hear propaganda just like we do with flouride in the water supply
4428585 for the feeble minded but you wont find many here
4428586 subverting and perverting something that belongs to the most powerful
4428587 your god lucifer is a lier imposter and a theif
4428588 he lacks the intellect goes along with what hes told
4428589 some of us just want to know what is going on
4428590 patterns form clouds shown right along side regular cumulus clouds
4428591 v pattern spread out like growing crystals contrail splits in three
4428592 if these are just contrails that form only under very specific conditions
4428593 why do these chemtrails always persist for hours when contrails only last seconds
4428594 also in the below clip you can clearly see the planes turning the
4428595 and lastly the trail does not come out of the engine it comes out of slots in the wings and trails clearly not out of the engine
4428596 if the atmospheric water content is not consistent with altitude picture atmospheric
4428597 one other phenomenon observed is the formation of contrails off wing surfaces along with the engine exhaust contrails this can be caused when the air is highly supersaturated and the expansion of the air coming off of the wing surface is sufficient to cause ice crystallization in this case it appears that the whole plane is leaving a trail this can often be observed by a passenger flying in a commercial airplane when entering cold supersaturated air particularly in the winter when close to a storm front
4428598 also the center fuel tank huge amount of chemicals unless you fly overseas
4428599 you can simply rig that up to the fuel dump lines and a chemtrail is born
4428600 i wouldnt trust contrailscience as i dont know source of webpage
4428601 passenger planes wouldnt fly so close together and crisscross each other
4428602 massive amount of anti conspiracy theory commentry thats been posted in the last few months
4428603 we know where airports are amp where commuter jets are headed
4428604 jets dont turn at 30 000 ft already on course
4428605 dont want us to believe we are being poisoned that bad

4428617 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4428618 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4428619 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4428620 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year

4428683 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year

4428694 show they can handle the pressure its not something gained being on a radio show
4428695 so what did you do last night the economics of infidelity
4428696 men dont seem to consider the costs of infidelity like women do its somewhat consistent with what you sort of anecdotally see with male behavior they appear to take on what to an outsider seems like huge risks it seems to be consistent with what we find males like generally
4428697 women are going to be cheating largely to gain genetic advantages
4428698 men are more likely to cheat from a biological standpoint in order to ensure that their genes get passed on and so the more women the better the probability holding everything else constant men and women both have biological tendencies but the way those tendencies show themselves are going to be different
4428699 i think a lot of times infidelity is more of a symptom of a bad marriage than the sole cause of a breakdown
4428700 usually theres poor communication or financial problems and people are more apt to cheat under those circumstances than a marriage that was more solid
4428701 were all people we all still make errors and make bad mistakes
4428702 its a fascinating sociology aspect how people look at that and view that

4428707 so if you stick to some of the traditional things youre probably capturing that 60 percent but not the 40 percent
4428708 if youre in a hot market it may not matter in this market you need to look at the 100 percent

4428733 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4428734 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make

4428787 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4428788 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4428789 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4428790 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4428791 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4428792 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4428793 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4428794 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air

4428796 a few days ago french president nicolas sarkozy got agreement on the six points from the russians and then from the georgians
4428797 and there was agreement on these points as a set of principles it now needs to be a formal ceasefire and thats what were working on
4428798 im going to now talk to president saakashvili about the clarifications that the french have provided
4428799 and then well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap as soon as possible
4428800 this success underlines the robust health of the equity release sector despite the impact of the credit crunch that is having such a negative effect on the mainstream mortgage market it also serves to highlight the distinctly different forces that drive the equity release market relative to the mainstream market including the fundamental pressures of the uks ageing population falling levels of pension contributions and the very high levels of personal wealth held in housing equity
4428801 despite the current fall in property prices the very big increases of the past mean that typically by far the biggest asset held by people later in life is equity in their home this latest rise in volumes may have been influenced by people wanting to accelerate their plans to release equity for fear of property prices falling further over time or it may have been simply the increasing pressure on finances cause by rising prices that are often felt hardest by those in or nearing retirement
4428802 even though mortgage sales have been slower we need to recognise that many of our customers are savings customers and we need to offer them a range of protection products to meet their needs
4428803 with mortgage business not so vibrant we are having to look at all of our customers to determine whether they need cover or not and if they do then we will provide it for them

4428898 are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them is forgotten before god but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
4428899 consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap which neither have storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much more are ye better than the fowls and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the rest consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these if then god so clothe the grass which is to day in the field and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you o ye of little faith and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
4428900 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him
4428901 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord
4428902 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him

4429026 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november

4429028 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4429029 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4429030 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4429031 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4429032 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4429033 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4429034 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4429035 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4429036 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4429037 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4429038 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4429039 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4429040 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4429041 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4429042 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4429043 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4429044 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4429045 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4429046 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4429047 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4429048 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4429049 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4429050 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4429051 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4429052 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4429053 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4429054 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4429055 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4429056 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4429057 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4429058 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4429059 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4429060 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4429061 who are open to doing something on the production side
4429062 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4429063 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4429064 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4429065 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4429066 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4429067 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4429068 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4429069 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4429070 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4429071 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4429072 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4429073 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4429074 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4429075 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4429076 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4429077 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4429078 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4429079 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4429080 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4429081 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4429082 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4429083 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4429084 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4429085 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4429086 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4429087 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4429088 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4429089 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4429090 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4429091 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4429092 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4429093 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4429094 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4429095 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4429096 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4429097 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4429098 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4429099 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4429100 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4429101 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4429102 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4429103 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4429104 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4429105 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4429106 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4429107 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4429108 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4429109 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4429110 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4429111 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4429112 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4429113 we have not yet found it necessary to make stewardship a part of our preaching or teaching curriculum because up to now we have had no financial worries god has always met our need

4429116 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4429117 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take

4429123 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4429124 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4429125 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4429126 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide

4429170 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4429171 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4429172 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4429173 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4429174 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem

4429178 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4429179 often don revealing blouses and always have makeup jobs fresh out of a beauty salon
4429180 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4429181 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4429182 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4429183 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make

4429248 i mentioned it to a few other people and they were really keen and it just sort of grew from there

4429275 if we cant get the matching funds then the money from the claims conference goes to other states
4429276 it is a nice program and it is important to have the kids break bread with the survivors

4429289 i would just say the family believes its a shame if the belarusian government takes any actions against existing or future programs for young children based on the decision of one girl

4429674 in de tussentijd vragen wij klanten die een storing ervaren als gevolg van het invoeren van hdcp contact met ons op te nemen wij adviseren hen tegelijkertijd contact op te nemen met de producent van de televisie
4429675 bij opnieuw invoeren van de software kan de tv weer op zwart gaan dat kan aan de tv liggen als die hdcp niet ondersteunt moet de eigenaar bij de producent zijn
4429676 de reden waarom we hdcp invoeren is omdat contractuele afspraken met de hd content providers studios en zenders ons hiertoe dwingen met de invoering van hdcp verzekert upc zich van blijvende doorgifte van hd zenders tot op heden voerde upc geen hdcp
4429677 een aantal partijen dit van ons eist in eerdere contracten was dit ook opgenomen

4429679 i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china open up further and reform better
4429680 i think china has been stepping forward and if you ask the ordinary chinese on the streets they will give you the same answer
4429681 everybody is happy people are optimistic about their own future that is a fact
4429682 that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4429683 people will see better for themselves what china is like
4429684 the gunning down of three female foreign aid workers two of them canadians and their afghan driver a few dozen miles south of kabul on wednesday is the latest bloody murder to underscore the relentless deterioration in afghan security conditions
4429685 here in beleaguered kandahar where i have lived for nearly seven years and currently run a small soap making co operative what most distressed my co op members was the gender of the victims
4429686 theyre killing women these people cant be afghans if my worst enemy my own personal enemy came into my hands but his wife was present i wouldnt touch him i would let him go
4429687 western coverage has brought to light other areas however where afghan and international perceptions of this tragedy diverge
4429688 this conflict however is different from most countries where international aid agences operate
4429689 neither the forces fighting the afghan government nor ordinary people make any distinction between international humanitarian workers the afghan government and international military forces all are seen as part of the same system
4429690 the vast majority of regular folk desire the presence of these interlocking groups
4429691 but the most important constraint on aid work is the risk it poses to afghans many villages in kandahar have been refusing development assistance for several years now they are afraid that the mere acceptance of these projects will transform their homes into targets
4429692 the afghans do not support this so called insurgency they are its primary targets
4429693 there was certainly some hope and aspirations made in 2001 to have the games have a positive impact on the wider social framework and i think we have to note that there have been enormous steps forward in numbers of areas
4429694 youre here to report on the games the world is watching and there will be commentaries made appraising how the games have had an impact to bring sports athletes and the worlds attention
4429695 we are very proud of the fact that these games are progressing with spectacular sports spectacular sports venues operationally running smoothly and thats what were here for
4429696 were very pleased with how the organizers are putting on a good sports event
4429697 thats what this is this is an event first and foremost for the athlete and the athletes are giving extremely positive feedback about how they see these games being held
4429698 i was confronted with many questions about the opening up and the reform of china and i did say that the olympic games coming to china would help china open up and reform better and the effects show
4429699 after 30 years of reform china is developing quickly people enjoy more freedom and they have a lot to say and the welfare of people has improved a lot
4429700 people are so friendly people are living a good life everybody is happy people are optimistic about their future
4429701 peek and be critical to dig into details and find fault with that
4429702 i did not say that china would promise to do whatever with the games in china
4429703 but i said that the games will open up the horizon about china
4429704 people will see better for themselves what china is like
4429705 if you want to come over here and you want to be critical its alright

4429710 one of the refrains have you ever been hit in the head with a blackberry by foxy brown well then you aint hip hop
4429711 our simulations suggest well employ a downforce level similar to that of hockenheim
4429712 but the individual demands of the track may push that window up or down
4429713 the most important thing is to be thorough methodical and iterative
4429714 although we arrive at a new racetrack having undertaken a huge amount of research and armed with an enormous amount of data the reality is that its really only the starting point for our engineering team
4429715 we begin friday practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car
4429716 the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital that you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying
4429717 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be both green and dusty on the opening day of practice
4429718 that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car
4429719 finally anybody whos studied any onboard footage of the circuit will be mindful of the proximity of the concrete barriers in certain areas clearly well be packing plenty of spares but hoping we wont need to use them
4429720 i think they followed the coaches leads i really do we were determined to go out with there with energy ourselves and the team followed

4429836 these special fish are very valuable as they bring social economic and environmental benefits to local communities their sensitivity and need for a good quality environment means we need to work together with our partners to address the complex factors affecting them
4429837 the salmon and trout association very much welcomes the environment agencys new strategy especially the inclusion of sea trout we have been consulted at all stages during the evolution of the strategy which is an excellent example of the environment agency involving partners in a major project

4429840 while a degree in computer science for example will show a commitment to the subject and a high level of technical knowledge it may not differentiate an individual in a market that demands current and relevant skills
4429841 public sector organisations often require degree educated candidates but to succeed in private enterprise individuals are still likely to need an industry recognised qualification even in addition to their academic achievements it is the ability to communicate with customers to solve problems and to understand business needs that will set you apart these skills are fundamental whether you enter the workplace at 16 after a levels or with a degree and there are opportunities at all levels
