4650000 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4650001 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia is controlling the central asian republics
4650002 what is the world to make of russias invasion of georgia
4650003 fundamentally at stake is what kind of role russia will play in the new international system
4650004 the question the international community now confronts is how to respond to a russia that engages in the blatant use of force with larger imperial designs in mind to reintegrate the former soviet space under the kremlins control and to cut western access to the caspian sea and central asia by gaining control over the baku ceyhan pipeline that runs through georgia
4650005 in brief the stakes are very significant at stake is access to oil as that resource grows ever more scarce and expensive and how a major power conducts itself in our newly interdependent world conduct that should be based on accommodation and consensus not on brute force
4650006 if georgia is subverted not only will the west be cut off from the caspian sea and central asia we can logically anticipate that putin if not resisted will use the same tactics toward the ukraine putin has already made public threats against ukraine
4650007 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4650008 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4650009 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making
4650010 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems
4650011 today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts
4650012 we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law
4650013 in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate
4650014 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4650015 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4650016 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take

4650018 if a series of causes do not start it cannot get going and if it does not get going then there will be no intermediate causes and if there are no intermediate causes then over here where we have just noticed that a blow has caused a bruise there is no explanation for what is before our eyes
4650019 if a series of causes do not start it cannot get going and there will be no intermediate causes

4650022 a cuvee of international tuscan grape varieties intensive maceration extracts the varietal characteristics ages for several months in oak it has nuances of fresh red berries and soft tannins ideal alone or with pasta chicken pork or veal
4650023 i think this is a good picture i like the focus and how the background is blurry it really makes the tree stand out the lighting for this one is also good maybe make it a little bit brighter but other than that its good
4650024 you are commanded o peoples nations and languages that when you hear the sound of the horn pipe lyre trigon harp bagpipe and every kind of music you are to fall down and worship the golden image that king nebuchadnezzar has set up and whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace
4650025 o nebuchadnezzar we have no need to answer you in this matter if this be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of your hand o king but if not be it known to you o king that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up
4650026 people should be free to pick and choose what to believe about jesus
4650027 thats true if jesus really was resurrected from the dead then this vindicates his claims that he really is the unique son of god and if hes the unique son of god then we can rely on his teachings being true and so when we add things or subtract things from his treaching were in error because wed be believing something that doesnt correspond with reality
4650028 so often people who want to create their own religion will include the idea of reincarnation
4650029 some people in the west see reincarnation as another crack at life in order to get things right sort of like the movie groundhog day theres an attraction to saying we have many opportunities and not just one lifetime actually the reality is quite different
4650030 i have too and im sure youve noticed that reincarnation is a very oppressive burden in that hindu culture as it is in the buddhist world
4650031 for example if youre a low caste or no caste hindu then youre stuck at that low level because thats what you deserve from your previous life and people shouldnt reach out to help you becuase they might jeopardize their own karma by interfering with you living out the miserable existence that you deserve
4650032 shirley maclaine said the tragedy of the human race was that we had fogotten that we were each divine why do people tend to gravitate toward that conclusion
4650033 i would rewrite her statement by saying the tragedy of the human race is that weve forgotten were gods creatures thats the problem
4650034 given a choise we tend to select beliefs that elevate who we are that diminish personal responsibility that give us greater freedom to call good what the scriptures call sin and that put ourselves in charge of our own destiny rather than saying to godk as the psalmist did my times are in your hands
4650035 we all know deep down that were flawed and imperfect what kind of god would that make us we flatter ourselves when we try to put ourselves in the place of god rather than acknowledge that we are gods creation and that we need to give god his rightful place we dont need to be more self centered than we are we need to be more god centered we cant find the real jesus by thinking that were his equal
4650036 these days if someone says he believes in jesus you almost hafve to say which jesus
4650037 were living in an age of biblical illiteracy where a lot of people have cobbled together beliefs of jesus if we ask which jesus a person believes in we may be surprised to find that its a jesus who said and did things that no serious scholar believes the historical jesus did or he may be a gnostic jesus sort of an abstract teacher of amorphous sayings whos divorced from history but i cant stress this enough what we believe about jesus doesnt really affect who he is
4650038 whether we choose to believe it or not jesus is the unique son of god how do we know because he convincingly demonstrated the trustworthiness of his remarkable claims through his resurrection he is who he is regardless of what we think so we have a choice we can live in a fantasyland of our own making by believing whatever we want about him or we can seek to discover who he really is and then bring ourselves into alignment with the real jesus and his teachings
4650039 i always wanted to travel to europe but never seemed to get around to it
4650040 how do you know its jesus you feel in your heart
4650041 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4650042 im not here to debate the sexual anomalies that you have brought up and then stand by and watch you try to equate such findings as an excuse to continue in homosexual behavior while claiming to be a christian that will ultimately be a subject between you and god
4650043 saying believing and preaching that gay sex is o k with god and need not be repented of for entrance into the kingdom of heaven is a lie from satan himself david i pray that you will one day be released from this deceptive stronghold in your life
4650044 the word of faith we are proclaiming that if you confess with your mouth
4650045 meanwhile if i were you i would be careful sharing heretical ideology with others and thus leading them away from reconcilation with god that has eternal consequences attached to it and i sincerely hope that you wouldnt want those people who were led astray by your heretical ideas to miss heaven because of it
4650046 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only the one who does the will of my father in heaven
4650047 what i do know is that gods word forbids homosexual sex between two men or two women period end of story people can twist rearrange argue debate eliminate certain verses skew the meaning of certain verses all in an effort to make scripture say what they desire it to say to satisfy their own fleshly desires and therefore their own consciences
4650048 accept christians who are weak in faith and dont argue with them about what they think is right or wrong for instance one person believes it is all right to eat anything but another believer who has a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables those who think it is all right to eat anything must not look down on those who wont and those who wont eat certain foods must not condemn those who do for god has accepted them who are you to condemn gods servants they are responsible to the lord so let him tell them whether they are right or wrong the lords power will help them do as they should
4650049 let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye
4650050 things just began to happen and i couldnt say no
4650051 i know they are living a homosexual lifestyle but as long as they are not harming me then im not going to say anything about them besides they are nice people
4650052 jaded im sorry to have to say this it appears to me that you are criticizing my words gt
4650053 story of her blog you want some cheese with that whine christine obviously you are obsessed with lesbians you focus your entire blog on homosexuality almost 95
4650054 therefore you are without excuse every man of you who passes judgment for in that you judge another you condemn yourself for you who judge practice the same things and we know that the judgment of god rightly falls upon those who practice such things and do you suppose this o man when you pass judgment upon those who practice such things and do the same yourself that you will escape the judgment of god
4650055 sometimes god calms the storm but sometimes he lets the storm rage and calms his child
4650056 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them
4650057 early in this thread but that spelling error put a song in my mind
4650058 the authority of scripture can logically be divided into two functions authority as source of truth and as norm for truth wesley sees the bible as both
4650059 i want to know one thing the way to heaven how to land safe on that happy shore god himself has condescended to teach the way for this very end he came from heaven he hath written it down in a book o give me that book at any price give me the book of god i have it here is knowledge enough for me
4650060 this is what we now style the holy scripture this is that word of god which remaineth for ever of which though heaven and earth pass away one jot or tittle shall not pass away the scripture therefore of the old and new testament is worthy of god and all things together are one entire body wherein is no defect no excess
4650061 if there be any mistakes in the bible there may as well be a thousand
4650062 if one takes wesley as meaning what he says and as saying in clear and sober terms what he means there can be no doubt that he would affirm the complete infallibility and inerrancy of the scriptures and if anyone has ever earned credibility for his statements certainly wesley has by his long and consistent life and by his zealous proclamation of the word
4650063 a little later however he says it was jesus disciples who were doing the baptizing not jesus himself since both statements were penned by the same author in the same work in close proximity it is clear that there is no contradiction here interestingly if they appeared in different gospels skeptics would cite this as a contradiction
4650064 this demonstrates for us the flexibility with which the biblical authors reported historical events
4650065 it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man
4650066 for john since jesus disciples were baptizing on his behalf it was entirely legitimate to say jesus was baptizing
4650067 matthew published his own gospel among the hebrews in their own tongue when peter and paul were preaching the gospel in rome and founding the church there after their departure mark the disciple and interpreter of peter himself handed down to us in writing the substance of peters preaching luke the follower of paul set down in a book the gospel preached by his teacher then john the disciple of the lord who also leaned on his breast himself produced his gospel while he was living at ephesus in asia
4650068 clearly the favorite disciple shows special status nevertheless the homoerotic or pederastic dimension of their relationship could be argued only in a strained way from very limited material the custom of a student resting against his teachers chest manifests cultural conventions rather than homoeroticism even where the teacher and the student are of different sexes an erotic relationship is hardly at stake
4650069 there are clear and absolute standards for what is right and wrong
4650070 whatever is understood by science is limited by the understanding of the knower
4650071 its got me to think about a lot of things i take for granted like the way my mind works the way i see things

4650073 people were very generous and we got at least four full trolley loads
4650074 we dug the ground together and planted together we sang songs and ate food together and everyone learned how to plant a veggie garden

4650080 i feel like i am hearing that you have the heart of a missionary and that its something you have been considering for a long time i feel like you have the gift for languages and can adapt to understanding and speaking them well i see you doing work in africa central africa then he paused and said possibly uganda
4650081 then after doing all those things i will pour out my spirit upon all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your old men will dream dreams and your young men will see visions in those days i will pour out my spirit even on servants men and women alike
4650082 if god existed i wouldnt i exist so god doesnt
4650083 was largely motivated by a desire to rid themselves of a cosmic moral law giver and judge
4650084 i speak from experience being strongly subject to this fear myself i want atheism to be true and am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well informed people i know are religious believers it isnt just that i dont believe in god and naturally hope that im right in my belief its that i hope there is no god i dont want there to be a god i dont want the universe to be like that my guess is that this cosmic authority problem is not a rare condition and that it is responsible for much of the scientism and reductionism of our time
4650085 i had motives for not wanting the world to have meaning consequently assumed it had none and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption the philosopher who finds no meaning in the world is not concerned exclusively with a problem in pure metaphysics he is also concerned to prove there is no valid reason why he personally should not do as he wants to do for myself as no doubt for most of my contemporaries the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation the liberation we desired was simultaneously liberation from a certain political and economic system and liberation from a certain system of morality we objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom

4650161 in fact the economic and fiscal implications of mccains plan are inextricably entwined since most of his concrete budget savings depend on highly dubious and very ideological assumptions about the impact of tax cuts on growth of pro oil and nuke policies on energy costs and most of all of subsidies for individual health insurance purchases on health care costs moreover even a cursory glance at the fiscal math of mccains plan shows a vast number of magic asterisks vague but savings rich goals trucked up as proposals ranging from nondefense budget freezes and comprehensive reviews of federal programs to some sort of latter day peace dividend contingent on victory in iraq and afghanistan

4650391 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4650392 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4650393 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4650394 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4650395 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4650396 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4650397 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4650398 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4650399 by vetoing funding for stem cell research once again the president is deferring the hopes of millions of americans who do not have the time to keep waiting for the cure that may save or extend their lives the promise that stem cells hold does not come from any particular ideology it is the judgment of science and we deserve a president who will put that judgment first and make this promise real for the american people
4650400 talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4650401 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4650402 of course there isnt power sharing right now but the talks are still going on
4650403 until we find a solution they will continue to go on because sadc doesnt have the luxury of walking away from zimbabwe
4650404 wayne bennett told us after the game we lacked a bit of aggression and we let them back into the game
4650405 we could have taken the game right away from them but we didnt
4650406 its hard we miss k hunt and hodgo hodges they do so much work around the football
4650407 we really did miss those blokes but we cant make excuses like that we still had a great side out on the paddock
4650408 im not sure why it happens but whatever it is we just need to get it right in time for the finals
4650409 that was our whole focus going into the 2004 draft that wed put together over two or three drafts a group of young players who could hopefully play a lot of footy together
4650410 weve studied a lot of premiership sides over recent times and that has certainly been their experience
4650411 you bring a lot of young kids in to the group at a similar sort of time and then have them grow and build together
4650412 geelong did that themselves through 99 2000 and 2001 they injected some really talented players into their footy club and now theyre getting full benefit from that
4650413 thats been a really good model for us to follow and we think with some of these guys committing to the footy club for the long term that hopefully its a platform for sustained success
4650414 weve had some good contests against the tigers over the last two or three years and wed expect the same tomorrow
4650415 any side thats got matty richardson and troy simmonds and those type of guys in their side is a very formidable opponent
4650416 we learnt an important lesson out of the petero civoniceva incident and were determined to do everything in our power to make sure the misbehaviour of a few does not ruin things for the vast majority of fans
4650417 weve identified a number of people who are known for unacceptable behaviour and in some cases we have banned them for extended periods
4650418 the message is clear if you misbehave you will be caught and action will be taken
4650419 ive often said we have the best fans in the league and through their actions they continue to prove it
4650420 we want our home games to be a place people are comfortable coming to and i believe were very close to ensuring that
4650421 we spoke about not getting carried away with it probably immediately after the game
4650422 it was something where we obviously enjoyed the moment but we got back to training the next morning and we just sort of said thats it thats done
4650423 we looked forward and knew how well the knights have been playing and how tough its going to be so we just got our minds back on the job
4650424 we havent got too carried away with it at all but obviously it was pleasing and it gives us a lot of confidence going forward
4650425 the reality is if we dont keep winning a few more game were not even going to be featuring in the finals
4650426 this game is really important and we know the knights are definitely going to throw a lot more at us
4650427 burgoyne is fully aware that we want to see something from him before the end of the year and him playing well in the sanfl isnt going to prove anything to us
4650428 theres probably no one out there on the field that can do the things peter can do
4650429 wed rather spend time with a player like that rather than one that might never be capable of reaching those heights thats our justification of it
4650430 if we can get peter burgoyne up and running before the end of the year it will be great for port adelaide next year
4650431 were just trying to learn that hes willing able and wanting to play football for port adelaide
4650432 weve put it on him that we want to see something
4650433 his training has really picked up over the last couple of weeks and tonight was better than it has been and thats a fact
4650434 he made some massive blunders that caused goals to be kicked against us by collingwood but we can see his effort
4650435 hes into the game and he wants to be here next year i know that for a fact

4650438 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4650439 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4650440 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4650449 i believe in healthy confrontation i thinks its perfectly appropriate to communicate to friends and loved ones that their behaviors are negatively impacting us i have found that more times than not they have no idea that their behavior or repeated remarks about the past hurt others its amazing how self involved humans have managed to become if we openly communicate with one another i believe that true healing can begin for all parties involved

4650510 that is money that could have saved some of those jobs
4650511 what were seeing is the systematic dismantling of one of the nations top newspaper companies the idea of bringing in new blood to the newspaper industry isnt a bad one because i think in a number of ways it does have old ways of thinking but when you bring in new blood those people have to bring in new strategies cutting pages and jobs isnt a strategy its just a way to cut costs which all newspaper companies are doing
4650512 what happens in five years if it looks like more of the recruitment is coming through yahoos hotjobs said outsells doctor
4650513 the core strength of a newspaper is its sales staff and its relationship to the advertiser said doctor
4650514 if they can keep that relationship it doesnt matter what they are selling
4650515 the synergies are real here if you put together the list of advertising clients cablevision has with the list of accounts newsday has and the combined contacts the sales teams have thats significant
4650516 ive been skeptical but this really is a tremendous opportunity for them
4650517 this is a permanent downsizing of newspaper companies said ken doctor
4650518 theyre not using the word permanent but its a recognition that they will get much smaller as they try to find their way in a digital world
4650519 its the end of the world as we know it

4650611 habito una utop a que no es m a ante ella mis abuelos se persignaron y mis padres entregaron sus mejores a os yo la llevo sobre los hombros sin poder sacud rmela algunos que no la viven intentan convencerme a distancia que debo conservarla sin embargo resulta enajenante vivir una ilusi n ajena cargar con el peso de lo que otros so aron a los que me impusieron sin consultarme este espejismo quiero advertirles desde ahora que no pienso hered rselo a mis hijos

4650617 debate and town hall questions typically deal with hot political topics like the war the border the price of oil and reaction to campaign statements
4650618 while important these tend to be short term issues on which the candidates have repeatedly stated their positions the saddleback civil forum will focus on the core convictions of each candidate that would shape how each one would lead and their views on americas role direction and culture
4650619 if people will actually sit down and talk to each other theyll find they have a lot more in common than they think they do
4650620 but by appearing at such an event obama will cool some of the opposition
4650621 ojal que la gente disfrute el encuentro porque se van a ver dos equipos con mucha calidad en sus planteles
4650622 ser el m ximo realizador en la historia de boca es un honor que lo disfruto con tranquilidad volver a espa a siempre es lindo
4650623 no es indispensable fichar un jugador de banda izquierda estoy contento con la plantilla que tengo adem s tengo fe en los jugadores del filial que nos pueden echar una mano
4650624 esta pretemporada los jugadores del filial me han ayudado mucho me ayudaron a integrarme en el grupo encima como son j venes y van como tiros en la din mica diaria han demostrado su nivel y que se puede contar con ellos
4650625 cada caso es diferente y los valoraremos particularmente en general todos son del filial y hay alg n caso que depende si se queda en el primer equipo de un par de cosas que tengo por la cabeza respecto a posibles cesiones primero quiero hablar con ellos en principio se quedan en casa pero hay que ver lo que quieren hacer
4650626 si quiere quedarse estoy encantado porque es su deseo y eso es lo que prevalece no se puede ir contra las voluntades de la gente ni aqu ni en valencia
4650627 se trata de un partido especial para toda la gente del bar a para el barcelona nunca hay partidos amistosos o de menos importancia nos lo tomamos con much sima seriedad espero no fallarles
4650628 a menudo viene mucha gente que no es socia y generalmente muy joven
4650629 para m tambi n ser una novedad porque es la primera vez que vengo como entrenador
4650630 a lo mejor ha perdido un poco de encanto porque la gente ya ha visto a los nuevos
4650631 el boca j niors es un rival de grand simo nivel y puede ofrecernos un espect culo trepidante
4650632 leo tiene un futuro extraordinario nunca hab a visto un jugador de tanta calidad
4650633 no tengo ninguna duda de que competiremos bien en cualquier campo y ante cualquier rival no creo que hayamos jugado contra equipos f ciles y tengo el m ximo respeto por los que han hecho mis jugadores y por los rivales a los que nos hemos enfrentado como jugador he disputado la previa de la champions y s lo mentiroso que es este partido
4650634 no podemos controlar lo que pasa fuera lo que siente la gente o lo que escriben los medios ante esto poco podemos hacer yo no soy el primer entrenador que empieza y logra seis victorias seguidas hay muchos que lo han hecho no est mal el inicio pero a n tenemos mucho que hacer vamos a tener que arreglar muchos problemas
4650635 por lo que he vivido en esta casa aqu nunca hay tranquilidad o hay poca y en el futuro no creo que la haya no puedo pretender que la haya se generan muchas noticias m s all del f tbol es bueno que haya empezado la competici n que es lo que le interesa pero siempre ir n saliendo cosas y no creo que este a o sea una excepci n
4650636 es dif cil de saber est claro que quer a hacer cosas y en general la disposici n de los jugadores es extraordinaria y me lo han hecho m s f cil no tengo ni idea en que porcentaje estamos
4650637 hay cosas generales y particulares pero por poner un ejemplo dir que no se puede ir a todas las presiones y a veces nos puede el ansia y vamos a todas
4650638 hemos decidido rebajar el precio que ped amos por arshavin
4650639 el presidente alexander dyukov quien lleva las negociaciones personalmente y por ello no puedo decir cu nto hemos bajado nuestras pretensiones exactamente

4650641 we begged students to participate they didnt respond in any way
4650642 how could negroes be so pitiful i just didnt understand
4650643 i am doing a job i cant do this job and have feeling about everything happening in jackson now you two get off this campus before i have you arrested
4650644 that beckwith and some woman and a white kid of about 17 from sidon were meeting at the bus station regularly talking about how they were going to do this job in jackson
4650645 they scared they were so polite i didnt know how to act
4650646 merely directed the group courteously through the middle of them
4650647 we would have been shot for a stunt like this
4650648 heres what hurts a man if hes scared but the trouble of it is i aint scared
4650649 were extremely disappointed at being unable to cast their votes
4650650 is the mood of the day the air of jubilation at going to vote and the infusion of this spirit in the greenwood staff
4650651 there were some in the last group who couldnt hear and one who couldnt see so well or write
4650652 then something about not giving a goddamn about any of us and niggers and cursing some more it was unintelligible
4650653 if were trying to break down segregation we cant segregate ourselves
4650654 the niggers who are going to change our way of life
4650655 one side of his face was swollen out of shape one of his eyes was blackened and bloodshot and blood was running from his swollen mouth his clothes were also torn and disarranged
4650656 elders hit me on the cheek with his fist i staggered and fell back to the window and he grabbed me and hit me in the groin with his fist very hard i fell down and he kicked me hard in the shin
4650657 to fill an intellectual and creative vacuum in the lives of young negro mississippians and to get them to articulate their own desires demands and questions to stand up in classrooms around the state and ask their teachers a real question
4650658 an educational experience for students which will make it possible for them to challenge the myths of our society to perceive more clearly its realities and to find alternatives and ultimately new directions for action
4650659 to create an awareness that some people profit by the pain of others or by misleading them
4650660 when the freedom school staff arrived in carthage the entire negro community was assembled at the church to greet them when two days later the staff was evicted from its school the community again appeared with pick up trucks to help move the library to a new school site
4650661 ive waited 80 years for you to come and i just have to give you this little bit to let you know how much we appreciate your coming i prays for your safety every night son god bless you all
4650662 of course there is no way i can hate anybody and hope to see gods face
4650663 but anyway she kept screamin and they kept beating on her and finally she started prayin for em and she asked god to have mercy on em because they didnt know what they was doin
4650664 examples of mans separation from god and from his own truest self
4650665 i saw white people do things that i had been told were done only by negroes i heard prominenr white men who stood staunchly with the system tell me to stand up and be a man although im sure their advice did not mean for me to consider myself their equal
4650666 a man is a man and i wry laugh really havent found any difference in em only that the white man will want an undercover situation its not to be talked about or anything
4650667 a colored man would do the same things i honestly dont see any difference other than the color of the mans skin
4650668 so successfully joined its studies with political activity that ir became the focal point of local organizing in shaw
4650669 la verdad sobre la agresi n de georgia se abre paso en occidente
4650670 el barcelona es un equipo de un nivel importante cuenta con jugadores de categor a y su calidad es indiscutible
4650671 nos gusta tener el bal n y el nivel de juego es bastante parejo
4650672 hace rato que les interesa pero lo vamos sosteniendo con nosotros
4650673 rodrigo es uno de los cinco mejores delanteros del mundo as que no me extra a que el barcelona se haya fijado en l
4650674 these developments he went on could cripple or destroy hedge funds investment banks and other major financial institutions like fannie mae and freddie mac the audience seemed skeptical even dismissive
4650675 pictures of people that have lost like 35 pounds in about 8 weeks
4650676 desde el 2007 cuando michael gan siete oros ninguna compa a de seguros quiso garantizar el valor y la prima que deb amos pagar casi igualaba el mill n as que con mucho gusto firmaremos el cheque si alcanza ocho medallas
4650677 a corto plazo es una mina de oro porque representa a todo lo que es puro joven fuerte y con visi n de futuro sobre estados unidos
4650678 brasil est bien con confianza es un buen momento para que se mida a camer n
4650679 mantener la posesi n en la primera parte e imprimir un fuerte ritmo en la segunda
4650680 el m ximo responsable de este resultado es l la pol tica que ha hecho de apoyar a unos s y a otros no tiene esto a los que no apoyas no terminan de ir bien y a los que apoyas no funcionan as vamos todos mal
4650681 el equipo est tocado y el nico responsable es l
4650682 maurizio no ha influido negativamente en mi preparaci n sino todo lo contrario
4650683 si no hay respeto no hay disciplina no hay nada
4650684 las chicas somos m s inestables m s sentimentales m s apasionadas todo lo que me ha ocurrido durante los ltimos a os dentro y fuera de la competici n ha servido para endurecerme me declaro pues una superviviente creo que ahora soy mucho mejor
4650685 ahora que soy campeona del mundo tambi n quiero el t tulo ol mpico
4650686 para una chica sola todo es mucho m s dif cil no soy como rafa nadal o como un futbolista pero he conseguido vivir de mi deporte y no me quejo
4650687 esta es la diferencia entre la campeona del mundo actual y las del 99 o 2000 cuando a n estaba aprendiendo
4650688 era muy dif cil para m porque djokovic es uno de los jugadores que mejor se adapta a este tipo de pistas de cemento al descubierto s lo le hab a ganado una vez el a o pasado era de los m s dif ciles que me pod a encontrar
4650689 porque este triunfo significa asegurar una medalla y ya dije antes de empezar que se era mi objetivo fuera de lo que fuera la medalla por mi mentalidad soy un deportista de equipo y cuando juego por un equipo disfruto m s que cuando lo hago solo estoy disfrutando de esta competici n y quiero dar las gracias a todos los espa oles que me he encontrado por la villa llegu aqu muy cansado porque s lo he estado 10 d as en casa en los ltimos cinco meses y si hubiera pasado una semana solo todo hubiera sido mucho m s dif cil
4650690 porque no tiene nada que ver este s lo se juega una vez cada cuatro a os no sabes si lo volver s a jugar y adem s representas a tu pa s quiz s nosotros le damos un poquito m s de importancia a los torneos de grand slam pero inmediatamente despu s ya viene ste
4650691 estamos acostumbrados a los partidos duros y adem s tenemos un d a para recuperarnos no creo que haya problemas en este sentido
4650692 durmiendo hasta las 12 porque no me acostar antes de las 4 entre la cena y el masaje hablando con mis amigos de las puertas del lado que son los de baloncesto y me gustar a ir a ver en directo su partido con estados unidos
4650693 debemos hacer una buena defensa de equipo porque frenarles a nivel individual es imposible
4650694 se trata de un compendio de piezas fascinante e ntimo que he conseguido reunir con mucha suerte durante estos ltimos diez a os
4650695 son aquellas que sin duda han tenido a la entidad y al fundador como protagonistas
4650696 oh well in archicad you can do this and this and this
4650697 he has made clear his concern for iraqi civilians in mixed neighborhoods who might be more vulnerable following a withdrawal of us combat brigades he would offer these civilians fair notice of us plans and would be open to relocating those who would feel more secure if they moved
4650698 even if this latest hint turns out to be true the timescale seems far too slow our troops should be home from iraq by christmas at the very latest
4650699 it must be immensely frustrating for our service men and women on the ground in iraq to know they are there more as political cover for the brown bush relationship than to provide any real help to the iraqi people
4650700 quiero ganar la medalla de oro y luego jugar donde me digan
4650701 tenga su propia personalidad no va a ser un equipo diferente porque el rival sea el real madrid no hay que dar bandazos en funci n del rival
4650702 ser un equipo intenso solidario junto para defender y atrevido en ataque
4650703 el madrid tiene una gran plantilla y tenemos que parar sus cualidades pero el 30 de la atenci n debe centrarse en el rival y el 70 en nosotros
4650704 no ten a ni idea de que iba a alcanzar esta cifra tan trascendental
4650705 but i will finish with another example of how i think analytics delivered in a simple interface is going to change so many things
4650706 la br jula y el metr nomo en campo rival
4650707 estoy muy satisfecho porque veo que vamos a m s en cada partido
4650708 he visto bien al equipo en l neas generales con el bal n en los pies hemos estado m s seguros que en otras ocasiones vamos a m s a medida que pasan los partidos y me siento bastante satisfecho con el partido que se ha hecho es verdad que los jugadores llevan mucha carga de trabajo y eso pesa a la hora de jugar pero he visto mucha m s frescura con el bal n en los pies y eso es lo que quer amos que sucediera s lo nos ha faltado el gol para que el amistoso fuese completo porque creo que se han creado suficientes ocasiones
4650709 en este partido ya ten a previsto dar noventa minutos a muchos jugadores porque tenemos cuatro amistosos consecutivos y los estamos haciendo por bloques es probable que los que han jugado esta tarde descansen en el pr ximo porque todos tienen que ir acumulando minutos en la pretemporada
4650710 es una l stima que se haya lesionado para tanto tiempo pero as es el f tbol aqu tenemos a los chicos del filial que est n aportando cosas pero est claro que estamos buscando un central de garant as para afrontar la temporada espero que lo tengamos antes de que acabe el plazo porque es necesario
4650711 es el principal reclamo de estos juegos y ha de estar preparado para ganar mucho dinero
4650712 los juegos son una vez cada cuatro a os es verdad que se trata de una caja de resonancia magn fica pero nos resulta m s f cil llevar a deportistas que compiten cada semana
4650713 bueno est bien y qu van a hacer ustedes al respecto
4650714 this update fixes several issues to improve the stability of mac pro early 2008 computers

4650716 you know nobody else sells that 3ghz quad core xeon right
4650717 you can make these up to one week in advance
4650718 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4650719 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
4650720 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4650721 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4650722 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4650723 a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
4650724 we agree with the mediation but we dont think that people who are in these negotiations should be attending as if they have won an election
4650725 an alternative resource that brings about awareness and focuses on the individual
4650726 these are baseball decisions the shakeups got to come from the guys that are expected to perform melky cabrera batting ninth in our lineup is not supposed to be a difference maker in this club either way he was supposed to be able to slide right in while everybody else did their job
4650727 what we need is obviously the guys were counting on the guys that are making a significant amount of money that have significant performance levels to get the job done as expected and ill throw myself involved in that too i want to make sure im not pointing fingers were all in this thing together
4650728 its definitely good to get the opportunity to go out there and be that guy
4650729 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is
4650730 we believe that hes a much better player than a 240 hitter
4650731 the effort was there but for whatever reason it wasnt translating sometimes it can be difficult for young players to get out of a rut at this level
4650732 i cant tell you the exact date that hes going to be back but im confident that melkys a and that hell get his stuff right
4650733 i want to pitch for a long time i dont want to pitch for a year so i understand ive got to be patient
4650734 i believe richie still has good baseball in him but i believe richies an everyday player and i think it was tough what we were asking him to do
4650735 we were unable to get off the ground at all with the negotiations they did not even want to receive an offer
4650736 they made a decision and it was a different one than we would have expected
4650737 we missed out on the fa cup final last season so this time we will try to win every trophy
4650738 we have the ability so we will try to develop and achieve even better results than we did last season
4650739 i believe we can do it because even though we have no new signings we havent lost any players either which is the most important thing
4650740 hes doing very well hes well ahead of schedule and the specialists were surprised with the condition that hes in
4650741 for the next three weeks hell be on rehabilitation then endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side with us
4650742 the new additions dont really matter because we know kevins style kevin always has a go and thats a great quality the lads got and i think well find that on sunday
4650743 im looking forward to the united match im fit and ready to play and hopefully can make a real difference to the team i cant wait to get started
4650744 i know carlos very well and i know the way that he plays im looking forward to trying to put one over on him on sunday its an exciting prospect
4650745 for me personally i dont consider it a risk playing at old trafford because ive got to play my first match somewhere so why not sunday
4650746 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4650747 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4650748 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4650749 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4650750 yeah i believe you you know shae i like you as a friend but i really just dont swing that way
4650751 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4650752 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4650753 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4650754 are you going to stop hiding behind kat so much now there are less people
4650755 when you and mo were in jail i came out
4650756 which two people did you throw the heaven and hell thing for
4650757 i think youre slick clever and smart and you take the piss sometimes
4650758 you got mo put in jail and its like its always your way or no way everyone has to be friends with your friends youre too much sometimes
4650759 it gave me a taste of when we get out of here i had a really good time
4650760 our focus should be not on emerging technologies but on emerging cultural practices
4650761 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4650762 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4650763 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4650764 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4650765 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4650766 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4650767 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4650768 so brad what youre saying is you believe in droidism

4651029 prices have fallen sharply and quickly in very distressed markets but most or all of the price declines may have already occurred in these areas since buyers have now returned to those markets

4651035 they are growing with e commerce we have them growing faster than credit card or debit card payments but they are starting from a smaller base
4651036 so far it has been fabulous and that type of success breeds on itself
4651037 the best part of our culture is we have a furious desire to go fast and build stuff and have customers use products that are uniquely paypal and very special in their lives

4651039 the level of excess capacity has shrunk down in the last few years to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry
4651040 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it
4651041 and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers
4651042 if you dont have generation and transmission something has to give
4651043 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4651044 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4651045 i believe this is also good news for the industry
4651046 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal
4651047 you know the water in luang prabang province is going down so it may reach vientiane tomorrow or the day after

4651055 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4651056 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4651057 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4651058 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4651059 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them

4651139 passing over the previously empty desert area between iraq and kuwait spotted iraqi troops assembling on the iraqi side of the border
4651140 identified over the next week a formidable iraqi force that included 300 of saddam husseins most modern t 72 tanks an elite republican guard division and about 35 000 iraqi troops poised in a coil formation on kuwaits northern border even more ominous a long line of fuel trucks had joined the tail of the coil indicating the force was prepared to move an extended distance
4651141 virtually impossible to close for an extended period even with advanced weapons and large numbers of aircraft
4651142 possibly the families of elite government and intelligence personnel were using the shelter as a refuge to escape nighttime bombing about 400 iraqi civilians mostly women and children died in the attack another 200 were injured severely u s intelligence never detected the civilian presence and still believes the shelter was used at least during the day by iraqs intelligence agencies as a back up communications post

4651211 muchas terapias podr an resultar en mejoras adem s de en tratamientos ser a inaceptable su uso s lo porque son demasiado efectivas
4651212 una vez que la tecnolog a se haya demostrado segura renunciar a usarla tambi n es decidir sobre el patrimonio gen tico de nuestros descendientes espec ficamente es decidir que ellos no disfrutar n de sus beneficios si pudi ramos erradicar una enfermedad grave para las futuras generaciones y decidi ramos no hacerlo dudo de que nuestros descendientes nos lo agradecieran

4651214 hoy nadie duda en mejorar el sistema inmune de sus hijos con vacunas una mejora de por vida irreversible y decidida por los padres no por el ni o adem s las vacunas funcionan porque seleccionan determinados cambios gen ticos en los genes responsables de la inmunidad por la misma raz n s sabemos y as lo hemos demostrado por ejemplo nosotros con ratones que introduciendo unas copias extra de un gen en lo que luego ser n espermatozoides u ovocitos podemos literalmente eliminar la posibilidad de c ncer o de alzh imer o de enfermedad cardiovascular y sin efectos secundarios por qu impedirlo

4651228 es un sistema pionero en el mundo que se desarroll a petici n nuestra
4651229 cada vez que se detiene a una persona relacionada con alguno de estos delitos le grabamos la voz al mismo tiempo que le tomamos la foto y las huellas dactilares pero a diferencia de estas ltimas la voz cambia continuamente por lo que hay que grabar varias veces y en distintos canales
4651230 de manera que obtenemos una valoraci n cient fica de la semejanza de la voz cuestionada con la de los candidatos
4651231 por eso este sistema es tan til a la hora de confirmar que nuestras investigaciones est n bien encaminadas al permitirnos comprobar que las conversaciones que grabamos pertenecen a quienes creemos
4651232 suele haber muchas conexiones entre grupos criminales y pensamos en la gran utilidad de un sistema de este tipo que nos permitiera detectar autom ticamente que por ejemplo la voz de un narcotraficante de una banda gallega aparece en una conversaci n registrada en c diz por un caso de secuestro y as enlazar investigaciones
4651233 esta es s lo una las muchas aplicaciones de ltima generaci n que tenemos en realidad nos alejamos mucho de la imagen tradicional que se tiene de nosotros

4651274 se trata del presidente de nicaragua y eso afecta a todos los nicarag enses
4651275 repudian la presencia en calidad de invitado oficial en su pa s del violador daniel ortega saavedra que por 20 a os esclaviz sexualmente a la hija de su esposa
4651276 ese tambi n puede ser un rechazo por todas las actitudes que ha tenido ortega
4651277 es una cuesti n de principios ella como mujer que va a velar por los derechos humanos de las mujeres est tratando de ser consecuente
4651278 eso habla bien del esp ritu de nimo del nuevo gobierno del presidente electo fernando lugo
4651279 la manifestaci n de la ministra gloria rubin habla bien del esp ritu del nuevo gobierno pues indica que se respeta la ley la divergencia y la libre opini n
4651280 es llamativo que sea una ministra de gobierno la que encabeza el rechazo de un presidente lugo que acaba de estar en el pa s como invitado de ortega
4651281 habla bien del r gimen paraguayo porque aqu un ministro o ministra no se estar a atreviendo a criticar a un ministro o personalidad invitada por el gobierno de ortega a la toma de posesi n
4651282 ojal ese rechazo no vaya a tener repercusiones negativas en la ministra rubin y en los que la acompa an en esta posici n
4651283 ha golpeado la conciencia de ciudadanos y de sectores que resguardan los derechos de esas mujeres abusadas
4651284 es dif cil comprender y aceptar que daniel ortega haya alcanzado la primera magistratura tomando en cuenta los requisitos morales y ticos de ese cargo
4651285 la gente viene porque tiene un gran amor a la virgen muchos me han comentado que quieren pedirle por toda la situaci n que vivimos en venezuela para que cambie

4651304 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4651305 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4651306 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4651307 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4651308 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4651309 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4651331 strong allegiance to conservatism and conservative positions of young white evangelicals may be the product of dissatisfaction with this particular administration rather than the result of an underlying shift in this groups political values and policy views

4651335 race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve exposure to widely diverse people cultures ideas and viewpoints
4651336 the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity viewing race exclusively in white nonwhite terms in seattle and black other terms in jefferson county
4651337 classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of this courts precedents and the nations history of using race in public schools and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it
4651338 threatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of race related litigation and it undermines browns promise of integrated primary and secondary education that local communities have sought to make a reality
4651339 this cannot be justified in the name of the equal protection clause
4651340 while i join justice breyers eloquent and unanswerable dissent in its entirety it is appropriate to add these words
4651341 there is a cruel irony in the chief justices reliance on our decision in brown vs board of education
4651342 it is my firm conviction that no member of the court that i joined in 1975 would have agreed with todays decision
4651343 the cost of being black white americans perceptions and the question of reparations
4651344 the costs of being black in our society are very well documented
4651345 blacks have significantly lower income and wealth higher levels of poverty and even shorter life spans among many other disparities compared to whites
4651346 when whites say they would need 1 million to give up tv but less than 10 000 to become black that suggests they dont really understand the extent to which african americans as a group are disadvantaged
4651347 when you take it out of the black white context white americans seem to fully appreciate the costs associated with the kinds of disparities that african americans actually face in the united states
4651348 our data suggest that such resistance is not because white americans are mean and uncaring morally bankrupt or ethically flawed
4651349 white americans suffer from a glaring ignorance about what it means to live as a black american
4651350 what to the american slave is your fourth of july to him your celebration is a sham your boasted liberty and unholy license your national greatness swelling vanity your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless your denunciation of tyrants brass fronted impudence your shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery your prayers and hymns your sermons and thanksgivings with all your religious parades and solemnity are to him mere bombasts deceptions and pious and hypocrisy a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages
4651351 the african trade is the first principle and foundation of all the rest
4651352 that the orangutan preferred black women to those of his own species
4651353 black republicans may outvote us but we can out count them

4651361 dallas mavericks owner mark cuban gave a presentation to the fcc about the future of digital media and his number one point was that people will be able to go to a movie theater and watch a major sporting event in 3 d it truly is a different experience from seeing a game on 2 d television its not like seeing it live either but something different and interesting as the pace folks explained for instance they discovered that constant cutting to different shots a tv staple isnt necessary in 3 d it seems better to let the camera take in the full court action viewers feel a little like theyre watching from halfway up the arena seats

4651368 sam miller a 21 year old student at the university of hertfordshire created this 2 minute short clouds which follows a young girls adventures flying through the sky the film which took miller around 5 months to complete was produced as part of his second year at school the character animation was created in flash and the clouds were handled in after effects
4651369 some modern layout artists see a license for anarchy in these stylized images i see very slightly distorted perspectives and stylistic interpretations of reality but with still great planning and organization of all the graphic elements into a quickly readable statement that has a purpose in the scene and story each element does not follow its own physics it is subservient to the overall composition every detail follows and helps define the larger object it is part of
4651370 how the hell did they come up with this great bumper not only is this frame the best drawing of bullwinkle but just about every aspect of the cartoon is inspired how would you plan a cartoon like this certainly not with a script i dont think you could do it with just a storyboard either because it has no logical continuity but it all seems to go perfectly to the crazy wonderful music
4651371 the film to me felt less like an animated film than a special effect film
4651372 the technical abilities are high and the film is done with the greatest professionalism but theyre machines being animated and i never felt close to them the iron giant from that film was a hostile war machine and was supposed to stay a machine but i felt more for that character than i did for wall e or his cutely developed girlfriend eve the film has a better concept than story its the bane of all movies these days if you can narrow the story down to one sentence its more concept than story and has a harder time being successful wall e feels a lot like short circuit 3 with no humans for at least the first half

4651391 the fact that you are graduating from harvard suggests that you are not very well acquainted with failure i think it fair to say that by any conventional measure a mere seven years after my graduation day i had failed on an epic scale an exceptionally short lived marriage had imploded and i was jobless a lone parent and as poor as it is possible to be in modern britain without being homeless the fears my parents had had for me and that i had had for myself had both come to pass and by every usual standard i was the biggest failure i knew now i am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun that period of my life was a dark one and i had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution i had no idea how far the tunnel extended and for a long time any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality so why do i talk about the benefits of failure simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential i stopped pretending to myself that i was anything other than what i was and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me had i really succeeded at anything else i might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena i believed i truly belonged i was set free because my greatest fear had already been realised and i was still alive and i still had a daughter whom i adored and i had an old typewriter and a big idea and so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which i rebuilt my life failure gave me an inner security that i had never attained by passing examinations failure taught me things about myself that i could have learned no other way such knowledge is a true gift for all that it is painfully won and it has been worth more to me than any qualification i ever earned
4651392 just as a film is not measured by the quality of its special effects a game is not measured merely by its graphics
4651393 the end of theory the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete
4651394 sixty years ago digital computers made information readable twenty years ago the internet made it reachable ten years ago the first search engine crawlers made it a single database now google and like minded companies are sifting through the most measured age in history treating this massive corpus as a laboratory of the human condition they are the children of the petabyte age
4651395 this is a world where massive amounts of data and applied mathematics replace every other tool that might be brought to bear out with every theory of human behavior from linguistics to sociology forget taxonomy ontology and psychology who knows why people do what they do the point is they do it and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity with enough data the numbers speak for themselves

4651404 todo jogador trabalha para ser titular e eu n o sou diferente nosso ataque tem excelentes jogadores e o muricy sempre pode contar com boas op es por isso sigo trabalhando e me empenhando para voltar ao time e ajudar o clube
4651405 temos consci ncia de que estamos devendo e precisamos voltar a vencer por isso mesmo com toda a qualidade do atl tico e todo respeito que temos por eles um empate no morumbi ser um resultado muito ruim
4651406 temos necessidade de vencer n o s pelos quatro jogos sem vit ria mas tamb m porque n o podemos deixar os advers rios se distanciarem ainda mais
4651407 trabalhamos muito esse fundamento durante a semana nesses ltimos jogos erramos muitos passes e quanto mais a gente erra mais dif cil fica conseguir armar uma jogada um contra ataque obter um bom resultado
4651408 cada ano o campeonato fica mais dif cil as equipes se refor am e crescem de produ o existem v rios times com chances de conquistar o t tulo e o s o paulo com toda certeza um deles
4651409 estamos trabalhando para voltar a vencer e com certeza vamos entrar em breve na briga pelo t tulo
4651410 no s o paulo nenhum jogador ter vaga assegurada nunca pois um grande time que conta sempre com grandes jogadores e tem uma cobran a di ria
4651411 para eu ser mantido no time titular tenho que continuar jogando bem
4651412 ontem conversei com o presidente e expliquei minha situa o como n o havia possibilidade de seguir aqui disse que o grupo precisava se formar sem mim que gostaria de ter um per odo de descanso antes de voltar pra fran a dentre outras coisas ele correto como sempre aceitou meus argumentos e definimos a minha sa da
4651413 avalio minha passagem como boa mas poderia ter sido muito melhor se tiv ssemos conquistado t tulos quando cheguei ao clube esse era meu principal objetivo e infelizmente n o consegui isso me deixa triste e decepcionado mas saio de cabe a erguida
4651414 pena que s consegui alcan ar meu melhor futebol no final do contrato acho que saio devendo mas com a certeza de que sempre procurei dar meu melhor lamento ter chegado ao clube ap s um m s parado e sem ter feito uma pr temporada adequada
4651415 sempre fui profissional e respeitei o clube dei o meu m ximo enquanto estive aqui deixo aqui boas lembran as bons amigos estou deixando um grupo muito bom e um clube exemplar
4651416 s tenho a agradecer gostaria de dizer obrigado a todos presidente diretoria comiss o t cnica jogadores e torcida que sempre me apoiou o presidente me disse que as portas do clube est o abertas para mim fico muito feliz com isso
4651417 eles s o jogadores que recuperamos e isso traz muita satisfa o para o t cnico porque s o patrim nios do clube t m que ser valorizados e n o largados
4651418 o gol estava amadurecendo e a confian a aumentando hoje me sinto melhor e mais adaptado ao time esse gol vai me fazer muito bem
4651419 foi um momento dif cil mas que felizmente est superado
4651420 os primeiros gols simbolizam n o s a minha recupera o mas a do time todo
4651421 sem d vida essa convoca o me d uma motiva o extra para me recuperar bem e voltar o quanto antes
4651422 volto aos treinos com muita vontade espero ajudar o s o paulo no s bado contra o atl tico mineiro
4651423 eu acho que o clube que tem que definir seus objetivos sou centralizador no trabalho di rio com o time mas nesse caso tenho que consultar o presidente preciso saber se a copa sul americana interessante ou n o se vi vel financeiramente ou n o se vai ser bom lan ar os meninos ou n o at agora n o conversamos sobre isso vamos sentar e ver o que fazer em breve
4651424 n o tem como segurar o mercado assim mesmo mas como t cnico n o posso ficar lamentando buscando desculpas minha obriga o encontrar solu es e fazer o time jogar
4651425 perdemos a melhor dupla de volantes do brasil no final de 2006 e logo depois formamos outra dupla que foi eleita a melhor do campeonato brasileiro em 2007 lembrou o t cnico se referindo as vendas de josu e mineiro e seus sucessores hernanes e richarlyson
4651426 if you ever met her youd know that she owns me this is my one hour a day when i get to run around and be cheeky
4651427 and i had just transferred from the newton abbot branch i dont think i did anything much different that day just arranged the new altar range of bowls in the window put up some horses bells and opened up for the day but the hunger of the people for high quality well designed kitchenware at reasonable prices was such that weve had to open the store up for special overflow sessions on weekday evenings id heard of things like this happening before they felt like long distant stories but now were in the middle of one of them
4651428 initially and to everyones surprise this great influx of people did not really translate itself into increased sales
4651429 but we believe that this shortfall may have been due to the numbers of people falling to the ground as they strove to approach the checkout the experience seems to have been too much for some of them to handle but as the days and weeks have passed with ever increasing levels of zeal and fervency large numbers have come to visit the store many travelling impressive distances we have seen in them a great desire not only to engage with the unique lakeland shopping experience but to take some of our unique designs back home with them to share with their local communities in this way people in many different locations in the west country and around the world have been touched by what is going on here
4651430 what better chance than now to have a little talk with jesus
4651431 jesus im tired why do i drive myself to work so hard
4651432 many men work hard to show their family how much they love them and care for them you work hard to provide a safe beautiful place for your friends and family to get together and enjoy
4651433 no the love of money is the root of all evil money is but a tool a tool that can be used for good or for bad
4651434 what is the meaning of life why am i here is this all there is
4651435 many men have asked those soul searching questions and the answer is inside in your heart but it is different for everyone
4651436 now as much as i would love to chat with you some more senor i really need to finish mowing your yard
4651437 watch gretzkys head bleed look man i made is head bleed
4651438 we expect some things to be controlled in a directed economy the question is the unpredictability
4651439 russia has become the largest risk in the financial markets
4651440 we thought the combination of a fed nowhere near hiking rates persistent financial system problems and a weak economy would keep the u s dollar on its back foot and vulnerable to retest its lows
4651441 based on fresh fears that consumption most notably of gasoline will continue to fall
4651442 the match has struck the fuse has been lit and four or five years from now opec producers are going to be drinking their own oil and choking on it
4651443 it is extremely important to maintain our existing store base in a tough environment with significant competition for customers whose disposable income is shrinking
4651444 the biggest boost to the consumers mood is falling gas prices
4651445 sentiments going to remain under pressure until consumers recognize the economy is finding its footing
4651446 it would be logical for him to increase his utility and energy holdings and nrg would fit in nicely
4651447 people are spending as much today on gasoline as they did in the 1970s and 1980s
4651448 its one more statistic in what appears to be an unprecedented string of bad news
4651449 i can live happy with or without her but i still love her and it would be better with her
4651450 with that she walked back in wal mart just got cigarettes and came right back
4651451 it looked like four guys fighting with one man and one man had a knife and slashed opened up his hand pretty good
4651452 i pulled up behind her so she couldnt get out and i was blowing my horn

4651455 i am breast feeding so i can feed babies i didnt think of it much
4651456 it is a mothers reaction and a basic duty as a police officer to help

4651464 one of the key negative fallouts of the global settlement has been the loss of coverage for a host of small cap companies thus depriving the investors genuine growth opportunities pirps are an interesting way out for companies that seek more action on their counters
4651465 from where we sit our position being one of objective measurement it looks like half as many companies are able to move into or maintain this high growth pace
4651466 we utilize technology to push clients to us instead of pounding on their doors
4651467 while the medical cost containment field may not be the sexiest industry during good market conditions it is certainly stable and more recession proof than other industries in a down time no matter what type of economic environment our country is experiencing people always need medical treatment its not a luxury its a necessity

4651472 the fact that so many other people have blogs now makes it so much more fun and such a fantastic
4651473 it reminds me a little of being in school in primary school you are forced to be friends with kids because they merely live in your neighbourhood and school throws you together
4651474 young iraqis in baghdad are surfing the internet to search for partners to tie the knot as violence and sectarian tensions take their toll on more traditional forms of socialising
4651475 i think the iraqis are looking for love on the internet because there are no other places for them to meet
4651476 they were trying to reverse so they can go up the intersection then i seen the car coming so i ran up and they took ryan all the way up here and thats when they came back and they hit two cars that was over there

4651480 we had hoped the operator would comply with the moe order and clean up the exterior of the properties
4651481 at this time its critical for the city to do whatever is necessary so that these residents can resume some sense of normalcy in their neighbourhood after this traumatic event cleaning up the asbestos and debris from the explosion is an important part of making that happen
4651482 the provinces priority is to get the cleanup of the residential properties done quickly safely and effectively we have been in discussions with the city of toronto throughout the day and we fully support this action
4651483 we will continue to work closely with the city of toronto in its cleanup efforts

4651493 this is not the marines this is the big brother house
4651494 its just one more thing he let slip out of his fat mouth that he is going to regret saying
4651495 i do say a lot of things without thinking first but that is something that im trying to change about myself
4651496 it takes a lot of votes to lead up to eviction and to put it all on one vote
4651497 although there is an exemption for solicitations sent to a significant segment of the public this exemption does not apply to situations in which the candidate has reason to know that the list includes city employees as was the case involving the e mail sent by mr demaios campaign committee

4651505 every two years the spirits of competition grow especially fervent and draw close to the mortal realm
4651506 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood
4651507 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4651508 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4651509 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4651510 eleven persons died yesterday after having been victims of several bullet impacts in different violent acts in the departments of guatemala jutiapa jalapa zacapa and izabal
4651511 guatemalans in rhode island will celebrate the first festival in that state
4651512 we want it to be a meeting of family get togetherness to which we will try to bring the largest number of guatemalan families who live in the area
4651513 now ossetians are running around and killing poor georgians in their enclaves
4651514 they entered the houses took whatever they liked and burned everything
4651515 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4651516 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4651517 pac man changed the psychological profile of the average person
4651518 computer games dont affect kids i mean if pac man affected us as kids wed all be running around in darkened rooms munching pills and listening to repetitive music
4651519 we believe that spot wti crude oil prices will remain over 50 per barrel despite the bearish signal of the super contango
4651520 going forward we expect global oil demand growth to decelerate modestly in line with a slowing global economy but higher long dated prices and infrastructure bottlenecks will likely combine to support spot crude oil prices
4651521 much of the oil in known reserves needs a higher price to make it worth extracting
4651522 world population collapse is just around the corner let s say 2050 this coupling of population decline with increased efficiency will compensate for increases in energy use
4651523 oil is only one source of energy if it gets truly expensive the future will still be awash with energy because so many new sources are waiting in the wings for oil to get more expensive new energy sources are all around us
4651524 the alberta oil sands contain the equivalent of 1 6 trillion barrels of oil more than all of the world oil reserves combined a higher price will turn this resource into a reserve
4651525 tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4651526 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4651527 of course christ is the truth and only he has words of eternal life
4651528 but surely there must be some history of school shootings in this district
4651529 the inhabitants of the indian archipelago or malayan archipelago would become respectively indunesians or malayunesians
4651530 mr earl suggests the ethnographical term indunesian but rejects it in favour of malayunesian i prefer the purely geographical term indonesia which is merely a shorter synonym for the indian islands or the indian archipelago
4651531 talking with forest service firefighters i have been saying this is the sistine chapel the mount sinai the vatican
4651532 we hope and pray that he will become the best us president of all time
4651533 we hope and pray that he will become the best us president of all time
4651534 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
4651535 i enlarged the pictures and immersed each one in a developing tray filled with fresh blood slowly the picture would float up toward the surface of the blood i watched as the faces of the martyrs gradually emerged from the red depths as if their souls were entering the pictures bringing them back to life like inky monsoon clouds refusing to disperse the blood did not clear away completely and parts of their faces remained in shadow before pressing the shutter i raised my hands to pay respect praying to each one if there is something you want to say to the people of today please manifest your message through my work and i will be your channel one young woman who couldve been my older sister reddened her eyes deeply as if in response an unforgettable image that will forever stay with me
4651536 i believe in my heart and soul that i embody the heart and soul of newfoundlanders and labradorians
4651537 from a green shift perspective as well newfoundland and labrador is just basically waiting to see where all the cards are going to fall here
4651538 t his election is not going to be decided strictly on green shift
4651539 mr mintz seems to be using income funds as the thin edge of the wedge in his pursuit of a larger agenda of tax reform he has been chasing for years
4651540 thats a lot of whats behind mintzs approach to this whole issue
4651541 no one wants to star in the remake of a movie that was a disaster the first time it ran
4651542 when to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4651543 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of
4651544 in terms of the financial aspects of it those discussions would be between us and the retailers and theyre not going to be made public
4651545 they also havent happened yet as our first priority is obviously to fix the cat cracker
4651546 these refineries are old they do go down they do require a lot of maintenance
4651547 the larger picture is that in a normal industry the outage of one factory isnt going to throw the whole industry into turmoil but the fact that you have so few refineries and theyre running at capacity during peak season like this as soon one goes down it causes a lot of trouble

4651558 el mercado de seguros de vida por un lado se ha visto favorecido por la expansi n del pbi de los ltimos a os y por el otro y que resulta fundamental la empresa empez con un plan de expansi n una importante inversi n en recursos y en desarrollo tecnol gico haciendo foco en el segmento de vida colectiva de accidentes personales tambi n hemos desarrollado nuevos productos que funcionaron muy bien y ayudaron a este crecimiento
4651559 en la actualidad los seguros de vida representan 15 del mercado total de seguros en la argentina
4651560 de a poco la gente contrata m s seguros de vida se toma mayor conciencia en esto tiene mucho que ver la industria que hace grandes esfuerzos porque esta situaci n var e en otros pa ses los estados dan fuertes incentivos fiscales para la contrataci n de seguros de vida eso no ocurre en la argentina de hecho han quedado fijos desde la crisis de 2001 con lo cual se desincentiv en los ltimos a os contratar seguros de vida avira que re ne a aseguradores de vida y retiro de la rep blica argentina ha presentado varios proyectos al gobierno para modificar esta situaci n

4651564 i see a hunger in the world that i dont see in the church
4651565 our party speaks for human freedom for the sweep of liberties that are at the core of our existence we do not shirk from our duties to preserve freedom so it can unfold across the world for yearning millions we believe that lasting peace comes only through strength and not through the goodwill of our adversaries we have a healthy skepticism of government checking its excesses at the same time were willing to harness its energy when it helps improve the lives of our citizens we have pretty strong notions that higher tax receipts are no inherent right of the federal government we respect the values that bind us together as families and as a nation i believe that god put this land between the two great oceans to be found by special people from every corner of the world who had that extra love of freedom that prompted them to leave their homeland and come to this land to make it a brilliant light beam of freedom to the world
4651566 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis
4651567 we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
4651568 u n mediators cant even protect the dissident monks of burma or the opposition in zimbabwe let alone a small country trying to fight off single handed an invasion by the russian army
4651569 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4651570 us should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4651571 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
4651572 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
4651573 i welcome the announcement that the united states and poland have agreed on a missile defense plan for europe
4651574 rather than exchanging charges over missile defense i would urge moscow to comply with the ceasefire in georgia and immediately begin withdrawing its forces from sovereign georgian territory i welcome secretary rices visit to tbilisi and believe that the entire international community should do its utmost to bring aid to the georgian people
4651575 i knew right then and there that there was going to be some serious issues but there was no getting away from it
4651576 i mean it goes up pretty quickly and within a minute my truck was melting down
4651577 i knew something was going to be wrong right after i went through that big flame suddenly i could feel the heat through the cab
4651578 if the caps wouldnt have exploded off the tanks it could have been a big boom
4651579 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4651580 we wanted to beat them more than we did last time
4651581 he had fairly serious head injuries he also had some bruises and abrasions on his body
4651582 no i mean technically its the hair at the top of your inner thighs is that better
4651583 experience is what you get when you dont get what you want
4651584 when we get down inside the red zone we cant turn the ball over
4651585 weve got to be smart with the football and we were tonight we had one negative play in the whole situation its hard to tell when you get in the red zone because you have to break tackles in order to score because the defense doesnt have to defend the whole field so we may have scored more we have may stopped them more we were spotting the ball and its just a best guess when its not full contact
4651586 my perspective is that the main officer enders handling it was cool at first but then he started threatening that everybody would be arrested but trying to kick the party out at 11 20 p m on a wedding night when we had a contract to be there he was a big jerk
4651587 i didnt believe it but i witnessed it it was brutal and thats when andy got really mad
4651588 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body

4651631 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4651632 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4651633 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4651634 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4651635 whatever weakens your reason whatever impairs the tenderness of your conscience whatever obscures your sense of god whatever increases the authority of your body over your mind whatever takes away from your relish for spiritual things that to you is sin no matter how innocent it is in itself

4651652 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4651653 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4651654 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life

4651658 were just all trying to celebrate with the team embrace the fans and help them out its going to be more of a traffic situation as all these folks drive circles around the stadium trying to find some place to park
4651659 i dont want any of my friends and neighbors to get a ticket on a car just because theyre trying to park closer to the stadium thats not doing them any favors
4651660 its going to be a mess theres so many private parking areas at individual homes
4651661 ill try to find a friend or somebody in the area that will let us park
4651662 now with increased police and code enforcement officers in the neighborhoods during games we have the manpower to enforce it
4651663 after habitual violations on a single property the property owner may be approached by the police and possibly cited

4651665 youve got way more people being intoxicated and doing bad things
4651666 is it really worth police checking on cars parked on lawns
4651667 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4651669 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4651670 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4651671 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4651672 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4651673 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4651679 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4651680 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4651681 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4651682 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
4651683 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
4651684 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4651685 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4651686 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4651687 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4651688 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips

4651716 since obamas hubris in berlin he has lost almost every cycle of this campaign and lost all of them quite badly im not sure his campaign gets how far they have sunk and how ineffectual and passive obama has seemed these past few weeks
4651717 we all know too well the serious and devastating consequences of addictions and i can only imagine how hard it is for someone struggling with addiction to reach out for help
4651718 there are people in our province courageously reaching out for that assistance every day of their lives our government recognizes how critical it is to ensure that help is available for these individuals when they need it the most
4651719 the new humberwood centre certainly supports western healths vision of healthy people healthy communities
4651720 we have heard from both staff and clients what a difference this new facility has made in enhancing the support that staff provide to clients in need of addictions services
4651721 i guess if anybody would know whats not in the fundamental interests of newfoundland and labrador its stephen harper because he reneged on his promise regarding offshore oil revenues and worked against our interest by breaking a 10 billion promise and people wont forget that
4651722 i also personally dont forget the comment he made to me in a private meeting where he said we the federal conservative party dont need newfoundland and labrador to win this country
4651723 a couple of years ago we had a great budget our first really wonderful budget in this province and i remember him harper standing up in the house of commons mocking that budget and brought tory mp fabian manning down deliberately to sit next to him
4651724 this election is not going to be decided strictly on the green shift from the green shift perspective newfoundland and labrador is still waiting to see where all the cards are going to fall
4651725 these plans have been somewhat developed but i dont think they have been fully mapped out we have yet to see a full conservative platform on the environment i think what stephen harper is trying to do is basically position this as a one issue federal election and hope he can beat stephane dion and or others on that were not going to be drawn into that
4651726 the liberal carbon tax will have a huge impact on seniors and people with fixed incomes who cant afford to pay more for basics like heating their homes and buying groceries
4651727 people in rural newfoundland and labrador will be hit even harder with costs of trucking goods into their communities going through the roof
4651728 all of these groups need strong voices to stand up for them at all levels of government to make sure the cost of heating homes buying groceries and driving kids to soccer doesnt become out of reach our government has reduced taxes significantly since taking office and in the next election conservative candidates across the province will fight against liberal plans to raise them again thats in the best interest of newfoundlanders and labradorians who are working hard to get ahead
4651729 its a separate issue and i dont think for one minute it will have any affect
4651730 this is not about getting my guy or gal in place who is going to follow my wishes when it comes to grenfell well work with the administration the president and the new chancellor rick hillier and hopefully we can finally deliver what were trying to achieve for grenfell
4651731 up until now gorse court has accommodated any resident and kids used to hang around the front porches and things like that
4651732 we talked to the tenants and the housing office and felt if we had one of the buildings at dunfield park designated for seniors only and put secure doorways at the front that would be a big step forward
4651733 dunfield park was among one of the earliest public housing properties built in newfoundland and labrador
4651734 todays announcement marks one of the first significant investments of government funding in decades it reflects our governments commitment to invest in our provinces infrastructure communities and people
4651735 we know its part of a larger revitalization plan so were optimistic were going to see some of the housing needs of the city of corner brook addressed particularly in terms of the need for a significant number of smaller apartments for single individuals couples families with just one child and that sort of thing
4651736 that seems to be the biggest demand in this city right now and i think the overall plan will certainly address that
4651737 were getting complaints from at least one area resident down there who is getting shook out of his bed every morning with trucks passing by

4651745 contained within that compound were very large reels of different types of copper wire
4651746 several different types of wire were stolen there was a couple of hundred metres of each type of wire gone
4651747 we experienced the theft of about 1 000 metres of cable thats cable that would have had in inventory
4651748 we reported the theft to our own internal security and the local authorities are also involved
4651749 although it can impact our business our main focus of concern is ensuring our infrastructure is available to us so service to our customers isnt impacted
4651750 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4651751 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4651752 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4651753 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4651754 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4651820 knowingly and intentionally sought to conceal and cover up his receipt of things of value by filing financial disclosure forms that contained false statements and omissions
4651821 senator stevens accepted gifts from a privately held company called veco
4651822 a new viking gas range a tool storage cabinet and an automobile exchange in which senator stevens received a new vehicle worth far more than what he provided in exchange
4651823 these items were not disclosed on senator stevens financial disclosure forms which he filed under penalties of perjury either as gifts or as liabilities
4651824 his official position and his office on behalf of veco
4651825 at the same time that senator stevens was receiving these things of value over that same time period he was also being solicited by veco to do certain things which he or his staff on occasion did the indictment does not allege a quid pro quo bribery is not charged in this case bribery requires proof of a specific agreement of a quid pro quo this for that this indictment does not allege such an agreement
4651826 it saddens me to learn that these charges have been brought against me i have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a u s senator
4651827 i am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that
4651828 ive known ted stevens for 28 years and ive always known him to be impeccably honest
4651829 i dont know that theres a stronger comment to be made than that
4651830 hes a hero and a fighter hes been a fighter for this countrys interests and a fighter for his state ever since and a strong leader in the senate so all i can say is i hope that this will turn out fairly and consistent with the law
4651831 we bring cases when they are ready to be charged and thats what happened here

4651851 there is no price tag for the love of learning
4651852 its common sense for students to earn good grades in order to better their opportunities in life
4651853 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4651854 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4651855 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4651856 tidur disurau sana letih sangat lepas sembahyang baring baring terus terlelap jawabnya
4651857 huh kamu tidur langsung tak sedar macam orang dah tak mahu hidup lagi
4651858 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
4651859 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
4651860 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
4651861 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
4651862 the no 1 issue is lets get the long term tax credit in place now so that my friend john doerr in silicon valley can put money into renewable energy and create jobs
4651863 al gore wants to go to the batteries and thats fine with me but we are not going to make a big cut in 10 years without natural gas
4651864 natural gas is a bridge to batteries and hydrogen it will give you 20 years until you get the right battery and hydrogen technologies
4651865 america faces a choice a continuation of the bush cheney mccain approach that perpetuates the failed policies that have produced soaring prices or a comprehensive bipartisan strategy that develops new and traditional sources of energy
4651866 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4651867 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4651868 our party faces an extraordinary challenge and public opinion is flowing against us right now
4651869 the mood of the country is as negative as weve ever seen it
4651870 we dont need three presidents and thats what you would have if hillary was picked barack hillary and bill
4651871 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4651872 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4651873 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4651874 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4651875 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4651876 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4651877 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4651878 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4651879 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4651880 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4651881 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4651882 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4651883 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4651884 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4651885 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4651886 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4651887 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4651888 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4651889 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4651890 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4651891 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4651892 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4651893 the vice presidential picks are more important than ever before because both candidates are not entirely complete
4651894 mccain needs economic expertise and physical energy obama needs experience and gravitas
4651895 you must first connect to itunes with an internet connection to enable youtube

4651900 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4651901 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4651902 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4651903 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4651904 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4651905 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4651906 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4651907 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4651908 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4651909 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4651910 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4651911 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4651912 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4651913 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4651914 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4651915 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4651916 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4651917 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4651918 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4651919 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4651920 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4651921 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4651922 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4651923 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4651924 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4651925 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4651926 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4651927 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4651928 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4651929 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4651930 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4651931 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4651932 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4651933 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4651934 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4651935 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4651936 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4651937 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4651938 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4651939 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4651940 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4651941 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4651942 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
4651943 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4651944 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4651945 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4651946 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4651947 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4651948 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4651949 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4651950 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4651951 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4651952 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4651953 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4651954 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4651955 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4651956 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4651957 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4651958 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4651959 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4651960 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4651961 the action is surprising the community in blackburn is mainstream any act of terrorism not only does it give a bad name to islam and muslims it has an adverse reaction on race relations
4651962 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve i would ask local residents to be patient with us
4651963 its quite disturbing its a small street and everyone gets on with everybody for this to happen here is quite shocking
4651964 they keep themselves to themselves they dont speak the father speaks but the sons dont
4651965 at the same time you are my enemy we really dont accept this kind of logic
4651966 does not recognize the legitimacy or validity of these proceedings and therefore does not wish any defense counsel to do anything that purports to be on his behalf
4651967 it seems extraordinary to imagine that four u s agents whod gone to pick her up two military two fbi along with at least two afghan translators were somehow surprised by this woman who overpowered them grabbed a gun flipped the safety fired off a couple of shots and then could only be subdued by shots to the torso
4651968 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4651969 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4651970 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4651971 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4651972 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4651973 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4651974 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4651975 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4651976 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4651977 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4651978 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4651979 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4651980 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4651981 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4651982 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4651983 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4651984 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4651985 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4651986 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4651987 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4651988 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4651989 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4651990 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4651991 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4651992 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4651993 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4651994 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4651995 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4651996 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4651997 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4651998 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4651999 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4652000 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4652001 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4652002 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4652003 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4652004 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4652005 many in the christian right tend to get their information

4652007 i regard 0d here as my home and the people as my people
4652008 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4652009 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4652010 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4652011 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4652012 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4652013 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4652014 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4652017 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4652018 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4652019 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4652020 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4652021 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4652022 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4652023 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4652024 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4652025 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4652026 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4652027 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4652028 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4652029 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4652030 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4652031 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4652032 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4652033 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4652034 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4652035 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4652036 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4652037 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though

4652044 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4652045 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4652046 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4652047 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4652048 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4652049 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4652050 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4652051 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4652052 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4652053 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4652054 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4652055 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4652056 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4652057 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4652058 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
4652059 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
4652060 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
4652061 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
4652062 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
4652063 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
4652064 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
4652065 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
4652066 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
4652067 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
4652068 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4652069 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4652070 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4652071 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4652072 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4652073 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4652074 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4652075 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4652076 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4652077 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4652078 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4652079 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4652080 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4652081 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4652082 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4652083 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4652084 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4652085 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4652086 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4652087 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4652088 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4652089 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4652090 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4652091 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4652092 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4652093 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4652094 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4652095 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4652096 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4652097 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4652098 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4652099 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4652100 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4652101 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4652102 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4652103 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4652104 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4652105 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4652106 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4652107 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4652108 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4652109 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4652110 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4652111 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4652112 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4652113 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4652114 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4652115 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4652116 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4652117 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4652118 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4652119 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4652120 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4652121 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4652122 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4652123 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4652124 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4652125 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4652126 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4652127 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4652128 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4652129 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4652130 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4652131 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4652132 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4652133 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4652134 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4652135 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4652136 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4652137 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4652138 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4652139 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4652140 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4652141 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4652142 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4652143 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4652144 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4652145 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4652146 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4652147 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4652148 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4652149 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4652150 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
4652151 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
4652152 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
4652153 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
4652154 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
4652155 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
4652156 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
4652157 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4652158 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4652159 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4652160 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4652161 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4652162 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4652163 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4652164 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

4652167 au nom de dieu le cl ment le mis ricordieux
4652168 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4652169 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4652170 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4652171 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now

4652213 the day was not about driving these cars fast but understanding how and when to use their capability in a safe way
4652214 this was an important element ensuring officers understood the theory behind the vehicles capability the day was not about driving these cars fast but understanding how and when to use their capability in a safe way
4652215 these traffic officers are already professionally trained using the police roadcraft training manual so we focussed the day on teaching them the different techniques required in setting up the four wheel drive impreza for corners including methods of braking and how and when to use the traction control system to best effect
4652216 it wasnt about making them faster drivers but rather ensuring that they could maintain control in all conditions
4652217 the officers came away with a much better understanding of how best to use the different driving dynamics of high performance four wheel drive cars like the impreza our officers training and driving techniques are based largely on the police roadcraft manual what the team at prodrive showed was just what can be achieved in these cars through the use of driving techniques specific to the vehicles this has given my officers additional skills and the confidence to safely apply them on the road during a pursuit
4652218 i recall the new wrx was a heavier car so the same 227 230hp motor might feel slower

4652266 near a packed football stadium using an explosive attached to his body
4652267 the way the attack was conducted is very much similar to previous attacks throughout the years at el al counters therefore unfortunately given this history we presume that it may and would appear to be a terrorist attack
4652268 the terrorists deliberately chose the fourth of july to carry out their crime on the soil of the united states
4652269 there is no indication of any terrorism connection in this matter

4652273 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4652274 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all

4652278 mankind will become one with the architect of the universe
4652279 i think from a residents point of view they are sort of invisible
4652280 i think that they are often seen by management as invisible too they dont get attention unless theres a problem
4652281 i will forever be grateful to elderly housekeeping staff who went through bins of unwashed laundry and found my ring
4652282 for a lot of them its about how they smell housekeeping keeps the place smelling such that mom and dad would be willing to go there
4652283 if you really want to know who the resident is as a person ask the housekeeper
4652284 if you look at residents in nursing homes probably the closest person to the resident is the housekeeper because theyre in the room every day
4652285 theyre not invading personal space in terms of doing personal care so typically residents are more comfortable talking to housekeepers
4652286 anything that you do that helps to enrich the life of the staff i think plays back in terms of better care for the older person
4652287 its not necessarily throwing more money at them its making them feel more important
4652288 the money doesnt mean as much to them as being listened to
4652289 with my old timers thats especially true the fact they are being listened to and their opinion is valued means a tremendous amount to them
4652290 some have had the opportunity to go somewhere else and they have opted to stay here that tells me they feel appreciated
4652291 in my perfect world theyd come back and wed decide if were going to bring the resident in based on the housekeepers decisions
4652292 the idea is to make the decisions by those who are closest to the residents
4652293 it seems like the housekeeping and laundry staff are well received by residents because theyre not seen as threatening
4652294 the residents will tend to talk to the environmental services employees a little bit more and will have time to spend
4652295 so we are in fact recognizing them as being trainable as being more a part of the lives than most people would like to give them credit for
4652296 it goes to show that we are trying to do the best that we can to make them happy
4652297 by incorporating them into the holistic approach of what they do here it makes them feel they have more meaning than cleaning a bathroom or mopping a floor
4652298 because they are committed to working with elders in the nursing home
4652299 they are my aunts uncles and grandparents and my kids
4652300 they just think youre dealing with clothes and stuff but they dont realize you have to keep up with 131 residents clothes and if one comes up missing you have to pretty much search the whole building

4652362 you would normally expect the mortgage rate to follow the term deposit rate downwards
4652363 its funny earlier this week we heard that one of the reasons banks could not cut mortgage rates was the high returns being paid to savers
4652364 now we are seeing savings rates falling and the banks still arent cutting rates they are running out of excuses
4652365 its classic profiteering the banks think everybody is keeping a close eye on mortgage rates and has forgotten about savings rates and credit cards
4652366 as for raising their credit card rates now you can make your own mind up about that there is simply no excuse
4652367 we take any changes to interest rates very seriously taking into account the total cost of funds competitive pressures and impact on customers these are the factors behind this particular card interest rate change

4652376 its impossible to clone extinct animals like some people claim they will do with frozen mammoths thats fantasy not science
4652377 we were very interested in finding out a little bit more about this iconic australian carnivore especially since we humans were responsible for its extinction
4652378 this study has given us proof that one can ask these sorts of questions and get answers
4652379 if you had a very hairy african elephant that would be a first step to looking like a mammoth but of course it wouldnt be a mammoth it would just be a weird looking elephant
4652380 to use an animal model is always difficult but to use an eutherian placental animal model for a marsupial is really quite risky
4652381 cell cultures or the mouse models are the only possibility we have of learning how non coding dna worked in extinct animals the question is not whether this is the best way forward its the only way forward

4652400 after the sadly premature death of sir eldon gorst lord kitchener was appointed in his stead
4652401 great britain had been opposed to the construction of the suez canal which opened a new and shorter route to india to the mediterranian powers its completion made the fate of egypt largely dependent on the will of the leading sea power britain in 1857 lord beaconsfield disraeli purchased with the aid of the rothschilds 176 602 original founders shares from the financially embarrassed khedive england having thus acquired a definite stake in the country was bound to intervene both in the management of the canal and in the organization of egyptian finance the problem of ottoman egypt like ottoman turkey itself was one of indebtedness to the european powers primarily france and england the khedive like the sultan was heavily in debt and having become financially embarrassed was forced to sell his shares but not necessarily to lord beaconsfield in 1875 the khedive was deposed by the sultan of turkey in 1879 with anarchy resulting under his successor tewfik with military mutiny inspired partly by the very real grievances against foreign usurers and corrupt officials great britain intervened on behalf of the khedive and restored order at tel el kebir in 1882 there were indeed several occassions on which her statesmen contemplated the withdrawal of the army of occupation but after the failure of the anglo turkish negotiations of 1886 1887 it was recognised that this could only be effected if at all after many years inspite of the jealousy of france whose politicians had allowed themselves to be manoeuvered into an attitude of hostility towards england by germany the hostility of reactionary elements and of the khedive abbas ii who succeeded his father tewfik in 1892 the financial bondage in which egypt was held by international jealousies the abuse and the fact that none of the great powers had definitely recognised our special position and interests in egypt our influence increased six years later came the anglo french agreement of happy augury by which france in return for concessions in morocco and elsewhere recognised englands special interests in egypt while england undertook to make no change in the political status of the country the other european powers except of course turkey some sooner some later recognised the occupation
4652402 the khediveate was hereditary in the house of muhammad ali according to the law of primogeniture but the same firman debarred the khedive from the raising of loans without the consent of the sultan and of keeping an army of more than 18 000 men in time of peace nor could he conclude any treaty beyond certain commercial conventions with any foreign power at the sublime porte egypt was regarded as an autonomous ottoman province ruled by an hereditary govenor general appointed by the sultan though possessed of greater independence than other ottoman valis
4652403 not till 1900 when the grand orient virtually took over the young turk party which was composed chiefly of jews greeks and armenians did this movement assume a serious aspect
4652404 the acacia october 1908 a secret young turk council was formed and the whole movement was directed from salonica salonica the most jewish town in europe 70 000 jews out of a population of 100 000 was specially suited for the purpose it already contained several lodges in which the revolutionaries could work without being disturbed these lodges are under the protection of european diplomacy and as the sultan was without weapons against them his fall was inevitable on the 1st may 1909 the representatives of 45 turkish lodges met in constantinople and founded the grand orient ottoman mahmoud orphi pasha was nominated grand master a short time after a supreme council of the ancient and accepted scottish rites was also founded and recognised by the french and italian authorities
4652405 we may add that two of the salonica lodges those of macedonia and labour amp lux were connected with the grand orient of italy and france
4652406 the last hour shall not occur until 70 000 of the children of isaac shall attack it when they will come to it they will land down but they will not fight with arms nor shower it with arrows they will only say there is no god but allah and allah is the greatest and one of its sides will fall they will recite it for the second time there is no god but allah and allah is the greatest and another side of the city will fall afterwards they will recite for a third time there is no god but allah and allah is the greatest and then it will be opened to them and they will enter it and acquire booty while they will be dividing the spoils a proclaimer will come to them and say verily dajjal anti christ has come out then they will leave everything and return
4652407 within six years look to the great war then after one more year the emergence of the dajjal or anti christ and revolution which would enter every arab house followed by mutual hostility between the arabs
4652408 in european turkey the spanish jews or sephardim as they call themselves found two conditions essential for their prosperity a benevolent government and a country in a low state of economic development they settled in the chief commercial centres constantinople uskub sarajevo and above all salonika and rapidly supplanted greeks venetians genoese and ragusans
4652409 the settlement of the sephardim in rumelia was a noteworthy epoch in the history of the jews for it marked the first retracing of their steps in the direction of zion but these sephardim never girded themselves for the final stages of the road
4652410 salonika with its 80 000 jews 70 000 on page 11 vol xii speaking their inherited spanish dialect was already a jewish home and who could expect a jew with his history of wandering behind him to abandon lightly so fair an asylum loyalty and material interest combined to make the sephardim stay where they were and stand by the turks they became linked to the turks more intimately through a crypto jewish moslem community the d nme descended from sephardim converted in the seventeenth century
4652411 the d nme were represented by turkeys finance minister djavid bey the financier on the committee of union and progress and through oriental free masonry which they controlled the salonika sephardim were associated from the beginning with the young turkish movement in turkey as in hungary and from the same mixed motives of gratitude and ambition they threw in their lot with the ruling race and they supplied the intellectual element in the new turkish nationalism
4652412 the author of the standard exposition of the pan turanian movement who calls himself by the pure turkish name of tekin alp is believed to have been a salonika jew and there is also reason to suppose that the secularising anti islamic tendency which is so remarkable a feature in pan turanianism was partly the effect of this jewish influence
4652413 nevlinski believes that the sultans only salvation lies in an alliance with the young turks who for their part are on good terms with the macedonians cretans armenians etc and in putting through reforms with their help he had given this counsel to the sultan in a report i theodor herzl said that in addition to this program he should provide with jewish help the means to carry it out
4652414 let the sultan give us that parcel of land palestine and in return we would set his house in order regulate his finances and influence world opinion in his favour
4652415 unprepared as i was i merely said to him that we were figuring that we could give some 20 million pounds for palestine we devoted 20 million turkish pounds towards the regularisation of the turkish finances of that sum we give two millions in exchange for palestine the amount being based on a capitalisation of its present annual revenue t80 000 with the remaining 18 millions we free turkey from the european controlled commission
4652416 the first four categories of bond holders are induced by the privileges we grant them viz increased rates of interest extension of amortisation period etc to agree to the suppression of the commission
4652417 banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them with the power to create credit and with a flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it all back again take this power away from them and all the great fortunes like mine would disappear and they ought to disappear for then this world would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery then continue to let bankers control money and control credit

4652424 as the father of three girls ive had to ask myself why i let my eldest one get an unproven vaccine against a few strains of a nonlethal virus that can be dealt with in many more effective ways its not like they are at high risk it was the regrettable acceptance of the vaccine party line that mis led me
4652425 we still recommend the vaccine and feel it is an important vaccine for the health of women there are about 20 million people currently infected with hpv women have an 80 percent chance of developing hpv by the time they are 50 hpv is most common in people in their late teens and early 20s because the vaccine is a preventative and not a cure it is important that the vaccine be given prior to beginning sexual activity about 11 000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer and 3 600 will die this vaccine prevents four viruses that account for about 70 percent of cervical cancers

4652491 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4652492 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4652493 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4652494 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4652495 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4652516 we have the ability so we will try to develop and achieve even better results than we did last season
4652517 i believe we can do it because even though we have no new signings we havent lost any players either which is the most important thing
4652518 hes doing very well hes well ahead of schedule and the specialists were surprised with the condition that hes in
4652519 for the next three weeks hell be on rehabilitation then endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side with us

4652523 for me personally i dont consider it a risk playing at old trafford because ive got to play my first match somewhere so why not sunday
4652524 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong
4652525 i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4652526 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season there are three or four other clubs who have good teams like tottenham and portsmouth who are strong teams
4652527 i saw manchester city in the uefa cup and just because they lost doesnt mean they are not a good team
4652528 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games
4652529 here you can never be sure you will win a game and that is exciting every week you have a new challenge
4652530 one week you will be playing a team like portsmouth who have a lot of tall players the next a team where everyone is fast
4652531 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward he played well in the friendly games but he is quiet
4652532 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4652533 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
4652534 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4652535 i had some opportunities to sell players but they wouldnt go
4652536 theyre probably in the comfort zone here and are quite happy not to be in the team but to do their little bit and plod along really

4652542 gps can manage patients confidently without exposing them to increased risks and costs associated with nsaids or
4652543 it is very likely that for many patients with acute low back pain currently treated with nsaids and or spinal manipulation this would not have been needed if adequate first line treatment with paracetamol and advice and reassurance was given
4652544 for most people providing simple care and advice should guide the patient through their acute phase of pain and allow them to return to normal life when that acute phase is over
4652545 spinal manipulation is just part of a package of care offered by bca chiropractors which also includes lifestyle and posture advice rehabilitation and specific exercises
4652546 we know that many gps feel ill equipped to help patients with low back pain and sometimes people are not given the right advice and reassurance when they first see a gp

4652554 it isnt the first time mobs of angry people have burned cars and looted shops but somehow it seems distinct from montreals other riots maybe its the undercurrent of racial tension that seemed to run through the destruction all riots start with a public united by a sense of injustice in this case it was frustration and anger directed against a police force and municipal authorities that seem to treat montreals minorities and in particular blacks latinos and arabs with contempt suspicion and at times violence
4652555 in the past montreal north was notoriously corrupt and relations between police and the community have always been tense even before the growth of its non white and immigrant populations these days it is plagued by street gangs that have had great success in recruiting young men who face dire prospects in schools and the job market police will have a hard time preventing recruitment when they have such little credibility in yesterdays gazette columnist henry aubin excoriated the municipal and provincial governments for ignoring the appallingly high unemployment rate among young montrealers born in latin american and the caribbean and for having such a flimsy record of minority hiring just 5 6 percent of montreals police officers and 0 5 percent of its firefighters are non white moreover the city and province seem reluctant to establish an impartial panel to look into villanuevas death choosing instead to put quebecs public security ministry in charge of investigating the shooting

4652560 twenty years ago this would have been a laughable effort
4652561 pittsburgh has a long way to go but were making good progress
4652562 theres clearly some work we need to do in our police bureau
4652563 although attitudes are changing in pittsburgh its still not as friendly as it could be
4652564 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4652565 once again people are closing their eyes to the reality and creating myths i did not make a strong statement because i refuse to accept this widespread simplified interpretation which paints the georgians as the victims and the russians as the villains that is a gross oversimplification of the situation and i would have to write a lengthy article to explain why i do not share this view
4652566 this is a long term problem in the countrys foreign policy and unfortunately it does not come as a surprise czech foreign policy suffers from a lack of coordination especially in times of big international crisis when different politicians and institutions in the country speak with different voices we can of course argue about which stance is correct in this particular situation but at the same time i think that the czech republic should have a mechanism which would allow it to reach a unified stance on crises such as this one
4652567 talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4652568 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4652569 of course there isnt power sharing right now but the talks are still going on
4652570 until we find a solution they will continue to go on because sadc doesnt have the luxury of walking away from
4652571 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4652572 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4652573 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4652574 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4652575 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4652576 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4652577 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4652578 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4652579 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4652580 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4652581 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4652582 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4652583 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4652584 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4652585 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4652586 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4652587 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4652588 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4652589 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4652590 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4652591 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4652592 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4652593 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4652594 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4652595 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4652596 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4652597 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4652598 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4652599 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4652600 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4652601 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4652602 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4652603 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4652604 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4652605 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4652606 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4652607 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4652608 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4652609 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4652610 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4652611 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4652612 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4652613 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4652614 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4652615 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4652616 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4652617 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4652618 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4652619 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4652620 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4652621 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4652622 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4652623 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4652624 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4652625 who are open to doing something on the production side
4652626 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4652627 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4652628 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4652629 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4652630 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4652631 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4652632 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4652633 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4652634 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4652635 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4652636 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4652637 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4652638 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4652639 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4652640 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4652641 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4652642 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4652643 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4652644 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4652645 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4652646 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4652647 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4652648 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4652649 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4652650 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4652651 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4652652 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4652653 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4652654 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4652655 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4652656 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4652657 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4652658 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4652659 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4652660 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4652661 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4652662 we missed out on the fa cup final last season so this time we will try to win every trophy

4652728 as humans we are born in the trust of loving and in being loved within an ecology of the natural world and within the larger living cosmos
4652729 words are not trivial words are the nodes or elements of networks of conversation
4652730 a key question is how in a human system living what it is living does pain and suffering arise from that manner of living culture is a network of conversations that both generates and conserves states and manners of living and co existence even painful ones

4652738 being depressed is still filled with lots of stigma and anguish

4652740 i mean you can get a prescription for a good generic medication from a doctor for as little as 4 at wal mart thats not much compared with calling in sick several days a month or showing up and not producing

4652813 it not infrequently happens that something about the earth about the sky about other elements of this world about the motion and rotation or even the magnitude and distances of the stars about definite eclipses of the sun and moon about the passage of years and seasons about the nature of animals of fruits of stones and of other such things may be known with the greatest certainty by reasoning or by experience even by one who is not a christian it is too disgraceful and ruinous though and greatly to be avoided that he the non christian should hear a christian speaking so idiotically on these matters and as if in accord with christian writings that he might say that he could scarcely keep from laughing when he saw how totally in error they are in view of this and in keeping it in mind constantly while dealing with the book of genesis i have insofar as i was able explained in detail and set forth for consideration the meanings of obscure passages taking care not to affirm rashly some one meaning to the prejudice of another and perhaps better explanation
4652814 there may be a problem with this appointment because its been done in a recess

4652824 she keeps the cows head held high and when she walks it she goes very slowly so it appears like the calf is gliding
4652825 in some cases theyve worked with their animal for years
4652826 a lot of effort goes into this and it all comes down to this one day

4652850 between insulting statements and condemnations that border on slander recent electoral activity by the u s presidential candidates has focused on their proposals for energy policy and while the scandalous part is the repeated changes in positions and posturing of the two candidates what is most regrettable is the populist spirit of their electoral proposals
4652851 last week he announced that he now supports the limited extraction of oil in areas along the u s coast until now preserved from exploitation until this latest amendment obama had opposed this type of oil extraction arguing that coastal drilling entails a risk to the environment so great that the nation could not allow it
4652852 mccain meanwhile has not distinguished himself by his consistency the arizona senator has also had radical change in his stance on the subject of increasing coastal drilling in fact during the primary elections of 2000 mccain transformed himself into the best advocate of the environmental cause emphasizing that that the existing ban on coastal drilling should be extended in recent weeks mccain has taken up the desperate cause of bush and vice president dick cheney in a very visible campaign to discredit congress and require it to permit oil exploration off the coast

4652865 yes i met her through salman she had a fresh face and she suited the role also she has a great memory even though she wasnt well versed in the language she used to mug her lines very well
4652866 because of salman she got to work with the right people and in the right manner i will give full credit to salman and his family for providing her with shelter professional advice and guidance
4652867 they are a part of the social circle that i move in they are tremendously wonderful people

4652869 we wanted to beat them more than we did last time
4652870 i lobbied vigorously that our district district 5 western addition and surrounding area be the first in the city to pilot the crime cameras
4652871 if there are going to be city cameras out there then it better be city cameras that one work well and work effectively and actually do the job that i think was what they were intended to do
4652872 in california if youre convicted of murder 25 to life means youre going to die in prison
4652873 they said after the decedent fell on the ground my client continued to punch him in the face they said my client kicked him and stomped on his face with his feet and when you look at the video you see none of that happened
4652874 without these cameras we had witnesses that gave false statements and my client no doubt would still be in jail facing murder charges
4652875 our interest here is discerning the facts and what happened and we have to go where the evidence leads us
4652876 at the time the case was initially charged the video that was presented was raw footage we later received an enhanced copy of that videotape that allowed us to be able to discern many more of the facts and the circumstances around what was happening and therefore based on that evidence we had to amend the charges
4652877 the cameras apparently are not being used like the police thought theyd be used to help convict people but i think justice is not about convicting people justice is about finding the truth and in this case the cameras found the truth
4652878 the owner said he was prepared to temporarily close the restaurant after the heaviest rains for 50 years brought floods to the city but he had a change of heart when he heard how the eaterys new wet look was bringing in the customers

4652888 officials will seek donations abroad and aim to raise 21bn 11bn by 2021
4652889 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4652890 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4652891 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4652892 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4652893 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4652894 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4652895 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4652896 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4652897 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4652898 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4652899 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4652900 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4652901 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4652902 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4652903 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4652904 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4652905 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4652906 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4652907 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4652911 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4652912 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4652913 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4652914 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4652915 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4652916 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4652917 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4652918 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4652919 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4652920 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4652921 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4652922 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4652923 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4652924 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4652925 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4652926 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4652927 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4652928 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4652929 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4652939 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4652940 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4652941 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4652942 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4652943 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4652944 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4652945 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4652946 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4652947 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4652953 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4652954 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4652955 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4652956 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4652957 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4652958 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4652959 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4652960 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4652961 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4652962 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4652963 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4652964 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4652965 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4652966 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4652967 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4652968 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4652969 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4652970 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4652971 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4652972 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
4652973 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4652974 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
4652975 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4652976 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4652977 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4652978 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4652979 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4652980 our expanded research effort has led to several significant strides in the development of cellulosic ethanol technology at the lab scale in recent months
4652981 in the past few months our scientists have been able to achieve significant ethanol percentages in fermentation and improve the yield of ethanol from biomass additionally in our work with farmers and agricultural equipment manufacturers we had a very successful harvest of corn cobs last fall and anticipate further advances during an expanded harvest this fall
4652982 there is a realistic prospect of obtaining additional working capital and we believe managements roadmap toward resolving this liquidity crisis by year end is credible therefore at this point we do not foresee bankruptcy or some other drastic outcome
4652983 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
4652984 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4652985 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4652986 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4652987 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4652988 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4652989 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4652990 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4652991 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4652992 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4652993 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4652994 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4652995 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4652996 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4652997 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4652998 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4652999 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4653000 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4653001 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4653002 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4653003 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4653004 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4653005 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4653006 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4653007 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4653008 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4653009 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4653010 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4653011 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4653012 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4653013 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4653014 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4653015 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4653016 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4653017 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4653018 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4653019 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4653020 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4653021 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4653022 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4653023 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4653024 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4653025 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4653026 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4653027 was it at all daunting for you to transform this wildly popular film into an equally loveable stage version
4653028 actor brian darcy james figures it took him about 2 hours and 15 minutes to make his first transformation into the title character of shrek the musical
4653029 well streamline it a bit more as we move forward

4653036 er is met de grootst mogelijke zorg door vier radiologen en twee orthopedisch chirurgen naar gekeken maar op de eerste scans was niets te zien

4653047 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4653048 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4653049 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4653050 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4653051 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4653052 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4653053 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4653054 it is a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died she gave her life in service to our city
4653055 a superhuman effort by 30 strangers who lifted the vehicle off her body miraculously saved her baby before she died
4653056 we did not really communicate we all just started lifting we lifted it up and someone pulled her out
4653057 yeah i just invented a new money making scheme id like several billion pounds in funding
4653058 the wizzard media player allows for unprecedented producer control and customization it incorporates all of the best features i have seen in other web video players and several that are innovative and unique
4653059 i expect a surge of content producers moving to this media player it has been my pleasure to work with wizzard in the development of a media player that exceeds my own lofty expectations it is exactly what i was looking for
4653060 from what we can tell they appear to be in relatively good condition good spirits
4653061 theyve now returned to the base at mount cook theyre being assessed by medical staff but given what theyve been through they appear to be in remarkably good spirits
4653062 there was a brief window in the weather this morning and a helicopter was able to go directly to the location where the beacon was set off from and find the missing party of australian climbers
4653063 the difficulty was because the type of beacon they were using was an older variety of beacon it didnt give us any information about who had activated it
4653064 so it was difficult for us to know if it was them that is an area that is popular with a number of climbers
4653065 its this sort of joy ride or early development of flight that led to things like airlines and intercontinental travel trips that take a day to travel across the world
4653066 this will be the first american military installation in the former communist bloc which will also be close to the russian border
4653067 deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4653068 by hosting these weapons poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent
4653069 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4653070 russia should not make an immediate military response by deploying short range iskander missiles or other systems on the polish border
4653071 russia is so compromised in the eyes of the west that if it wants to keep the winter olympics at sochi and sign an agreement with the world trade organisation it will have to show restraint and realism
4653072 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4653073 he was driving way too fast and was stopped by police
4653074 another one i believe he had an altercation with his eye doctor and the third one i am aware of is one where basically he got into an altercation with an umpire at a t ball game
4653075 the only thing different about me is that i cant breastfeed my baby but a lot of mothers dont
4653076 really what youre trying to do is lose a little weight so you can gain it back
4653077 but when you deprive yourself you typically compensate by eating way too much later and take in more calories than you banked
4653078 well why should i help you you cheated off ashlys test yesterday
4653079 robert some day you are going to be a minister yes you are going to be a minister and a very good one at that in fact i believe that someday you will be influencing thousands of people for god
4653080 the superiority of technology of the dominant culture is saving you
4653081 computers do have a use in long range language preservation
4653082 i feel like right now i still havent given up i feel like id still go back out there because its a lifelong dream to be here
4653083 you dream of going the whole way to represent ourselves and our country its so disappointing right now im proud of the girls im proud of everything but its tough
4653084 but to lose the quarter finals in the olympics its a little hard to accept right now
4653085 it has been a wonderful nine years for me my family and the program
4653086 there has been development of the team and the program in canada
4653087 i hoped my team would finish with a good performance and a win in my last game we seemed to run out of gas early in the second half we kept fighting and we created a war but we couldnt play the good performances we have played before they worked hard as they can i have no problem with the results
4653088 we came in we played great in the tournament we had high hopes and to face the u s we definitely felt that this could have been our turn
4653089 erin and i are best friends on the team and i never wanted to see her hurt
4653090 at the same time i was like what can i do to help
4653091 el a o pasado hicimos una campa a contra la discriminaci n con un hombre negro un coreano y un boliviano la campa a peg bien y este a o decidimos seguir la misma l nea cuando le empec a contar a wanda c mo era el proyecto 2008 ella me tir la idea me encant pero la verdad es que todo sali bien de casualidad

4653099 after having been an occupied nation for over 150 years we have asked the united states government to leave our country meanwhile until the united states government leaves lakotah territory we will take every opportunity to insist it follow its own laws and that its states do the same
4653100 will i use it for penetration clitoral stimulation or both
4653101 i think the russian leadership knows exactly where president bush and the united states and the international community stand
4653102 but when the president speaks hes sending a signal to the rest of the world also sending a signal especially to countries that have recently transitioned to democracy that the united states will stand with you and to stay strong
4653103 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians
4653104 but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4653105 the cessation of hostilities announced by moscow has not yet reflected particularly into any improvement in terms of access for humanitarian aid workers
4653106 we appeal to all sides when we address humanitarian issues

4653138 oh yeah about that hermione already fixed that a long time ago it was a bunch of stuff about a goldeneye and a golden gun and a goldfinger im just chillin

4653152 its a little bit like a run on the bank
4653153 they have to do something before they really start losing partners once that starts its very hard to stop
4653154 certainly a sign that something is wrong and needs to change
4653155 a better than expected year financially and ahead of where the firm was last year despite a recession
4653156 common wisdom is that its best to drive a merger based on practice and client mix than purely by geography
4653157 especially where the firm is right now we get headhunter calls all the time
4653158 sure theres lots of opportunities out there for us its one of those things you just have to take on a day by day basis
4653159 but put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires
4653160 so flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the lord from a pure heart
4653161 all things are lawful for me but not all things are helpful
4653162 all things are lawful but not all things are helpful all things are lawful but not all things build up
4653163 all things are lawful for me but i will not be enslaved by anything
4653164 so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of god
4653165 i try to please everyone in everything i do not seeking my own advantage but that of many that they may be saved
4653166 give no offense to jews or to greeks or to the church of god
4653167 therefore if food makes my brother stumble i will never eat meat lest i make my brother stumble
4653168 therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother
4653169 we put no obstacle in anyones way so that no fault may be found within our authority
4653170 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick who can understand it
4653171 test everything hold on to the good avoid every kind of evil
4653172 jesus i will forsake my home family and future but dont ask me to give up my favorite tv show
4653173 fairness is not giving each child what they want or even giving each child the same thing fairness is giving each child what they need
4653174 hmmmmm i think maybe miss know it all needs a bite of humble pie i shall give it to her in this package
4653175 she will love this child more than life itself she will be overwhelmed by her beauty and in awe of her intelligence her humor and her girliness she will thank me regularly for the gift of a daughter
4653176 but the child will be demanding from the very beginning and within a couple of years missy will have found herself driven to levels of frustration anger shame and confusion that she has never before experienced she will be amazed at how bewildering one little girl can be
4653177 i will see to it that she be humbled daily she will realize just how little she truly knows she will learn how impossible it is to exert control over another person even a very small person
4653178 missy asked me to point out her sin to her in order that she might repent she married a man who is pretty easy to live with so there is less opportunity in her marriage i will give her a daughter to make up for it
4653179 sometimes in responding to her daughters behavior missy will display all her hypocrisy her anger her lack of self control her selfishness and her pride sometimes all in one day sometimes all in five minutes
4653180 but i am a loving father and i will not abandon my daughter missy but i will grow her through her failings
4653181 many times missy will creep into her sleeping daughters room pull her out of her crib and rock her in the dark many nights she will kneel by her bed in prayer and then through her desperate tears she will beg me for wisdom and i will answer her
4653182 when she seeks me she will find me i will show her the way to love our daughter for i love eva rose even more than missy does
4653183 the reason the polls are close is partly because of the sense of antagonism that obama might serve interests other than white interests and the doubt about should you really take a risk on someone who is very different from us
4653184 a huevo por eso el gobierno invierte tan poco en la educaci n uno deja de creer muchas cosas vaya manera de enga ar a un infante
4653185 everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa if you want to talk about players talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4653186 en la reuni n dijo rodelo nos solicitaron un aporte de 85 000 d lares que posteriormente se increment a 135 500 para actividades relacionadas con el acuerdo humanitario lo nico que hice como gerente de mon meros fue cumplir esa orden

4653189 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4653190 recognise the territorial integrity of georgia and recognise that abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia
4653191 tell me a story a new look at real and artificial memory
4653192 recent brain research confirms that optimum brain function and development is still dependent upon storytelling
4653193 stories give life to past experiences stories make events in memory memorable to others and to ourselves
4653194 when a decision making heuristic a rule of thumb is presented to us without a context we cannot decide the validity of the rule we have heard nor do we know where to store this rule in our memories
4653195 the key point here is that once we find a belief and connected story no further processing no search for other beliefs need be done we rarely look to understand a story in more than one way
4653196 the skeletons we use indicate our point of view storytelling causes us to adapt a point of view with this adaptation comes a kind of self definition however we are the stories we tell as we come to rely upon certain skeletons to express what has happened to us we become incapable of seeing the world in any other way the skeletons we use cause specific episodes to conform to one another the more a given skeleton is used the more stories it helps form begin to cohere in memory consequently we develop consistent and rather inflexible points of view
4653197 an incident is remembered in terms of how it is seen in the first place
4653198 a good memory then means an attentive labeling facility during processing or you arent going to remember what you dont find interesting
4653199 yet what we learn is still entirely up to us
4653200 knowing a great deal about a subject means being able to detect differences that will reflect themselves in differences in indexing in other words intelligence depends on clever indexing
4653201 i can live without you i just dont want to

4653213 man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the lord
4653214 who is the best person to help me with this
4653215 well we are no longer cautiously optimistic her back in infected to the bone and the metal the only way to fix it is to do surgery to remove all the hardware and even that might not be enough we can not do the surgery because that will absolutely kill her because she has no stores left to fight off anything or to be able to come off the vent the last time she came off the vent was iffy they are certain she would never come off it if they did another surgery they have her back completely open and no one can live long with an open wound like that at most a few weeks she has been on huge massive big dog antibiotics and they are certain that they will not be able to grow anything from the cultures they took because of that and will not be able to find anything that can fight the infection we are letting her do what she does all we are doing is trying to keep her pain free i can not even begin to tell you all how much pain she has got to be in with this wound on her back nurses were just in for shift change and she is now jaundiced as well just one more sign she is having a lot of episodes of apnea lasting over a minute as well we are praying that she is peaceful and pain free we have all told her to do what she needs to do and that going home with her sister and friends and other relatives is not a bad thing yes we will miss her here greatly but we will see her again soon and when she gets there she will be healed and pain free and able to run and swim and walk and talk and dance and do everything in a whole body once again i thank you all for being wonderful friends and support my dad and his girlfriend are going home tomorrow because mary anne has to be at work monday my mom had gone back and forth about going home but she is going to stay mostly because i asked her to we have no idea how long she will last but we do know that there is no way she is coming back from this one
4653216 instead of building links with communities these laws serve to isolate and frighten people parliament should be defending civil liberties not take them away
4653217 this government has no right to lecture other countries whether be it in the caucasus or the middle east about their civil liberties or human rights records
4653218 wide ranging review of the governments civil liberties record and the effect of the anti terror laws and reverse its policy on 42 day detention
4653219 the government has used mediaeval orders to block their right to return and the islanders are still fighting their case in the house of lords
4653220 im pretty sure its the acne meds causing this and if so well just have to watch to see if it improves while youre not taking it

4653223 i believe in hard work and in staying true to family and friends i believe in giving i was lucky but i always tried to do right by my fans
4653224 i believe passion discipline courage and honor are the fundamentals of life i too have been lucky but win or lose ive always tried to be a true sportsman both on and off the playing fields

4653233 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4653234 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4653235 i get sharper and sharper with each race i do a little bit more confident about exactly what im doing at certain points in the race how to build the race properly
4653236 i dont think we were going to leave china if anyone got us dqed

4653243 i never thought i would see this type of swimming in my life
4653244 this is absolutely going to be something for the ages a hundred years from now people will probably remember this olympics and what team usa did and especially what michael did
4653245 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4653246 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4653247 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready
4653248 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4653249 the owner has come out and said in his own words how he sees the club and where he is with the club and that was a good thing to do because it stopped all this talk of well he is thinking of selling
4653250 what hes saying and i agree with him wholeheartedly is that if we could get two or three more people like him on board we could do this quicker
4653251 we could get where we want to be with the finances we could get and try and get this club back in that top four that is the aim of everyone clubs used to try and win the title now its about trying to get in the top four
4653252 i think we are a long way from there now
4653253 we all understand our roles we all understand what each other briefs are and what each of us brings to the club and that is a good thing thats 100 per cent
4653254 six or seven guys in a room talking about football you are never ever going to agree on everything but the important thing is when we dont agree it stays in the room
4653255 we are very much united as far as i am concerned
4653256 we are really looking to do the right things i do not think we have ever been closer than we are now
4653257 we are trying to get a group of players up to match fitness and that was evident the other night in the uefa cup
4653258 its about doing training at the right time and with the right intensity of work we have made a lot of changes in a short space of time and i suppose it has been a shock for some of the players
4653259 i came into the job with my eyes wide open but im delighted to be here this is a huge club and it needs to be competing at the top of the premier league but that will take time
4653260 howard deans comments on race and gender today are disappointing and wrong his efforts to divide americans are an insult to all our nations citizens and have absolutely no place in the national dialogue

4653289 i think making schools gun free zones was one of the stupidest things ever done on earth
4653290 for those that have read it youll know what i mean but gk reads just like a simon book especially homicide a year on the killing streets or the corner a year in the life of an inner city neighborhood all three novels are true accounts of reporters just transplanting themselves into these completely unknown territories by the end they become part of it in a sense
4653291 the win doesnt change too much really i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
4653292 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races and im really looking forward to that
4653293 i think what surprises me the most is that hes never guested on law amp order criminal intent

4653311 they go to the housekeeper say im sorry i need to get into my room
4653312 theyve already removed this from your doorknob housekeeper comes down lets them in
4653313 he was willing to resign over it to help marla keep her job so it must have been huge i say that because despite his anger for mcnulty and lester and what they did he said he still cared about them
4653314 im going to give this to you in good faith and give you the opportunity to do the right thing but if you dont you cant come back

4653326 we were going for the generic cruiser look you know the kind of bike you cant quite identify without looking at the badge i think we achieved that
4653327 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4653328 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4653329 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4653330 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4653331 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4653332 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4653333 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4653377 deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4653378 by hosting these weapons poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent
4653379 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4653380 russia should not make an immediate military response by deploying short range iskander missiles or other systems on the polish border
4653381 russia is so compromised in the eyes of the west that if it wants to keep the winter olympics at sochi and sign an agreement with the world trade organisation it will have to show restraint and realism
4653382 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4653383 its a tremendous long shot that an animated show can be nominated over the live action comedy series it will be facing

4653392 harrold texas ap a tiny texas school district will allow teachers and staff members to carry concealed firearms to protect against school shootings provided the gun toting employees follow certain requirements
4653393 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4653394 i do find it kind of disturbing that the south park kids are supposed to be about 10 years old and despite this kenny is something of a pervert
4653395 we could see numerous times how he was genuinely warm and caring with mr kitty
4653396 this episode and the last one have both missed the mark maybe south park is running out of ideas because both episodes were just uncomfortable with few moments where i was actually enjoying it
4653397 i think matt and trey were saying that more money and attention needs to be given to aids in order to find the cure but it seemed vague and unfocused

4653407 cavic said it would be good for me and good for swimming if he won
4653408 im at a loss for words i had no idea the race was that close i was lucky enough to get my hands on the wall first
4653409 i thought in the perfect circumstances i could do it
4653410 ive always marveled at the fact that in the last four years he has had to live with a lot more expectations and anxiety that i had to deal with
4653411 you can always regain your femininity when you have wriggled out of the damn things after the race
4653412 so its worth looking a bit flat chested if you want the speed
4653413 hmm shall i go with the suit thats better for my body and will increase my chances of winning or the one that will increase the pleasure of men staring at my tits while i compete in an event ive been training my fucking ass off for years crap let me get back to you thats a toughie

4653418 theyve already removed this from your doorknob housekeeper comes down lets them in

4653421 eu n o imaginava que a situa o estava desta forma a gente vem para a equipe mas n o est acompanhando
4653422 temos que procurar acertos para que venham jogadores o mais r pido poss vel temos posi es muito vulner veis e precisamos refor ar teriam que vir um volante um lateral esquerdo um atacante e mais um goleiro experiente
4653423 n o foi a lista de dispensas sempre que uma equipe n o vai bem se cogita de dispensar futebol assim mesmo mas acho que n o faltou empenho pelo contr rio

4653425 you might be surprised whats going to happen in the next two days
4653426 improvement maybe will come in different ways for ronaldo next season 42 goals is a target again
4653427 its not impossible for him to achieve it given the mentality of the boy and his goalscoring abilities but its a big target for him
4653428 what you will see is improvement in his authority and his decision making which improves with experience experience gives better timing all these things
4653429 he never misses a session morning or afternoon its terrific were penciling in the beginning of october for his return
4653430 its the job of the money men hes one player who could play for any club in the world hes a fantastic player but i am happy with my players in chelsea if one or two more players arrive its better for us
4653431 if we lose to portsmouth it wont be because robinho is not here
4653432 its because we dont play very well hes just one player i have players here who could win all the games
4653433 we need to put fire in anelka we need to say look you are very good
4653434 i need to work more on his head than on the field with him but hes a very good player if he wasnt he wouldnt be in the french national team
4653435 hes played many seasons and made many goals he doesnt dribble too much but he goes direct to goal hes different to florent malouda who dribbles more
4653436 i was very very happy when two days ago he came to me and said mister i renewed my contract for five years
4653437 i said i want you here 10 years because you are a very good player and maybe after five years you can come with me as an assistant its fantastic for chelsea because he is not one player he is a symbol for chelsea and i think the fans like him even more
4653438 hamburg played very well they hit the post twice and they had chances
4653439 we are making progress but we still are not able to keep up the pressure for the whole game
4653440 when you are down 2 0 its almost impossible to come back but we managed it
4653441 i am very pleased we got the draw although we could have won as well
4653442 we are prepared to do whatever it takes to win a football game in respect of a football game
4653443 are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football the beauty in the game is to win in respect of the rules
4653444 can you win the league by playing completely non football i dont believe so historically it is proven that the teams who win the league are the better technical teams
4653445 the leading clubs have a responsibility to try to make the games attractive they can never be a long term target to play a dirty game or one which is not attractive
4653446 we want to play our game because we feel it is the most efficient way to win
4653447 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other when it comes to points it becomes a bit different
4653448 the most important thing is the actions during the game
4653449 when you go to church on a sunday the priest says everyone has to be respectful and generous but when you come out of the church everyone is not generous and respectful
4653450 we will have to show on the pitch that you are capable of doing that but not only us so will every player
4653451 he can replace alex hleb in the build up of the game in the creation of the chances and also he is very versatile
4653452 i expect he will fit well into our collective game and that he expresses a good attitude is very ambitious and fights very hard for the team
4653453 you dont want to put this out on your door when you leave simply because it is an advertisement that you are not in your room and anybody walking down the hallway anybody sees this especially if theyre a burglar knows theres a good chance you are not there

4653460 we would all like to be more trusting but i think you just have to raise your awareness and not let anyone in the house

4654020 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
4654021 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid

4654035 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defence for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4654036 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of countries with nuclear weapons if they somehow enable them
4654037 becomes an actionable object those targets are destroyed in the first order
4654038 it was too hot yesterday and it was going to be even hotter today so this is just great and i like it down here
4654039 i was going hiking but then i changed my plan so i called him and he said lets go to the beach and i said fine
4654040 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday night
4654041 i knew at the beginning of the week it was going to be a low scoring week
4654042 i was close last time and i kept looking at the rankings so im trying to forget about it
4654043 i long for my mothers bread and my mothers coffee and her touch childhood memories grow up in me day after day i must be worthy of my life at the hour of my death worthy of the tears of my mother
4654044 we have meetings in washington and i think its unique because i get to sit down with president bush and listen to his ideas about giving back to the communities and how we can get people to do more like the fans in nascar do
4654045 they like to hear ideas of how drivers like me and jeff gordon get people involved in volunteer work things we do at the tracks
4654046 it just shows that you can accomplish anything if you put your mind to it
4654047 given weve lost rusling rocca reid and dick and weve elected not to play didak theres four that would generally be part of our forward line so weve had to reinvent the forward line
4654048 leon was terrific hes been terrific the last couple of weeks
4654049 hes just starting to get over his ankle injury he was what we needed today that sort of finishing off power around the ground
4654050 i was particularly pleased with chris dawes and travis travis was fantastic
4654051 the thing about chris dawes was that he was highly competitive didnt go to ground and was also another target
4654052 he actually gives travis a little bit of leeway if you like
4654053 jack anthony came in and we trained him up as a key back and hes kicked goals again hes kicked goals in every game hes played so he takes a little bit of pressure off
4654054 we threw i suppose three or four different types of combinations at him its one of the best performances ive seen up to half time
4654055 i thought after half time we were able to reign it in and he had two centre clearances in the third quarter and none in the last he either got sick of getting it or we did something reasonably well i reckon it was a combination of both
4654056 being depressed is still filled with lots of stigma and anguish
4654057 productive people can check out for a few days to weeks it gets to the point that they cant seem to do things you know they can it can impact everybody but lets recognize it and refer people who need help
4654058 i mean you can get a prescription for a good generic medication from a doctor for as little as 4 at wal mart thats not much compared with calling in sick several days a month or showing up and not producing
4654059 i headed to the foul play bar and had a couple of beers
4654060 i started to miss deadlines and i was increasingly difficult to work with
4654061 no sense of humor i couldnt make routine decisions i told my wife amy and went to a psychiatrist but refused to take any medication i got it in my head that if i quit my job as administrator my depression would subside
4654062 trying to get my life in order continuing to refuse any treatment and getting by i took a job with renal network 11 in late march or early april of 2001
4654063 it gets worse if you dont do something it was labor day weekend of 2002 that i finally lost it

4654069 we felt that it needed to be addressed in an educational and positive manner
4654070 for all of its faults the movie brought to the attention of the general public that the word retard when used in a derogatory fashion is just as offensive as any other slang word for religious or racial groups
4654071 to this point people have not seen it that way we hope this brings attention to that and the hurt it brings to individuals
4654072 its the fact that often it is used in a derogatory mean spirited sort of way
4654073 its a result of the evolution of our own language acceptable medical terms used to include words like moron imbecile and idiot mental retardation or retard those terms are now becoming less and less accepted or tolerated
4654074 we need to know how to accept and respect other people
4654075 i just wish people could understand just because someones different it doesnt make them less human

4654080 shell go through periods where shell say i cant and she wants you to do everything for her
4654081 we dont we want her to know that she can do it because deep down she knows she can
4654082 when you dont have money to buy new things youre forced to keep things longer
4654083 i came here with the thought of getting something much cheaper than i would in the stores
4654084 the economy is down youve got to go where the buying is good
4654085 the county cant give it away and they cant sell it unless its auctioned we did it to get rid of anything not used anymore

4654091 this is a numbers game to get on the ballot if i had got on the ballot i felt confident that i could represent this district very well and be a winner
4654092 i completely respect the process and i accept the outcome
4654093 if people knew the inaccuracies the rushed period that the board of elections is reviewing and the the hyper technicalities that were objected to and were the reasons why the peoples voices and votes were disenfranchised i think theyd be quite shocked
4654094 i want to make sure their needs are carried forward since i wont be on the ballot i want to make sure whoever i support is going to deliver results and thats why i look forward to talking and speaking with all 4 candidates for this seat
4654095 it is such a privilege to announce the upcoming expansions for two of our most popular games everquest and everquest ii in a venue like fan faire where we are joined by thousands of our loyal fans and it seems more than appropriate to give those fans access to both of the expansions for free
4654096 both of these expansions are rich in content and adventure and will provide our players with hours of excitement as they explore the online world of norrath

4654113 we should not create or expand alliances where the u s does not have vital interests if the europeans want to defend distant countries like georgia they can do so after all the european union has a larger population and bigger gdp than america without any of washingtons other global military commitments it is time for europe to accept responsibility for its own security

4654156 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4654157 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4654158 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4654159 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4654160 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states
4654161 and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4654162 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4654163 i think the russian behaviour over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies

4654216 saya mengambil langkah paling rasional dalam mengatasi mahalnya harga pakan ayam sekarang ini maksudnya bulan februari 2008 masih beruntung karena harga jagung sudah relatif murah bila januari kemarin pernah mencapai rp 2500 kg dan kini sudah pada level rp 1900 2000 kg setidaknya bisa menghemat biaya produksi sehingga langkah afkir ayam masih bisa ditoleransi lebih longgar begitu juga dengan pullet saya pelihara yang pertumbuhannya terhambat akan diafkir agar tidak membebani memang untuk melakukan cara saya membutuhkan waktu dan tenaga yang lebih dan saya yakin pada populasi yang sangat besar tidak akan mungkin dilakukan
4654217 perkiraan saya harga telur ayam akan merambat naik dengan cepat ketika harga tempe tahu mahal konsumen akan memilih telur karena paling luwes dibanding daging ayam sekalipun pilihan berikut baru daging ayam hal ini juga terkait erat dengan naiknya harga daging sapi pada sebulan terakhir ini itu pertimbangan saya jangka pendek sedangkan dalam jangka panjang sudah pasti banyak peternak ayam petelur yang terus mengurangi populasinya akibat berat ongkos di pakan sehingga 2 bulan kedepan pasti dan pasti menurut saya harga telur akan sangat baik
4654218 prinsip saya oleh karena kemampuan peternak dalam rantai usaha ayam potong adalah sangat terbatas maka harus dicari di bagian mana yang masih bisa kita kendalikan sebut saja kualitas dan harga doc maupun pakan adalah diluar kendali peternak begitu juga dengan harga jualnya apa peran yang bisa diambil peternak bukankah pasar alias bakul lebih dominan mengendalikannya sehingga menurut saya sebagai peternak berharap harga ayam baik adalah boleh boleh saja namun yang lebih penting adalah melakukan budidaya pemeliharaan sebaik mungkin dan sehemat mungkin

4654313 we will use the profits to construct 536 low medium and medium cost apartments on 22 864 7sq m of land in bayan mutiara itself
4654314 both projects are scheduled to start construction in july 2009 and completed in december 2010
4654315 these are expected to be completed between 2009 and 2011 although dresidence is our most prestigious project to date i want to stress that we have not and will not neglect the communitys need for affordable housing
4654316 dresidence has received overwhelming response both phases are sold out
4654317 we build homes for every stratum of society but fundamentally we are still driven by the peoples needs and that is an objective that will never change
4654318 my background is that of a private developer so the way i run things here is similar we focus on good business sense efficiency quality and excellence in every project we embark on
4654319 that is why we did not build low cost housing on the bayan mutiara coastal land no smart businessman would have done that because it would mean not maximising the plots full value
4654320 we had to come up with a development that made good economic sense and was still very beneficial to society
4654321 this is in the best interest of the people because profits obtained will be used to build more affordable and better quality homes for the community in other areas
4654322 our development plan is to build 45 low cost 31 medium cost 16 medium high cost and 8 high cost homes
4654323 however since pdcp was incorporated three years ago we have conducted a whole new re branding exercise
4654324 prior to 2005 pdcp was merely a housing division under the pdc

4654348 since i began taking dr millers tea i no longer need to take nexium and my acid reflux is totally cleared up i dropped from 240 to 185 lbs and even though i smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a day the doctor said he could not believe how clear my lungs are as if i did not smoke the tea is the best health product i have ever taken
4654349 not only did the tea make me look years younger i feel years younger too and have more energy than ever i tell everyone this is a must have product
4654350 as a member of the medical community i was quite familiar with the causes symptoms and treatments available for crohns i became much more knowledgeable in this regard as i became a victim of this so called incurable disorder there is absolutely no doubt in my mind as to the effectiveness and medical principals behind dr millers tea i have experienced personally the pain and discomfort that results from crohns and i have also done exhaustive research into the possible treatments and cures dr millers tea is the only viable solution i am aware of for treating and clearing up this dreaded disease
4654351 i began drinking dr millers tea in september 2006 and wont go a day without it now i saw the results almost immediately losing 52 pounds between september and december and this was during the prime weight gain season of the end of year holidays after having tried pills shakes and about everything else you can think of i am thrilled to have something that actually works and is so easy to stick to and easy to afford i tell everyone who will listen that dr miller can help them

4654356 i have been drinking dr millers tea for almost 5 years it has helped me lose over 50 pounds and keep it off and keep me healthier than i had been for 40 years i can now travel and enjoy my retirement where before i did not feel well enough to do so i am amazed by the results of the tea for both me and friends i have told about it one friend of mine who is 70 years old has had terrible migraines for the past 10 years which were about to drive him crazy after a couple of months drinking dr millers tea he no longer has the migraines some of the results i see with the tea just baffle me
4654357 i own and operate an assisted living facility that houses 15 residents i began drinking dr millers tea about six years ago due to my high blood pressure and blood sugar problems both of which are health issues that run in my family i now have no problems with either of those issues and i have no doubt that the tea is the reason after i had been taking the tea personally for a couple of years i began to serve it to the residents of the alf every one of them they all wont be without it now ive personally seen it correct a multitude of health issues in people from their mid 50s to over 90 years old i have a 90 year old resident who i believe the tea is the only thing that provides her any hope of a quality of life if she doesnt drink the tea she is like a sack of bricks its as if the tea erases 20 years of aging from her also my sister was having health problems and had been told that she needed to schedule surgery for intestinal problems as soon as she told me i made sure she was drinking the tea she has not had surgery and now has none of the health issues that were prompting the surgery her husband was literally dumbfounded by the results needless to say they are avid dr miller tea drinkers the tea works wonders

4654421 its going to be a fast paced non tackling scrimmage that will have us working on all phases of the game including kicking punting kickoff and field goals
4654422 we are going to go over every situation and have it as game like as possible from our pre game routine to the attention to detail that we are looking for during warm ups
4654423 im looking for progress along all three lines offense defense and special teams i expect it to be very physical which is one reason we scaled things back a little bit friday this scrimmage will be a good report card as to where we stand at this point in camp

4654425 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4654426 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4654427 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them

4654429 the way hes pitching right now i cant imagine hes nervous pitching against anybody
4654430 hes throwing the ball great and thats all you can ask for hes been consistent all year long

4654432 none of the other thoughts leaked into my mind and when it did i just had to refocus on keeping the ball down and executing pitches that really helped me this year versus my thought process last year
4654433 i kind of had a sense of what this has meant to guthrie this entire process over the last year and this year
4654434 i think he has established for himself and for our team an identity as an oriole i think thats important to him and i thought that the approach that he had going into the game tonight was going to back that up
4654435 i just talked to him earlier and said weve kind of gone full circle here and i know how important this was to you guthrie doesnt say a whole lot but he goes it feels good i think that says something to everybody that knows guthrie and what kind of person he is its got to feel good for him he was the right guy out there for us tonight
4654436 what hes doing is each time out there hes making a statement to solidify himself as a legitimate top of the rotation guy in either league
4654437 for those of us who have had the opportunity to watch him weve seen that develop out of him i think the guy stills got some upside
4654438 it seems like its quality start after quality start out there hes our guy to look to to go out there and give us a good game
4654439 he had some good games last year but to me hes a different pitcher he looks like hes got more life on his fastball and it has that bowling ball effect where it just stays down at 97 mph
4654440 hes a big league hitter and hes become a very good situational hitter
4654441 and i think the other thing that hes done the last couple of months is work the count in his favor hes not afraid to spit on pitches and hes not reluctant to hit with two strikes i think thats the sign of a guy that is real confident
4654442 though mortgage mail volume remains far lower than a year ago this is the first uptick weve seen in two years
4654443 it could be because spring is a prime buying season or it could be a sign that lenders are slowly beginning to increase direct mail still we dont expect significantly higher mail volume until the market settles and consumer confidence returns

4654482 there is no federal antitrust claim here it has been well established for nearly a century that a retailer such as amazon is free to decide unilaterally which suppliers products it will purchase stock or resell and the terms on which it will do so
4654483 antitrust laws simply do not prevent amazon com from making unilateral changes to its supply chain

4654492 as this was my third expo ive gotten better at the networking the first time you walk around in a haze because there is so much to see the second time i was a little more of an expert but still shy with introductions and speaking to people this time i made some good connections
4654493 once a month i travel from dc to nyc for meetings
4654494 this was our first year exhibiting at bea but not my first exhibiting at shows of this size in other industries all in all i believe is was a valuable show for us however heres what i felt to be the good the bad and the ugly

4654503 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4654504 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4654505 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4654507 really all your investigating into the costs of using amazon and your conclusion that it isnt cost prohibitive is annoying it sounds like your planning to just give in
4654508 im not planning to give in im simply learning everything i can now so that if the time comes for me to make a decision about amazon i can make the best one
4654509 whats to decide why would you even consider working with those amazon pirates
4654510 remember when we talked about the legal ramifications of using lauras students real names in her book
4654511 and i explained that im not giving in to legal intimidation im simply learning the rules of publishing and doing what i can to protect medusas muse and my authors
4654512 the same principle applies here if i need to work with amazon to help my authors then i will the most important thing is the books we create not my own feelings

4654515 what would it be like if my family werent so tight knit
4654516 what could i do if i really made an honest effort to better myself
4654517 you just think youve seen horses im gonna show you a horse
4654518 i know my husband is dying we have a little miniature poodle that is the joy of his life he has asked to see her do you think i can put her in a cloth bag and sneak her into the hospital i promise shell be quiet
4654519 i will never forget the look of disappointment on her face
4654520 for the rest of the day and into the night i pondered about a possible alternative plan
4654521 it was one of the most horrible moments in my nursing career
4654522 from time to time i send my patients home with a prescription that reads one dog to be taken for a walk once and hugged twice daily as part of treatment
4654523 the next morning she woke up and was able to talk to her family
4654524 he would reach out as far as he could reach to touch the dog
4654525 you could put weights on his arms and hed still do whatever you asked
4654526 it started just as a visitation program and evolved as we discovered the fact that doctors and nurses can use a dog as a tool just like they would any other kind of medical instrument
4654527 we were even unsuccessful at getting him to take his medication
4654528 he knew where he was going so its not like we tricked him
4654529 we took a different route so it wouldnt trigger some of the negative thoughts and he did it
4654530 he would reach over and pet barley a little bit and you could see he would relax some
4654531 we finally got him to the point where we could get him to agree to take the medication he voluntarily walked back to the or and was able to be induced
4654532 as soon as she saw barley all that anxiety just melted away from her face
4654533 her parents petted barley a little bit and that relaxed them too
4654534 she wasnt smiling really big like she was when barley was in there but she wasnt back to that intense state
4654535 we introduced ronnie to aav shortly after his transfer to the coronary care unit merely with the intent to boost his morale and cope with his depression
4654536 as a direct result of the first visitation we found that ronnies recovery process dramatically improved
4654537 it was extremely exciting and uplifting to our staff to see the transformation that took place after ronnies aav therapy that enabled him to become an active participant in his healthcare goal planning
4654538 he now smiled was oriented to person place and time became physically and mentally stronger at an accelerating pace and was able to engage in self care
4654539 nearly three months after his admission ronnie was discharged from our hospital a much different person from the one who was admitted to our ccu ronnie attributes his successful recovery to having the desire to set goals which was facilitated by the introduction of aav
4654540 the response to this program has far exceeded any expectation
4654541 every visit accomplishes a miracle to see a patients hands reach out to touch a loved dog or to watch a cat curl up contentedly with its owner is incredibly comforting many times even tearful
4654542 the stories related to the pet visitations at our hospital are compelling a post cva patient who was left speechless saw his dog and spoke his name a nonresponsive lady in the neuro icu woke up and asked for a comb when she saw her dog
4654543 i missed rosies visit but when i returned to work the following monday i saw the photograph that had been taken of the patient along with rosie and her husband
4654544 this patient who was so near death on friday morning was smiling from ear to ear on friday afternoon because of rosies visit
4654545 the patient died two days later what a testimony to the human and animal bond and the soothing presence offered by one of gods creatures
4654546 good hand washing techniques meticulous animal vaccination upkeep coupled with regularly scheduled veterinarian care are recommended in preventing transmissions of diseases between animals and humans
4654547 the benefits of aat and aav highly outweigh the controllable risks
4654548 this form of therapy is attributed to the decrease in mortality and morbidity rates following a serious illness animal therapy is beneficial across the health continuum and should be employed
4654549 in my limited experience with animal therapy i have seen significant positive health outcomes in my patient population many healthcare providers did not think ronnie would survive when he transferred to our unit animal therapy along with holistic nursing care benefits many lives daily and allowed ronnie to walk out of our hospital with his new heart and kidney and a love of dogs
4654550 if dogs flunk the temperament test they are not meant to be therapy dogs
4654551 this dog has a button that if you press it hell roll over and want his belly scratched and that button is basically the entire upper part of his body
4654552 these dogs are selected based on temperament not breed and that dog is a pit bull
4654553 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4654554 while we still doubt that canada will stage an instant replay of the trauma in u s markets even a mild version would be bad news
4654555 we find that house prices play an important role in household spending decisions for several countries
4654556 the link is stronger in countries like australia canada the united states and the united kingdom
4654557 the apparent overvaluation of house prices in several advanced countries is an ongoing concern since a significant downturn in prices would have adverse effects for consumer spending and the aggregate economy
4654558 as it indicates that the extent of the cooling in the canadian housing market may have accelerated in july
4654559 however since the declines were mostly in the western cities where prices were not too long ago appreciating at a double digit pace we remain confident that the extent of the slowdown nationally will remain measured
4654560 there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from the record sales and price increase levels of 2007
4654561 fundamentals remain different than those in the real estate market in the united states

4654613 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest

4654673 the omagh fatality list reads like a microcosm of troubles deaths and left no section of irish life untouched the town they attacked is roughly 60 40 catholic protestant and the dead consisted of protestants catholics a mormon and two spanish visitors they killed young old and middle aged fathers mothers sons daughters and grannies they killed republicans and unionists including a prominent local member of the ulster unionist party they killed people from the backbone of the gaelic athletic association they killed unborn twins bright students cheery shop assistants and many young people they killed three children from the irish republic who were up north on a day trip everyone they killed was a civilian the toll of death was thus both extraordinarily high and extraordinarily comprehensive
4654674 im only after getting a call from a man with a country accent saying theres a bomb in omagh main street near the courthouse a 500lb bomb its going to go off in 30 minutes
4654675 i have received a bomb call for omagh town centre approximately 200 yards from the courthouse and the code word malta pope was given
4654676 theres a bomb courthouse omagh main street 500 pounds explosion 30 minutes
4654677 am i through to omagh this is a bomb warning its going to go off in 30 minutes
4654678 part of the ongoing war against the brits we offer apologies to the civilians
4654679 nobody thought there was going to be a bomb in omagh everybody thought it was a hoax
4654680 three women in a shop ill go for a walk somewhere else
4654681 i was just back from my lunch about ten minutes and had walked straight past the car and everything and two minutes before i was hanging out the window cause a girl that i worked with was walking past the bottom she was going out home and you know we were kind of chatting to her out the window i mean if it had went off then id have been killed id say because or a lot worse
4654682 i was in the kitchen and heard a big bang everything fell on me the cupboards blew off the wall the next thing i got blasted out into the street there was smashed glass everywhere bodies children people were inside out
4654683 i met my friend and we decided to go on down to the bus depot and as we were walking down there just past mcelroys shoe shop we were right in the middle of the road then the bomb went off i was thrown to the ground so i was and obviously i couldnt run or nothing and i saw my leg and all well i just thought ill never be able to walk again you know and then you just have to wait for somebody to come so i sat there and there was a lot of screaming around but i didnt i must have been in shock cause i didnt scream or nothing i just sat and waited
4654684 first of all there was like this massive bang which ill and then you just heard you know glass and roofs falling and you know just and then there was silence for a while and then it was like just screaming and shouting and complete mayhem it was quite scary
4654685 there was smoke coming from the brow of the hill and we stopped in our tracks for what seemed like an eternity and then we just ran towards it
4654686 i ran into the front of kells what was left of it and i went in through where the window would have been and i found the wife lying face down in the rubble now the clothes was blew off her and the first thing i reached for was her arm and i tried for her pulse there was no life i knew she was dead and then i couldnt get there was no sign of shauna or tracey and i knew they were in the shop with her and i started lifting lumps of timber and everything was carnage but there was still no sign of shauna and i thought she was dead i thought she was under the rubble thought she was buried under her mother i found tracey my second daughter on her knees beside her mammy trying her pulse like a woman who went to omagh twice a year to do shopping about the only two days she went was to get the uniforms and christmas
4654687 there were limbs lying about that had been blown off people everyone was running round trying to help people there was a girl in a wheelchair screaming for help who was in a bad way there were people with cuts on their heads bleeding one young boy had half of his leg completely blown off he didnt cry or anything he was just in a complete state of shock
4654688 it was horrible so much blood and flesh and glass sticking out of people
4654689 the first thing i noticed was what i suppose was a shop dummy lying in the middle of the street so i knew then there was people injured cause i could see everybody coming running with blood and one thing or another after i passed the first shop dummy that i saw lying in the street out of one of the clothes shops the next thing i saw in the street again was what i thought was another shop dummy but unfortunately that wasnt that was either a man or a woman ive no idea what it was but it was just a body and there were neither legs or arms or anything to be seen on it it was a sight that ill not forget anyway thats for sure and that was only one there was a lot of other sights lying on that street that really yet is still hard to describe how anybody could do that to innocent people i have no idea
4654690 there were bodies strewn all over the street it was like a battlefield of burning flesh and dead bodies with a burst water main spraying everywhere i helped lift six bodies out and did all i could for some of the injured people men women and children were lying on the road dazed and bleeding people were groaning children were crying and there was an overwhelming smell of burning flesh
4654691 there was an awful lot of water because there was burst water mains there were people lying dead and the water was just gushing over the top of them the other striking thing was there was so much blood there was blood literally everywhere an awful lot of blood on the footpath and on the road a lot of the policemen were splattered from head to toe in blood and i really mean that they were putting people who were either dead badly maimed or injured into sheets or anything they could find and just sort of dragging them down to the bottom end of the town they were waiting for any available ambulance or car to put the people into
4654692 to see that body lying in the street with smoke sort of rising from it and the smell on the street
4654693 there were limbs hanging off bodies being carried on doors everything was chaotic then just as the bus was ready to leave the door opened and someone handed a severed arm in i think that was just too much for the driver i think he cried all the way to the hospital
4654694 it was like a scene from hell i wasnt able to drive fast because people were screaming in pain as we went over the ramps at the hospital i could hear the roars of pain
4654695 nothing could have prepared me for what i saw people were lying on the floor with limbs missing and there was blood all over the place people were crying for help and looking for something to kill the pain other people were crying out looking for relatives you could not really be trained for what you had seen unless you were trained in vietnam or somewhere like that
4654696 when i came to the front of the hospital it was absolutely quiet
4654697 we ran from here to the hospital and we went in and it was just room after room after room of children some were in wheelchairs bandaged others were lying on stretchers others were just simply huddled in the corner no parents god only knows what happened to them we worked our way through the crowd and at the bottom were our two children with their friend and my mother daughter was remarkably calm and lacerations the lacerations were confined really to her hairline from what we gathered she was obviously very distressed she bled quite profusely
4654698 he was crouched down against the wall with his head in his hands he told me that his wife was dead and his children were missing i covered him up with a sheet and put my arms around him but there was nothing else i could do there was also a young boy of about 11 or 12 strapped into a stretcher his hair was burnt and standing on end and he was deathly white he kept staring at me with huge frightened eyes that image will haunt me for ever
4654699 i stayed in ward five with a local lady doing what i could until she was air lifted to altnagelvin hospital in derry for further treatment
4654700 what chance have any of us got when we are told the bomb is at a courthouse when the actual target is the ordinary townspeople in a busy shopping area hundreds of yards away there can be no ifs or buts about this there are no so called legitimate targets there can be no excuse whatever for putting the lives of hundreds of people at risk such people serve no cause but that of murder and mayhem with the help of the decent people of northern ireland we will do everything in our power to ensure those responsible for this outrage are brought to justice
4654701 to be bold lads who ripped the heart out of omagh
4654702 at the end of the first week i actually was allowed access to one part of the building by the police it was under very special circumstances because the forensic had not finished their work it was quite late at night and it was into the nicholl amp shiels corner basically it was to assess the restaurant area above there were some very obvious structural cracks and that again is a memory that will always be with me as we walked through the building the rain was coming through the roof we scanned the torch it was a very very eerie feeling maybe 20 to 30 tables with lunches cups of coffee exactly the way they had been when the bomb went off and that particular building was packed at that stage and then you felt a stickiness on your feet and as i turned the torch down i realised i was walking on blood the whole way along the building so you can only imagine what it must have been like at the time for the people in there
4654703 all we want is that my youngsters and everybody elses youngsters it doesnt matter whether theyre catholic protestant hindu or whatever religion they are that they can go to school come home and their fathers and mothers are there and theyre not afraid that every time they walk down the street if someone drops a bin lid that its a bomb
4654704 i am totally horrifed by this action i condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever
4654705 it is a ghastly act a cruel act we will ruthlessly suppress those reponsible for the attack this is the most evil deed in years from our point of view we will continue to work in dealing with this particular group with the ruc and the gardai
4654706 this is an appalling act of savagery there is total determination to bring the perpetrators to justice but an equal determinatiion that they will not be allowed to destroy the process
4654707 the people who perpetrated the omagh bombing are addicted to violence and have no place in a civilised society
4654708 on behalf of every american i condemn this butchery and hope that the culprits will be brought to justice quickly i extend our deep sympathy to those affected by this tragedy i renew my pledge to stand with the people of northern ireland against the perpetrators of violence they will find no friends here
4654709 there must be decisive action to stop the terrorists who are committed to bringing death and destruction
4654710 the sort of people who would plant this device arent interested in anything other than murder i can only come to the conclusion that bloody murder was their intent
4654711 to bring such sadness and suffering to the people of omagh at this stage is a crime against humanity
4654712 it is clear that the people who carried out this terrible deed today are not only appalling murderers they are undiluted fascists
4654713 it was an indefensible action those responsible are aligning themselves with the forces opposed to a democratic settlement of the conflict here
4654714 i was shocked to hear of the appalling crime in omagh which resulted in so many deaths and injuries please pass on my heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved injured and those others who have suffered in their distress
4654715 it is the nio who spawned the process of buying off the terrorists and encouraging the gun
4654716 this atrocity would not have happened if the ira had handed over its weapons and explosives sinn fein cannot escape its responsibility in this bloody atrocity
4654717 this is the most horrific event in the history of northern ireland
4654718 i remember only too well feeling deeply angered when my great uncle lord mountbatten and other relations were blown to pieces nineteen years ago i remember so well feeling that so i can understand a little some of the feelings perhaps of those who lost their loved ones on this occasion
4654719 it is an attempt to excuse the inexcusable murder can never be excused or justified the people of northern ireland will treat the statement and its authors with the contempt they deserve
4654720 it is a pathetic attempt at an excuse for mass murder it is contemptable and it is an insult to the people of omagh
4654721 we are facing an enormous task requiring meticulous examination of literally tons of rubble this additional help represents a very significant increase in our ability to extract as quickly as humanly possible every last piece of evidence in what is a very complex jigsaw
4654722 these were the words of chief superintendent eric anderson when announcing the largest murder investigation ever in northern ireland in which specialists were called in from londons metropolitan police to assist the ruc
4654723 a number of similar bombs had been intercepted near the border in the preceding months sure enough the real ira admitted responsibility a few days after the bomb
4654724 we have a full team continually working on this investigation we have been working in close co operation with a number of other police forces we are pursuing a number of inquiries and it is likely that more arrests will follow but we still need help from the public
4654725 the fund will be used for the benefit of those who died or were injured as a result of the omagh bomb their relatives and dependants and those persons who have been adversely affected by the tragedy
4654726 what can i say i could finish out at the border with a hole in my head
4654727 the board considered in detail the findings of the review against the agreed terms of reference and following discussion by majority view agreed to adopt the report
4654728 in all of their discussions the board has been mindful of the views that have been expressed to them by those who have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of the omagh bombing atrocity in respect of terms of reference no 1 of the review the board accepts the finding of the review a view shared by the chief constable that unless further witnesses or evidence is made available there is no prospect of securing a prosecution the board would once again ask anyone in the community who may be able help provide any evidence to bring it forward to the psni
4654729 however in the absence of good scientific evidence a confession or reliable witnesses we conclude as did the chief constable that it is unlikely that a new prosecution can be launched at present
4654730 we sincerely trust the pps judgement in this case is delivered as soon as possible since the bulk of the case file has been with them for some time
4654731 others who may also have played a part and is disappointed that clarity around this matter cannot be provided as this generated significant public comment
4654732 this was a cooperative effort by the entire medical center
4654733 even though the births were premature we had prepared in advance we had delivery teams of nearly 25 people on standby the teams included physicians nurses and staff from ob anesthesiology and neonatology and they responded very well to the challenge of delivering quadruplets
4654734 we have excellent ob services and an outstanding neonatal intensive care unit in kaiser permanente bellflower this episode demonstrated the kind of high quality care we give to all our members

4654817 i want to build a career in customer service this job would allow me to apply what i know already and also develop best practice skills starting from the operating level which would help serve your customers better
4654818 that we are building muscle and getting stronger for our sport that we like to play
4654819 gives me something fun to do at night and gets me in great shape
4654820 i like you lift weights and exercise to get strong

4654828 back then werder opened the door to europe for me i had two wonderful years there
4654829 in the meantime the club has developed very well and is now one of the best teams in europe
4654830 i hope to help werder with my international experience and am delighted about my new team
4654831 the opportunity to play with werder in the champions league greatly influenced my decision money only played a minor role
4654832 we had been looking into a number of possibilities but this is one we had favoured for some time and we are delighted that the transfer of claudio pizarro has now been realised
4654833 claudio is one of the top strikers in europe and with him we can further improve on our qualities
4654834 weve known about claudios abilities for years he has constantly furthered his development and he will breathe new life into our game with his wealth of experience
4654835 ive been a manager for nearly 20 years and in some respect ive had an easy life
4654836 in the past the vultures have never circled around me and put the pressure on thats the case now then i just have to deal with it
4654837 someone has to be the favourite to be first to go i looked on when i was a 40 1 outsider and wondered what its like
4654838 last year i think martin jol was in a fairly similar position
4654839 theres always someone maybe im doing the other 19 managers a favour at the moment
4654840 whats been said hasnt shaken my self belief because ive been at west ham 18 months stayed up and finished 10th even though we had many problems
4654841 like everyone im hoping for better things from this season i understand the criticism and take it on board
4654842 i dont just close my eyes to it but i dont have to accept all of it either
4654843 it seems a bit pre meditated in some respects but i just have to get on with it
4654844 the criticism is part and parcel of the game now the build up starts on thursday and doesnt die down until tuesday
4654845 everyones clamouring for a piece and all managers understand the pressure of the job
4654846 there wont be too many complaining because we know its part and parcel of what we do thats the way it is in the premier league now
4654847 i always seem to be defending myself and the team so id like not to have to do that i want everyone to give us a fair crack
4654848 theres no manager in the country who wants to be in a challenging position then fall away as if we do it on purpose
4654849 its amazing that people keep talking like that this reference to charlton is irritating because theyre a totally different set of circumstances
4654850 charlton came from nowhere and tried to establish themselves in the premier league they did that successfully
4654851 i am hopeful however that something will happen before the deadline as there is money to spend
4654852 we have not been able to strengthen but if you look around the clubs it has been quite difficult for most of them
4654853 these things happen in football and everton are not the only ones with this problem
4654854 i want to continue the progress we have made over the last four or five years
4654855 everton have done really well and we have changed the club around in that time
4654856 we have been fortunate enough to have bits of success regarding our league position considering the position we were in five or six years ago there has been a big improvement
4654857 we have climbed away from the bottom of the league and our football has improved it is always my ambition to crack the top four
4654858 i have to make sure i can continue to make everton grow thats my job
4654859 everton are growing and we have a ground to play in it is a great stadium
4654860 so it is not too big an issue at the moment but we do need either a new stadium or a new goodison
4654861 it is going fine and and we are nudging things along
4654862 i am really pleased as so many ex players sometimes feel when they fall out of the game that management is an easy thing to do
4654863 but to be fair to paul he went away and he could not have gone much lower with the clubs he took
4654864 he is a player with experience of winning promotions from this division and played in the premier league last season
4654865 they said some rude mean things but thats not why i wanted to change
4654866 ive sat by in silence for a long time now about the way womens bodies are constantly scrutinized to set the record straight im not upset for me but for all of the girls out there that are struggling with their body image
4654867 i ask if we can help these farmers without raising the price of milk why assess such a small fee lets really help these boys out say 5 dollars per gallon
4654868 im not looking for any new job im running for re election
4654869 if i was bi lingual id say no in multiple languages the only job john kerry is running for contemplating or considering is the one he already has
4654870 we had a little party breakfast dinner and snacks to cheer one special athlete from hungary on to glory
4654871 they met on campus developed a relationship and it just went from there
4654872 i think my wife and i couldnt be more excited
4654873 from what mickey tells us hes been in other olympics this is his third time and to be so intelligent and graduate from auburn hes very special and everyone should be proud
4654874 no the dont have children right now but heres hoping

4654878 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4654879 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4654880 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4654881 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4654882 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4654883 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4654884 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4654885 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4654886 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4654887 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4654888 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4654889 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4654890 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4654891 as a manager who would you prefer a smart performer or a hard worker
4654892 or a fireman who has a smart solution extinguishes the fire in two hours and saves most of your house which one do you choose
4654893 they cant get over it and its inhuman to ask them to get over it
4654894 our responsibility to our shareholders associates members providers and government partners is to close this chapter now and move toward the future
4654895 i knew coming into the season regardless of what my performance was that this was going to be my last season
4654896 i feared that my abilities would diminish and i wanted to leave the game before that happened
4654897 i have never been secure in my role as a starter
4654898 i have always felt like i had to prove myself and having that motivation and fear of failure always spurred me on and gave me motivation to succeed
4654899 you lose just a very solid veteran leader with a tremendous amount of experience
4654900 it becomes an extension of an organization when you have a guy who understands that game as well as he does it is difficult when you lose someone like that on the field

4654918 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months

4654922 we came to kirkuk in an attempt to exceed the crisis and to outdo the fears and suspicions that kurds are trying to impose their dominance over the province because the city must be for peaceful and brotherly living among all ethnicities
4654923 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4654924 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq
4654925 they have changed the turkish name of the delibas mosque into dilbas in kurdish

4654947 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4654952 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4654956 it is obvious that mr savage finally came to realize that his bizarre and frivolous smears would not stand up in a court of law it is a pity that he does not show as much common sense while spewing invective daily against religious ethnic and even medical minorities on his hate radio program

4654962 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4655033 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4655034 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement pranchanda is here
4655035 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4655036 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4655037 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4655038 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles

4655040 we went to houstons the other evening and of course ordered the grilled artichokes as appetizer and then decided to order their burger
4655041 output would expand at a pace appreciably below its trend rate
4655042 helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority of the federal reserve
4655043 for all the visions of the end of the world that we see stocks are down but they really havent capitulated into great anxiety

4655062 if it werent for us having an awesome team we wouldnt be where we are as a team we know weve got to get the cars running better too
4655063 its uncharacteristic for jeff to be in this position for this long
4655064 the matter is quite simple the bible is very easy to understand but we christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers we pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand we are obliged to act accordingly take any word in the new testament and forget everything except pledging yourself to act accordingly my god you will say if i do that my whole life will be ruined how would i ever get on in the world herein lies the real place of christian scholarship christian scholarship is the churchs prodigious invention to defend itself against the bible to ensure that we can continue to be good christians without the bible coming too close oh priceless scholarship what would we do without you dreadful it is to fall into the hands of the living god yes it is even dreadful to be alone with the new testament
4655065 let caesar try to be god you should just love

4655069 she was the forerunner of all women drivers though she was basically a stunt pilot
4655070 and she raced nascar speed runs when bill france held those on the beach
4655071 if theyd held this thing 10 years ago thered probably been nobody there so some progress has been made in diversifying motorsports but you dont really see the progress until you get down in the lower levels with the bandoleros and legends cars you see a lot more diversity there
4655072 these kids who are racing right now in the lower levels some of them will be good enough to move up
4655073 the biggest progress were seeing in diversity is among hispanics
4655074 however i think the female and the african american breakthroughs will come much much later
4655075 janet guthrie was 30 years ago and how much has really changed not much
4655076 germ n quiroga has so much talent its incredible quiroga is one of mexicos top nascar racers winner last month at san luis potosi
4655077 but we may have to face the fact that we may never see women racing in nascar in big numbers that will probably not happen in the next 10 or 15 years there just arent that many racing at the lower levels not in the same numbers as hispanics and african americans
4655078 the mexico city race was very expensive for the track operator to do and would it be better for nascar to have its own series in mexico which it now has to see if this corona series can grow and prosper on its own without nascar having to bring its own stars in
4655079 the nationwide tour mexico city was part of that series is not at the level of the cup series if mexico city were a cup deal then wed all go and if were going to grow the tv market thats the way well have to go
4655080 but thats down the road unless the networks can convince nascar they want to expand into a more global type of racing
4655081 to take the next step well have to look at the global picture and the global picture starts in this hemisphere
4655082 the two sports that take in the most tv dollars are f1 and soccer and thats because they take in the world market
4655083 and to go global that means road courses in some places and that means learning how to race in the rain
4655084 willy was just way ahead of his time that was the problem
4655085 if hed come in and won a lot he could have been a lewis hamilton
4655086 but the lewis hamilton model worked because mclaren helped bring him along mclaren really began helping lewis hamilton out significantly when he was 12
4655087 and the deal is right now detroit is in tough shape it is really really brutal i just have to imagine that racing is pretty far from everyones minds up there they just want to get through these days of poor car sales
4655088 what the auto industry is really looking at right now is selling cars if they had a fairly sizeable fuel efficient car sales would be improving significantly
4655089 okay weve got all this stuff going on in racing but answer the marketing question detroit is trying to answer where is the car that gets 50 mpg
4655090 there is talk within the racing industry about do we really need 358 cubic inch engines why cant we run 250 cubic inch engines
4655091 so the auto racing industry isnt really in sync with what detroit is thinking right now
4655092 the consumers are demanding better economy and that means changing the car as we see it significantly
4655093 and where does the diversity thing fit into all this i dont think it does
4655094 yes they have to sell to hispanics and hispanics want good fuel mileage as much as anglos do
4655095 but were in a bit of a quandary about where to go i dont think auto racing has any conception about what to do about going green
4655096 you talk about green and they get this bewildered look on their face
4655097 what we need to be focusing on right now is getting in sync with what detroit wants to do once detroit figures out what it wants to do
4655098 look back at where nascar came from back in the 1960s and 1970s with those 4 000 pound 427 c i behemoths were still in that same mold
4655099 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defense for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4655100 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of countries with nuclear weapons if they somehow enable them
4655101 to be honest with you im shocked that we havent won here
4655102 weve had very good cars and have been in contention a couple of different times it always seems like theres a crazy strategy at the end that keeps us from winning
4655103 the best car wins here but in other cases its something strategy wise that plays out and it just hasnt worked for us here
4655104 kyle is doing a great job and he is certainly going to be a threat for the championship
4655105 i still put jeff gordon tony stewart and guys like that ahead of him because of the mental toughness that you develop while fighting for a championship
4655106 it doesnt mean that he cant everybody has to win their first at some point and i went through it in 06 i think if you look at what hes done behind the wheel once he figured out how to win races he hasnt stopped and once he figures out how to win championships hes going to be hard to beat each and every year and this might be his year we just dont know
4655107 we worked real close on driving styles and techniques and what we were doing inside the car and really understood each others approach to the corner at a given track
4655108 hes a smart kid he pays attention and learns from his experiences and hes not afraid to stand on the gas pedal
4655109 the past month or so ive been testing a lot and going out of town a lot were working on a new contract pretty hard and well see what we can come up with pretty soon

4655112 president obama is finally coming to europe all right the americans havent elected him yet but thats a mere technicality as far as were concerned
4655113 we made up our minds long ago our president is barack obama
4655114 in the state of the union address last night the president called out iran no less than seven times
4655115 was this speech the first step in an effort to blame all that has gone wrong in the middle east on iran
4655116 today i am introducing a resolution that clearly states that it is congress not the president that is vested with the ultimate decision on whether to take this country to war against another country
4655117 if there exists a reckless determination for a new war in the middle east i fear that the attorneys of the executive branch are already seeking ways to tie this war to the use of force resolution for iraq or the resolution passed in response to 9 11
4655118 but the american people need only be reminded about the untruths of iraq s supposed ties to the 9 11 attacks so see how far the truth can be stretched in order to achieve the desired outcome
4655119 if the executive branch were to try to prod stretch or rewrite the 9 11 or the iraq use of force resolutions in an outrageous attempt to apply them to an attack on iran syria or anywhere else this resolution is clear the constitution says that congress not the president must make the decision for war or peace
4655120 the power to declare war resides in congress and it is we
4655121 56 children from 56 chinese ethnic groups cluster around the chinese national flag representing the 56 ethnic groups
4655122 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
4655123 the rising numbers indicate that sectarian violence is spiraling out of control and reinforce an assertion that many senior iraqi officials and american military analysts have been making in recent months that the country is already embroiled in a civil war with the u s led forces caught between sunni arab guerrillas and shiite militias the numbers also provide the first definitive evidence that the baghdad security plan started by prime minister nuri kamal al maliki on june 14 has done virtually nothing to quell the violence the plan much touted by top iraqi and u s officials at the time relied on setting up more iraqi run checkpoints to stymie insurgent movement those officials have since acknowledged that the plan has fallen far short of its aims forcing the u s military to add soldiers to the capital and back away from proposals for a troop draw down by the end of the year

4655134 this software also will help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4655135 its real strength is in providing a rich framework that developers can easily build upon optimize collaborate around and then deploy on billions of devices

4655137 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4655138 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4655139 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4655140 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk

4655200 because of what happened in liechtenstein we will see a higher flow of funds into singapore the momentum is accelerating
4655201 in 2003 hong kong and singapore experienced a massive influx of capital apparently from european sources as the adoption of the savings tax directive began to seem a realistic possibility

4655203 my recommendation is to come clean tax havens are pretty vulnerable to attack
4655204 growth momentum had shown few signs of easing so the quarter on quarter contraction came as a complete shock
4655205 the external environment facing hong kong will become increasingly challenging the macroeconomic adjustment measures in the mainland china economy also need to be watched closely
4655206 the stock market correction rising inflation and dimmer global economic prospects probably dented consumer sentiments
4655207 if the economic development of mainland china slows down hong kongs economy will also be hurt
4655208 global food prices and international oil prices while showing some signs of stabilisation lately remain elevated
4655209 well respect the aspirations of the nepali people for peace
4655210 and well work for the preparation of the new constitution and the forward looking transformation of society

4655213 things are so bad in terms of law and order disruption of the highways shortages of fuel and food and people think its because of no government even people who hate the maoists will say they won the election let them have a chance

4655254 the main difference from other venues is this one will be designed by players for the players
4655255 i would want to perform at a place like this musicians would know whats waiting for them at a gig now were playing little bits everywhere this would mean intimate crowds
4655256 he thought it was great to have a place where the musicians were in charge
4655257 a completely brand new idea from a musicians point of view not only could the audience enjoy the show but it could also get away from the music to private areas that would be homey and welcoming
4655258 what better city to develop this concept than the place from where guitar maker leo fender started to influence every genre
4655259 all musicians receive vibes from the audience and in turn the audience wants to see the musicians faces
4655260 they want to feel intimately close secondly louder doesnt mean better in a venue
4655261 the city needs to move on this and look for an ideal location this fits into our cultural tourism idea
4655262 the biggest comparison would be anaheims grove and house of blues but with the history of leo fender i dont want us to miss this opportunity
4655263 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4655264 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4655265 catholics in england hate me theyve sent me excrement in the mail
4655266 night after night in bookstores i saw in peoples faces that they are interested in islam you might feel in despair as you are now a minority living in the west but people are very interested in learning more about you
4655267 it is challenging for muslims in the u s who for the first time are not living in a muslim governed state a basic message of the koran is to create a united community and share the wealth
4655268 the challenge for muslims in the u s is to come to terms with the success of the secular west
4655269 muslims need to reach out to other faiths they arent as practiced as the jews at it whove lived in sometimes hostile countries for 2 000 years
4655270 the catholics did late in the last century they came from ireland poland and europe in huge numbers and they were hated their arrival encouraged the rise of protestant fundamentalism in the u s now it is the muslims who want to be good americans
4655271 people too daunted by thick books will get a sense of things in this one
4655272 i got back a sense of what faith is all about
4655273 i didnt know how to live apart from that regimented way of life
4655274 after six years at the school i was asked to leave but nicely
4655275 my early life is a complete catastrophe it all worked out for the best
4655276 how do you take control when you dont have authority over the funds or maintain clear authority to make decisions that stymies processes
4655277 we dont get clear approvals and dont feel empowered to make decisions that might have budgetary impacts those decisions can get made but rarely
4655278 im struck with how little power and capability to influence the cisos have
4655279 most are left to cajole those who own the it funds to do what needs to be done from a security standpoint few if any have direct responsibility
4655280 the challenge is for us to improve you would think with young players like anderson ronaldo rooney and nani we have the capacity to do that there is no doubt this team will win championships long after i have left there is a good foundation here now
4655281 i am friends with carlos and we will talk before the game hes very good and our defenders will have to pay a lot of attention because he can score a goal at any moment there are many good players in the united team but carlos is playing very well and had a great season last time
4655282 there are a lot of little things but nothing directly pointing at him saying hes doing a terrible job
4655283 i would say easley is a good solid two term governor nothing spectacular but nothing north carolinians shouldnt be proud of
4655284 we are pleased to provide military personnel the unique benefit of extra legroom so that they can be more relaxed and comfortable throughout their travel experience
4655285 we are honored to fly these men and women across the country and around the world and we hope our updated policies will make their travels a little easier
4655286 really low prices and they should be of very good quality thats the only thing we look at we would never look at anything else we would discard anything else that doesnt fall into those boundaries
4655287 a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the indian race becomes extinct
4655288 to me it was obvious that theyd reach this point it just seems early
4655289 the first thing down the drain is a womans ability to control her body

4655293 your ambitions have not all come to fruition but that doesnt mean that you have failed in any way there is a time and place for everything so dont get distracted if that big brass ring has escaped your grasp yet again this is not the end of your options so do not beat yourself up about it instead focus your energy on attaining some other new goal while youre busy climbing that mountain forces will be working to give you another opportunity to try this one again

4655306 el lunes sostendremos una reuni n con el secretario garc a
4655307 desde mi punto de vista el hecho de que se convoque a un consejo nacional en donde se pretenda o se plante tomar decisiones de gran alcance si esto es as pues entonces es una cumbre consecuentemente su servidor asistir a a la reuni n del consejo
4655308 son incorrectos porque solamente est n basados en modelos matem ticos y presentan resultados en escenarios que no incluyen por ejemplo la actividad solar

4655312 parece haber un balance para una reforma razonable que no sea del todo o nada

4655328 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is
4655329 we watched it on the computer last year and i finally said i have to be part of that
4655330 but when we come down here we rarely see people we know yall need to come out
4655331 i have a velvet elvis but because of the rain we couldnt bring out all of our good stuff
4655332 i believe abortion and homosexuality are just fine and christians shouldnt meddle in these matters
4655333 i killed two one got away but i know where he lives

4655335 i like quirky and fun and bright colors love colors i picked out the blue in my bangle my earrings and my top and had fun with it
4655336 there is quite a length of tubing involved as well as tight clearances around the gas tank and rear end that need to be addressed with care as a result theres potential for it to take significantly longer than say a late 80s chevy truck long story short 700 you supply all parts muffler x pipe tips and oxygen sensors 850 you supply all parts less oxygen sensors gt 1000 if we need to supply mufflers and o2s of course the exhaust will be fully welded and treated in high temp paint to ensure a quality long lasting system
4655337 go talk to blah blah tell em i sent you
4655338 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4655339 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4655340 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4655341 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4655342 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4655343 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4655344 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4655345 ive been trying to prepare myself for two weeks and you cant
4655346 i have a lot of good memories and there were a lot of positives here their reaction it is what it is i cant predict it
4655347 even though you say you dont care what people think thats not true
4655348 you expect the best but im preparing myself for the worst
4655349 he pitched great here there should be no negative reaction ive never even thought about it but why would anyone want to have a negative reaction against eric gagne
4655350 thats in the past its been settled i dont know what else to say
4655351 you cant just sit on the couch and wait i understand that and i really respect that it is what it is i cant change the past im not going to comment on that and i think its a waste of time and you guys are stuck in the past whats happening right now is were playing good baseball
4655352 ive learned to focus on the team thats for sure
4655353 there have been a lot of positives and a lot of negatives personally but if you look at the team were exactly where we want to be were playing really good baseball and im trying to help us get to where we want to be which is in the playoffs and winning in the playoffs ive been there ive done it and i know how to do it
4655354 i remember when he would come into the game and they would play his come out song and everyone would get fired up at that stage he was as dominant as anyone has ever been
4655355 ive never seen anyone get a standing ovation when you fail the electricity was unbelievable fans really brought me up there were days during the streak that i went three four days in a row and i was really sore but the fans really helped me with adrenaline i cant describe it you had to be there
4655356 they breed dodgers here and thats what i was for 12 years
4655357 i was in the minor leagues with them forever thats where i learned to be a player how to be a good teammate
4655358 they kept you focused on what being a dodger is all about when you put that jersey on it means something
4655359 its the wrong clubhouse but its going to be exciting thats for sure im just going to soak it in
4655360 i told those guys at lakewood i want a share and a ring
4655361 seanez plays a big role because he can come in in the middle of the game
4655362 that allows us to keep madson and durbin organized in the back end of the bullpen we have to make sure that when we get down to the end of the season we have guys to call on to pitch for us
4655363 but from an ok to go out and run around and do everything standpoint hes not even close to that so hes done for the year which is unfortunate
4655364 they said hes made significant improvement but theres just not enough time to get him ready and hes still not able to even do physical things
4655365 its amazing that as far as theyve come they still havent come far enough to be able to pinpoint how long it takes to return
4655366 hes probably not going to do anything until spring training
4655367 obviously hell do his winter stuff and get ready but hes done for the year
4655368 sound psychiatric test results of a worker cannot guarantee ones sanity because there are simply too many aggravating factors such as work environment cultural differences language barriers and emotional stress that affect ofws physical and mental conditions
4655369 what is needed is for the government to look at the working conditions in the middle east of the household service workers and not these workers mental states
4655370 to determine their psychological and emotional preparation for overseas assignments particularly in handling cases of workers in distress
4655371 well we could all take my truck but i dont have enough bandannas or a lawn mower so i dont think yall could pull it off
4655372 the rs 505 paraphonic strings replaced the classic rs 202 and combined strings a basic polysynth section and a bass section
4655373 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
4655374 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
4655375 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
4655376 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
4655377 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
4655378 wtf why are my zts getting pwnd by scorp tanks
4655379 the actual risk to our economy now does not come from fluctuating world markets but from talking down our strengths and effectively talking ourselves into a crisis
4655380 gentleman you have come sixty days too late the depression is over
4655381 many people have left their jobs for the more profitable one of selling apples
4655382 structural flaws that give zoned land an artificial scarcity value and that continue to offer strong incentives for corruption the failure to tackle these issues seems ascribable in part at least to the failure to introduce international best practice measures with respect to the financing of the political process the failure to address cost and time overruns in infrastructural provision over the boom period represents a further weakness in irish governance
4655383 i think you have to look at the asset this is the question if you are borrowing x if you sell the asset if theres a bit of a downturn will you get x back in return thats the issue at the moment there doesnt seem to be an indication of difficulties
4655384 i mean quite frankly if you had taken the advice a year ago you would have lost a lot of money everybody said were going to see a huge downturn in 2005 linking into 2006 they were entirely wrong
4655385 really we should have an examination into why so many people got it so wrong my view is theres not a great problem really the bad advice of last year given by so many has maybe made some people make mistakes that they should have bought last year
4655386 on the other side of the election well get back to normality and i think that normality will be the soft landing the construction projections were that we will move from something like 93 000 houses to 80 something now thats not going to create any kind of a difficulty
4655387 sitting on the sidelines cribbing and moaning is a lost opportunity i dont know how people who engage in that dont commit suicide because frankly the only thing that motivates me is being able to actively change something
4655388 but there is no place for negativity no need for any pessimism above all there is no place for politically motivated attempts to talk down the economy and the achievements of our people across all sectors
4655389 im sick to death of people writing off the irish economy and next year could easily see the

4655392 hey i was looking for articles about my brother andrew and i came across this i noticed that you said you were trying to find the
4655393 de blob was the eye opener for us that we can make cool games and function as a good team the game definitely gave us the opportunity to start our own company
4655394 we always dreamed of designing an rts and when wii ware came out we immediately figured that this was our chance
4655395 kids come to school from homes that have all sorts of problems and this affects their learning
4655396 sometimes there are drunks at home and there is no money no food no transport and no school bus
4655397 what we need is breakfast programs and support for kids to have uniforms and for stationery
4655398 at the moment there no holiday programs here for kids and no support for young people
4655399 i always remembered this and would never send my own kids to school without a meal
4655400 if we had money difficulties i would say stay home and if the kids had problems at school i wouldnt let them go until we talked it out people who just talk to you about your problems at school dont really understand this predicament
4655401 needs indigenous health workers who can speak to the kids in their language and see exactly what the problems are they can then take this back to the parents and tell them that they need to attend congress local aboriginal health clinic or the hospital
4655402 there are cameras here but there is a conference room
4655403 youve got to be fucking kidding me you can not deprive me of this on some ridiculous moral ground youre fooling around with a concierge you barely just met for chrissakes you
4655404 every once in a while you have to look around and say what the fuck
4655405 in ny i get exactly what i want in the least useful form possible in paris i get exactly what i want in a way even better than i imagined
4655406 one of the cia agents in charge of americas infiltration into other countries
4655407 the main handler of these coups on the street side has been the albert einstein institution
4655408 peter ackerman a multimillionaire banker had sponsored regime changes in serbia ukraine and georgia through the albert einstein institute
4655409 is a u s government run operation designed to link gandhian methods of nonviolent protest to pentagon and u s state department efforts to overthrow foreign governments
4655410 a central role in a new generation of warfare one which has incorporated the heroic examples of past nonviolent resistance into a strategy of obfuscation and misdirection that does the work of empire
4655411 to foster u s friendly regime change in key spots around the world
4655412 the albert einstein institution non violence according to the cia
4655413 gene sharp failed in belarus and zimbabwe for he could not recruit and train in the proper time the necessary amount of demonstrators
4655414 as long as there is no dictation or control of the purpose of our work individual projects or of the dissemination of the gained knowledge
4655415 provoke repressive reactions by the state that would then justify crises of human right violations and lack of constitutional order
4655416 a big destabilization plan aiming to overthrow chavez government and to pave the way for an international intervention
4655417 gene sharp and his team led the leaders of the opposition group s mate during the demonstrations of august 2004
4655418 toward the formulation of what was called operation guarimba a series of often violent street blockades that resulted in several deaths
4655419 they are the ideologues of the soft coup and it seems like theyre here in venezuela they are laying out the slow fuse theyll continue laying it out with marches events trying to create an explosion
4655420 for those persons who are familiar with my life and work and that of the albert einstein institution these inaccuracies unless corrected will cast doubts on your credibility
4655421 none of the institutes critics has been able to provide evidence of a single violation of this allegedly apolitical transpartisan consultation policy
4655422 the einstein institution is committed to democracy and freedom the right of peoples to live liberation from oppression and to exploring and developing the viability of nonviolent struggle against military attacks and other types of political violence
4655423 it is not the institutions role to consult on how to defeat a nonviolent struggle movement which is resisting dictatorship genocide oppression or aggressive war consultation with both sides in a given conflict is more likely and desirable when the distribution of rights and wrongs between the two contending groups is mixed
4655424 the simple truth is that aei members present their research to organizations that ask them to finances permitting if the state department asked them to make a presentation i believe they would be happy to
4655425 the attendees included representatives of venezuelas broad based but fragmented opposition who are struggling to regroup after failing to force chavez from office in an anti government strike in december and january
4655426 what motivates me is that there are real threats out there to rolling back venezuelas exciting and ambitious socialist initiatives and we need to focus on countering them not being sidetracked by paranoid fantasies against phantom enemies
4655427 all peace activists want peace but do activists want peace at any cost
4655428 we operate on what we regard as a deeper level
4655429 strategic nonviolent struggle is all about political power how to seize political power and how to deny it to others
4655430 nonviolent strategy is no different from armed conflict except that very different weapons systems are employed
4655431 no government that had the support of the majority of its people has ever been overthrown through a nonviolent civil resistance movement
4655432 experience has shown that nonviolent struggle is an effective means of waging conflict
4655433 racist attitude that the peoples of non western societies are incapable of deciding on their own to resist illegitimate authority without some western scholar telling them to do so
4655434 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4655435 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4655436 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4655437 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4655438 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4655439 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4655440 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4655441 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4655442 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day

4655460 it gave me extra inspiration knowing that in just a few months i could have one of those of my own
4655461 she was definitely in her zone and on her game especially these last few weeks
4655462 she was just getting going at national championships and the trials you could tell what she was planning and hoping to do
4655463 and she didnt either we just had our own problems to work out
4655464 i think we cried a little bit both of us
4655465 this is our day and she came through its just unbelievable
4655466 that the republican party has scapegoated every ethnic group and therefore cant create a multicultural identity and reach younger voters
4655467 the poet unmasks the language of power the language of power is the language of the lie
4655468 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point
4655469 however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
4655470 were unable to locate any record to suggest that we got specific enough information that would have positioned us to react on the childs behalf in this case
4655471 if social services and baltimore city police department listened when i was crying for help to save that baby he would have been alive
4655472 its so important for any adult who sees a child they believe is unsafe picks up a phone and calls us and gives us as much specific information as they can in terms of address a time a date something happened

4655500 called simplifymedia the app by the company of the same name uses a companion app for mac linux or windows systems to share itunes songs and playlists from both the users own computer and any of 30 friends the user marks as friends

4655502 importantly the software isnt limited to a wi fi connection and will work albeit not as quickly over 2g and 3g cellular internet access

4655537 we have not sacked anybody as an organisation we work on a performance improvement plan which comes in cycles i dont have the exact number of people who have been asked to leave but i can tell you it is around 250 or less and that too this has happened over the past few months
4655538 in chennai alone the poor performers maybe a handful less than five
4655539 elimination due to poor performance is a natural process all this while we had allowed these people to stay on but since our ramco virtual works platform a technology platform is maturing and since productivity levels are increasing we have cut flab our annual appraisal happens between april and july and the bottom 7 of employees have been shown the door
4655540 we have asked 20 trainees to leave they were all freshers who were not upto the mark none of whom we have asked to leave are in the middle or senior management
4655541 it is still a fraction but the good news is that the industry is getting serious of cutting flab

4655552 it was the first time but i was all done in
4655553 the toughest one had to be the fourth one after they changed pitchers
4655554 but nobody was thinking about any of them it just kind of happened before we knew it it was out of nowhere
4655555 i didnt know the home run i hit made history
4655556 i feel real good to be part of that record
4655557 i didnt think about a home run i just wanted to make contact and thats what happened
4655558 an honor for me just to be a part of it
4655559 it was kind of cool to watch it happen we were rooting for toby
4655560 its more of a quirky thing you see a lot of special things like a guy hitting his 500th homer

4655564 ohio stadium where i played in college is loud but im sure pro stadiums are much louder
4655565 you just have to watch the ball or do whatever you have to do to get off on the count
4655566 it is a loud stadium that just goes to their fans my ability to focus and lock in is going to really have to shine in this game
4655567 its really hard for the tackles because if were not going on a silent count they have to look at the ball and worry about blocking the defensive end at the same time
4655568 i would tell the younger guys to stay focused and get a good jump on the count we just finished camp so they should have the rhythm of the quarterback down that should allow them to anticipate the snap count instead of being late off the ball
4655569 i just want to be part of this team a part of this season and help this team win in any way possible
4655570 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed

4655576 it is very unfortunate and i am sorry that it happened and my heartfelt condolences go out to mr muttons family
4655577 standard operating procedure required a response to this case within 20 minutes
4655578 this did not occur as it took paramedics two hours and five minutes to respond
4655579 while some crews were waiting to admit patients at cbh there were other resources available that should have been redirected
4655580 mr muttons case was urgent enough to require the attendance of one of those crews
4655581 we are human we do 60 000 cases a year and now what we have to do as these cases come up is and we dont always get it as right as we want is not to have a witch hunt

4655589 in the time between mr bracks finalising this report and it being made public today the doha round of trade talks has collapsed

4655597 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4655598 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying

4655600 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4655601 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4655602 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4655603 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4655604 the community response has been absolutely remarkable and todays success was dependent on small donations from people who live right here in mount vernon and neighboring towns

4655661 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest

4655698 hey guys this week i talk about bionic commando rearmed fable 2 pub games strongbads cool game star parodier break in and street fighter alpha i forgot to mention that rockband dlc this week is a variety of 6 songs in the roadrunner pack 1 thank you for watching
4655699 another tough week for some wwe talents who got news that they were being released i know that there are some really good human beings who will be soon looking for work and i sincerely hope that none of them stop chasing their dreams perhaps the cuts of the past two weeks indicate that several of the young talents from florida championship wrestling are on the verge of being called up
4655700 edge has been as good as any one in the wwe or elsewhere in recent weeks and quite frankly i dont recall edge ever being as compelling as he is as we speak
4655701 candice michelle had surgery on her twice broken collar bone and has been working out in tampa at florida championship wrestling raw is lucky to have the gorgeous candice who is a wisconsin tom boy at heart
4655702 if you think youre too small to make a difference youve never been in bed with a mosquito
4655703 a man doesnt learn to understand anything unless he loves it
4655704 nothing good in the world has been accomplished without passion
4655705 now apparently recognizes that her conduct was criminal in nature
4655706 the pursuit of these four suspects has had a huge impact in the horn of africa
4655707 they always say we almost found him but then they dont find him after a decade they are still after these suspects still bombing the wrong places killing cows and camels and herders and arresting the wrong people the whole community is paying the price
4655708 they want to create the impression that fazul has a huge network in kenya so they can merit more resources
4655709 we would have loved to have been with them when they knocked those doors down but they didnt inform us
4655710 they are just looking for something to do so they can say they are working
4655711 i think they have failed they are poor in their jobs so they have to try something
4655712 its only the sympathizers who are keeping him from being arrested
4655713 americans must know theyre dealing with police in a third world country
4655714 only this week several people have been arrested just for ransom because anyone who paid the police was released
4655715 when i go to the police station im told hes been moved
4655716 saya sangat senang dengan performa hari ini karena setelah beberapa lap pertama pagi ini saya sempat sedikit khawatir karena kami belum mendapatkan setting yang pas lintasan baru dan kotor membuat sangat sulit mengontrol motor
4655717 saya datang ke pit dan membuat beberapa perubahan pada motor dan di akhir sesi pagi saya merasa bagus kami telah membuat banyak perubahan sore ini dan dengan settingan baru saya merasa sangat baik ketika di motor
4655718 such reception as it had was mostly bewildered or hostile or both
4655719 a rival attraction of her own provided he was a gentleman
4655720 were suddenly aware of an intense and mutual physical attraction
4655721 a dismal affair more like a wake than a wedding
4655722 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4655723 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4655724 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4655725 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4655726 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4655727 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4655728 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4655729 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4655730 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4655731 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4655732 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4655733 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4655734 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4655735 for any citizen with time to spare and a jenny block mythical monogamy why honesty in relationships is always the best policy washington famed chef julia child shared a secret with supreme court alan au is 57
4655736 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4655737 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4655738 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4655739 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4655740 your majesty if it pleases you let me go and paint you a picture of real peace and real joy but give me a month
4655741 you will die by execution if you fail to give me what i need
4655742 your majesty the real peace and joy comes from within you are not going to have sunny day all the time but when you feel like losing your mind you still got the lord to count on only he can give you unshakeable peace and joy
4655743 you scoffing at me but here you depressed even in the midst of all your riches and popularity jesus didnt die so you can have lots of toys but so that you can have life to its fullest for all eternity
4655744 you a dirt poor man you mean to tell me youre really happy with your life got this peace and joy
4655745 your majesty i am a poor man but look behind my shack i got me a lake to fish from every day since i live so far away on your border i aint got to pay so much taxes since my land belong to no one i am never alone cuz when i finally go into town folks never too tired to entertain me when it rain or storm too hard i just sit on my porch and pray he the lord takes care of all my needs according to his riches and glory
4655746 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4655747 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4655748 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4655749 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4655750 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4655751 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4655752 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4655753 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4655754 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4655755 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4655756 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4655757 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4655758 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4655759 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4655760 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4655761 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4655762 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4655763 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4655764 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4655765 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4655766 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4655767 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4655768 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4655769 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4655770 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4655771 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4655772 have you ever wondered why young people take to music like fish to water maybe its because music is fun plan and simple it opens up their minds to dream great dreams about where they can go and what they can do when they get older
4655773 the alchemical transformation of hurt and loss into joy and wonder
4655774 this is my guitar do you know who brought this in this is mine
4655775 well well see what we can do it may take months for you to get it back if the investigations clear it
4655776 you are almost certainly going to be getting this guitar back
4655777 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4655778 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4655779 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4655780 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4655781 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4655782 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4655783 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4655784 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4655785 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4655786 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4655787 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4655788 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
4655789 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4655790 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4655791 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4655792 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4655793 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4655794 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4655795 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4655796 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4655797 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4655798 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4655799 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4655800 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4655801 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4655802 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4655803 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4655804 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4655805 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4655806 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4655807 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4655808 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4655809 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4655810 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4655811 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4655812 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4655813 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4655814 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4655815 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4655816 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4655817 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4655818 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4655819 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4655820 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4655821 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4655822 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4655823 what do you want your look to say to people
4655824 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4655825 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4655826 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4655827 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4655828 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4655829 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4655830 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4655831 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4655832 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4655833 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4655834 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4655835 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4655836 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4655837 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4655838 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4655839 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4655840 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4655841 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4655842 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4655843 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4655844 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4655845 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4655846 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4655847 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4655848 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4655849 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4655850 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4655851 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4655852 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4655853 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4655854 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4655855 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4655856 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4655857 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4655858 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4655859 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4655860 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4655861 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4655862 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4655863 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4655864 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4655865 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4655866 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4655867 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4655868 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4655869 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4655870 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4655871 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4655872 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4655873 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4655874 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4655875 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4655876 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4655877 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4655878 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4655879 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4655880 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4655881 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4655882 just so you all know we did set a record
4655883 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4655884 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4655885 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4655886 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4655887 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4655888 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4655889 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4655890 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4655891 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4655892 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4655893 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4655894 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4655895 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4655896 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4655897 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4655898 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4655899 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4655900 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4655901 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4655902 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4655903 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4655904 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4655905 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4655906 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4655907 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4655908 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4655909 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4655910 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4655911 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4655912 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4655913 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4655914 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4655915 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4655916 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4655917 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4655918 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4655919 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4655920 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4655921 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4655922 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4655923 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4655924 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4655925 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4655926 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4655927 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4655928 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4655929 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4655930 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4655931 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4655932 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4655933 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4655934 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4655935 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4655936 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4655937 if god is for us then who could be against us
4655938 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4655939 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4655940 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4655941 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4655942 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4655943 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4655944 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4655945 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4655946 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4655947 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4655948 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4655949 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4655950 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4655951 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4655952 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4655953 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4655954 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4655955 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4655956 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4655957 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4655958 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4655959 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4655960 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4655961 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4655962 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4655963 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4655964 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4655965 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4655966 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4655967 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4655968 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4655969 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4655970 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4655971 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4655972 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4655973 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4655974 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4655975 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4655976 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4655977 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4655978 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4655979 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4655980 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4655981 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4655982 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4655983 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4655984 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4655985 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4655986 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4655987 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4655988 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4655989 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4655990 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4655991 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4655992 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4655993 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4655994 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4655995 guard your heart above all else for it determines the course of your life
4655996 hes a young man that plays extremely hard and plays with a great deal of physicality
4655997 hes no holds barred in terms of his aggressiveness runs the floor well and can defend multiple positions
4655998 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4655999 now thats the problem you went full retard no one ever does that ease up on the retard throttle now
4656000 the only good black part in the movie given to crocodile dundee
4656001 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4656002 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4656003 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4656004 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4656005 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4656006 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4656007 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4656008 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4656009 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4656010 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4656011 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4656012 why does this happen to the people who should be reproducing like you
4656013 she is who she is you know it wasnt naughty it was cute
4656014 dont say a word were not even gonna talk about it
4656015 this is jo she drinks about two ounces every two hours
4656016 i cannot continue this lecture pretending that everything is ok when it is not
4656017 ill give you a clue in the sleep of your mind i know it is cruel but also tis kind to wake you in blue
4656018 in the silence youll hear songs from a mute lark return a soft whistle but not with your lips and shell fly you a feather to take on your trip
4656019 but where am i going if i go where you say ill be lost and losing all these precious days
4656020 if you go where youre going youll know when youre there youll taste the sweet music and see the soft air
4656021 youll know the right path singing deep in your heart the wrong path youll know too it tears you apart
4656022 and each day you wait waiting drinking now blackened honey is time wasted playing with monopoly money
4656023 the only days precious in this life or the next are those travelling the path all others are vexed
4656024 maricarmen hola soy marita a los tiempos qu est s haciendo espera te devuelvo la llamada

4656027 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
4656028 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
4656029 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
4656030 electronically available journals may portend an ironic change for science i show that as more journal issues came online the articles referenced tended to be more recent fewer journals and articles were cited and more of those citations were to fewer journals and articles the forced browsing of print archives may have stretched scientists and scholars to anchor findings deeply into past and present scholarship searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion but this may accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas built upon
4656031 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4656032 the fig has received confirmation from the international olympic committee that all passports are valid for all gymnasts competing in the beijing olympic games
4656033 stringent control measures are taken at the time of athlete accreditation for all official fig competitions further all athlete ages for the beijing olympic games are consistent with the fig records for all past fig competitions
4656034 theres no surer way to turn new female fans into former female fans than by complaining about how hard it is to keep on weight
4656035 there appear to be conversations with younger people and other minors through the myspace account
4656036 its not a classic forcible event but the age difference makes it a forcible situation
4656037 nature of the record perhaps even members of the beatles and or other popular british invasion bands
4656038 now drive me to the bar so i can find you a father
4656039 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4656040 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4656041 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4656042 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4656043 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4656044 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4656045 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4656046 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4656047 wait did it have a dishwasher was the bedroom closet big enough what kind of floor was in the bathroom again

4656090 just move ahead in line and well pretend like we dont even know them
4656091 well weve officially been banned from every theme park in europe japan and all of north america do you have anything to say for yourself
4656092 what how was i supposed to know that there were humans in those costumes i thought it was another plot by the slitheen
4656093 come on a slitheen in a tigger costume ill have you know little jacks been having nightmares ever since we were kicked out of tokyo disney because you just had to throw vinnegar on that poor man and started complaining when he didnt melt
4656094 do you know what little mickey said to me last night when we watched the wizard of oz
4656095 he thinks the wicked witch of the west is a slitheen in disguise youve got to stop telling the children all of those stories
4656096 but theyre great i win the evil alien plots are exposed and everyone lives happily ever after mostly there was that one time
4656097 that one time i was sucked into a parallel world
4656098 besides if that hadnt have happened i wouldnt have gone on this massive dramatic journey to try and find a way to get you back which wouldnt have caused me to pick up martha without who i couldnt have overthrown the master and reset history from the year that never was and i wouldnt have found out that jack is really the face of boe and
4656099 long story but werent you lecturing me and i was trying to change the subject
4656100 stop tryingto change the subject just stop telling the boys those stories at least wait until theyre older so they dont think theres evil aliens living in the closets
4656101 when i was their age i was looking into the raw vortex of time and space
4656102 yeah well when i was their age jack harkness was stalking me
4656103 bah watch next weeks episode of doctor who and youll find out
4656104 what dont tell me you havent been curious about what jack has been up to since we dropped him off in cardiff with martha and mickey
4656105 so you mean to say all of my adventures there are serialized and turned into a television series here
4656106 but you also saw how i agonized over losing you and the pain that i
4656107 its all on dvd mum has series 1 she really liked you with big ears even if you were a tad annoying and rough
4656108 she says its because you looked old enough to be my father i think she just likes re watching the scenes where she slaps you
4656109 it is not the case that the brigade involved was under prepared or under resourced its conduct was exemplary throughout its tour typifying the professionalism bravery and swiftness of action that defines our armed forces but that does not mean that we should not learn lessons from the tragic loss of lance corporal mathew ford
4656110 if you knew who i am you would ask me for living water
4656111 are you better than jacob who gave us this well
4656112 man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god
4656113 god must have one hell of a sense of humor to put me in that position
4656114 i knew coming into the season regardless of what my performance was that this was going to be my last season
4656115 i feared that my abilities would diminish and i wanted to leave the game before that happened
4656116 i have never been secure in my role as a starter
4656117 i have always felt like i had to prove myself and having that motivation and fear of failure always spurred me on and gave me motivation to succeed
4656118 you lose just a very solid veteran leader with a tremendous amount of experience
4656119 it becomes an extension of an organization when you have a guy who understands that game as well as he does it is difficult when you lose someone like that on the field
4656120 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong
4656121 i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4656122 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season there are three or four other clubs who have good teams like tottenham and portsmouth who are strong teams
4656123 i saw manchester city in the uefa cup and just because they lost doesnt mean they are not a good team
4656124 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games
4656125 here you can never be sure you will win a game and that is exciting every week you have a new challenge
4656126 one week you will be playing a team like portsmouth who have a lot of tall players the next a team where everyone is fast england is different
4656127 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward he played well in the friendly games but he is quiet
4656128 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4656129 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
4656130 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4656131 i had some opportunities to sell players but they wouldnt go
4656132 theyre probably in the comfort zone here and are quite happy not to be in the team but to do their little bit and plod along really
4656133 for pedro it is a move he fancied when it was put to him and we had to do it financially so we move on
4656134 the board of directors and management staff of cornerstone provide all employees with a fair wage and benefits package and according to the new york state department of labor the current average wage rate for cornerstones union employees falls above the 90th percentile when compared with the wages of employees at other regional and statewide financial institutions
4656135 as a member owned credit union we must also maintain a fiscal responsibility to our members as stewards of their assets
4656136 will ensure the continued provision of normal services to its membership
4656137 rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from god for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if god were not with him
4656138 i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again
4656139 surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born
4656140 i tell you the truth no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and the spirit 6 flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit 7 you should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again 8 the wind blows wherever it pleases you hear its sound but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit
4656141 he is a wheel kicker hell say the wheels are out of alignment hell listen to the motor and hear a knock nobody else can hear a knock but he can something is always wrong he is afraid to choose he can never make up his mind so he always finds an excuse
4656142 and do you not understand these things 11 i tell you the truth we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen but still you people do not accept our testimony 12 i have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe how then will you believe if i speak of heavenly things 13 no one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven the son of man 14 just as moses lifted up the snake in the desert so the son of man must be lifted up 15 that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life
4656143 he said he wanted to know where the locks are
4656144 he was very interested in the canal i took him on a tour
4656145 they bring back the old music music you always like
4656146 i was a little skeptical at first but now i got here its awesome
4656147 the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre v 2 then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him v 3 peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre v 4 so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulchre v 5 and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in v 6 then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie v 7 and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself v 8 then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed v 9 for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead v 10 then the disciples went away again unto their own home v 11 but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre v 12 and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain v 13 and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him v 14 and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus v 15 jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seeketh thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away v 16 jesus saith unto her mary she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master v 17 jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god v 18 mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things to her
4656148 the next day the news that jesus was on the way to jerusalem swept through the city a huge crowd of passover visitors v 13 took palm branches and went down the road to meet him they shouted praise god bless the one who comes in the name of the lord hail to the king of israel
4656149 if you are right then paul then god has broken his word gods promises have failed
4656150 do not be deceived god is not mocked for whatever a man sows this he will also reap for the one who sows to his own flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption but the one who sows to the spirit shall from the spirit reap eternal life let us not lose heart in doing good for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary
4656151 and lovingkindness is yours o lord for you recompense a man according to his work
4656152 if you dont have work for full timers then you shouldnt have work for part timers and for seasonal workers and for all that
4656153 we are saying that the county did that absolutely wrong
4656154 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4656155 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4656156 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4656157 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4656158 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4656159 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4656160 that is over we are talking about topic x right now lets not generalize and lets not throw the past into each others faces
4656161 will allow south africa based scientists to apply to work at institutions in other embo countries
4656162 short term fellowships will enable masters doctoral and post doctoral students to learn new techniques at europes top institutions
4656163 for most african scientists attending training courses in europe is out of the question because of cost time and visa administration hassles hosting these courses in south africa encourages more scientists from throughout the continent to participate
4656164 and there are many scientists from other african nations studying and working in south africa so they will benefit as well
4656165 insight into the magnitude of problems on the african continent
4656166 no trip to kiawah would be complete without a trip to rosebank
4656167 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4656168 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4656169 i get sharper and sharper with each race i do a little bit more confident about exactly what im doing at certain points in the race how to build the race properly
4656170 i dont think we were going to leave china if anyone got us dqed
4656171 its such a historic event on the line with this relay this relay might be what it all comes down to for the eight golds you dont want to be the one who screws that up
4656172 after this week with all phelps has done you dont want to be the guy standing in the way of that
4656173 people point at me but cavic is looking real good and a lot of other guys are looking really good
4656174 its going to be a tight race all across the board
4656175 for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50
4656176 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4656177 i never thought i would see this type of swimming in my life
4656178 this is absolutely going to be something for the ages a hundred years from now people will probably remember this olympics and what team usa did and especially what michael did
4656179 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4656180 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4656181 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready
4656182 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4656183 mama those arent pillows those bags are something to eat

4656208 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
4656209 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies
4656210 reported examples of the bush administration considering other deceptive schemes to justify or provoke war with iraq such as the reported consideration of painting a u s aircraft with un colors in order to provoke iraq into military confrontation
4656211 the us was thinking of flying u2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over iraq painted in un colors if saddam fired on them he would be in breach
4656212 it was also possible that a defector could be brought out who would give a public presentation about saddams wmd and there was also a small possibility that saddam would be assassinated
4656213 one of the big things our program does is leverage dollars and combine money to get the maximum benefit for our customers
4656214 most of it is because their heat bills are very high and they are still uncomfortable
4656215 everyone gets the same amount of service but it is really based on what that situation is for that home
4656216 i commend you for what youve done in the house related to insurance youve been a great leader on that
4656217 and i thank you too for what youre doing to protect floridas beautiful environment its incredibly critical for the future of florida and the country
4656218 we need to focus on the middle class we need to create jobs
4656219 they create 70 percent of the new jobs i want less regulation less taxes less frivolous lawsuits and to do everything we can to make you more successful in your business
4656220 theres a lot of good ideas for wind solar alternative energy ootc aegc but weve got to be able to drill
4656221 weve got to be able to use nuclear where we can i dont believe weve got to drill off our beaches anwr for example has 50 percent of the proven oil reserves in the country we need to go drill tomorrow
4656222 youve been there 16 years you like and know the people
4656223 you know the job its a good living why do we need to take this chance
4656224 i felt it was a very high likelihood that i could make close to the same amount of money i was making but let go of the negative parts of my job
4656225 i do think that companies put the buyouts together to try to get layoffs done in one fell swoop so they can try to go forward without leaving their organization under the cloud of ongoing pressure and job insecurity
4656226 this is probably the most important decision they will ever make
4656227 can you stay or is the writing pretty much on the wall that you really have to look to leave
4656228 do you have enough income streams coming in from your asset pool to allow you to retire
4656229 they have to either stay and continue working or take their package and go someplace else to continue working to continue to build their retirement nest egg
4656230 if you are too young you can consider taking the severance and investing it wisely for the future
4656231 how am i going to look for a job if i worked for a company for 30 years
4656232 you try to get them to recognize their strengths so they can go into something that can utilize those strengths
4656233 i was speaking to anybody and everybody who would have that cup of coffee with me
4656234 it gave me a firm footing for what my life would be so i could make a proper decision
4656235 this is going to be the year that people will start to do a lot of canning
4656236 this year because of the economy people are buying already to start canning
4656237 i think a lot more people are going to be canning
4656238 its a lot of fun a lot of satisfaction knowing that you can do something to help your family and you can tailor your cooking habits around what you have canned
4656239 they dont have time to garden and the younger people arent spending the time to learn how to garden
4656240 they figure as long as their mother or grandmother is still around they dont have to learn theyre not spending the time with them to learn how
4656241 it seems when theres an economic downturn canning becomes more popular
4656242 my mother canned and i learned from her and just continued
4656243 id rather see a pint of food go bad rather than a quarter
4656244 you want to start with fresh firm vegetables and fruits dont use older fruits and vegetables that have been sitting around because there is the danger of not having all of the microorganisms killed in the preserving process
4656245 but once you get all of the equipment thats it
4656246 theyve come out with pressure canners that are weighted and you dont have to worry about getting the pressure gauges checked every year
4656247 make sure your jars and containers and lids are absolutely clean
4656248 who knows what the cost of vegetables and fruit will be come wintertime
4656249 you better look to be canning stuff for winter now because you wont be able to afford fruits and vegetables then
4656250 canning is a very fulfilling experience because theres nothing prettier than to go down into my basement and see all of my canned goods lined up
4656251 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
4656252 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies
4656253 but now nearly seven years since 9 11 its past time to be moving on
4656254 is in a great measure the cause of all mankind
4656255 but while i beheld with pleasure the dawn of liberty rising in europe i saw with regret the lustre of it fading in america in less than two years from the time of my departure some distant symptoms painfully suggested the idea that the principles of the revolution were expiring on the soil that produced them
4656256 a faction acting in disguise was rising in america they had lost sight of first principles
4656257 they were beginning to contemplate government as a profitable monopoly and the people as hereditary property
4656258 i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about american pressure on israel we the jewish people control america and the americans know it
4656259 we are benefiting from one thing and that is the attack on the twin towers and pentagon and the american struggle in iraq
4656260 give them rope enough and they will put an end to their own insignificance there is too much common sense and independence in america to be long the dupe of any faction foreign or domestic
4656261 consistency is close to being the mark of a set of true beliefs robin waterfield on the socratic dialectic platos
4656262 the supreme curse is to do wrong and not pay the penalty for it
4656263 ninety five percent of the work of the intelligence agencies around the world is deception and disinformation
4656264 we inspire we frighten we awaken indignation anger the guerrilla is the great actor of the world
4656265 theatres a con trick do you know what that means con trick youve been deceived
4656266 disinformation we used to call it designed to misguide the enemys eye and very nice too
4656267 but thats too simple for you and misha being a bunch of over educated fanatics youve gone one further no dead meat for us oh no well use live meat arab meat dutch meat so you did and you blew it up in a nice mercedes motorcar theirs
4656268 some are dead others are taken prisoner the rest presumably are for the most part homeless or dispersed

4656290 he failed because he was too sure of himself and too used to hearing how great he was
4656291 some of the vices of the shalom regime still plague the gss
4656292 one problem is the lack of parliamentary control over the gss
4656293 the most disturbing trend is the recurring episodes in which gss agents provide misleading information to officials and the courts
4656294 the head of shabak gss has an unusual personal relationship with prime minister shamir partly perhaps because of shamirs own past in the espionage business

4656300 i failed in the pollard affair just as i failed in other intelligence operations beyond enemy lines
4656301 that is the lot of an intelligence officer who runs complex intelligence operations when you work a lot and do a lot especially in the intelligence field you win some and you lose some
4656302 nobody knows either about your successes or your failures it doesnt cause a fuss but this was a big fuss you take such a possibility into consideration but there is nothing you can do about it
4656303 but this is basically all stuff that the evidence in the case shows
4656304 does not refer to the united states as an ally which is regrettable

4656339 ive told them as soon as the season ends id be happy to talk to them
4656340 not now not once the season started my focus is on today i dont even want to look a game ahead let alone a couple of months out
4656341 if my focus wanders i yank it back this game is hard enough with dealing with that stuff and facing francisco liriano
4656342 its a great ballpark a great city and the fans have been wonderful to me why wouldnt i listen to anything they have to say im just not going to do it during the season
4656343 i had to stand between the yellow lines in the middle of the street at one point and that probably wasnt the safest thing to do
4656344 once i got across this police motorcycle pulls up and the guy writes me a ticket
4656345 i thought after all the illegal things ive done in my life and gotten away with if i had to get caught for something jaywalking wasnt that bad
4656346 packers tickets were hard to come by but that the toughest ticket for me was the preseason

4656361 its obvious if im going to be a starter i have to learn how to block
4656362 im doing a lot better i seriously have put a ton of work into it working on my steps because it does not come naturally at all
4656363 hes best in the passing game because of his quickness and soft hands
4656364 hes our best all around blocker but he can get open well run him on the inside routes

4656544 when the mongols invaded much of the muslim world during the mamluki era many people thought they were the prophesied gog and magog a vast army of a nation that is prophesied to spread much destruction and carnage chaotically
4656545 which turned out to be false because they were eventually defeated
4656546 our focus should be to use our limited time on earth to do good works and stay away from sin trying to foretell the future falls into neither
4656547 left behind a novel of the earths last days is a best selling novel by tim lahaye and jerry b jenkins which starts the left behind series
4656548 but it wasnt through running away i was going to cooperate
4656549 you can have my life story for twenty five thousand
4656550 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4656551 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4656552 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4656553 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4656554 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4656555 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4656556 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4656557 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4656558 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day
4656559 to see is not to know to hear is not to experience to do is no to learn to have a will is to do all three at once
4656560 doing things that seem illogical or non standard or doing normal things in what appear to be an illogical or non standard way
4656561 hey what else is there in life right of course its hard but thats to be expected god himself told us it would be hard
4656562 oh no i have boundaries im not going to deal with all that stuff people who do that are sick and thats not what god wants for me
4656563 those peoples problems are their own fault and i have better boundaries than that
4656564 talking with forest service firefighters i have been saying this is the sistine chapel the mount sinai the vatican
4656565 too few residents emerge from training thankful for the opportunity to practice in a fascinating and intellectually challenging field instead many believe that the world owes them something for what theyve been through
4656566 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4656567 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4656568 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4656569 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4656570 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4656571 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4656572 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4656573 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4656574 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4656575 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4656576 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4656577 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4656578 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4656579 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4656580 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4656581 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4656582 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4656583 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4656584 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4656585 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4656586 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4656587 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4656588 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4656589 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4656590 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4656591 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4656592 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4656593 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4656594 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4656595 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4656596 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4656597 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4656598 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4656599 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4656600 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4656601 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4656602 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4656603 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4656604 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4656605 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4656606 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4656607 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4656608 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4656609 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4656610 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4656611 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4656612 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4656613 who are open to doing something on the production side
4656614 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4656615 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4656616 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4656617 martin luther worshipkitchen you can see james brown lead worship on our blog www
4656618 i never knew how to worship until i knew how to love
4656619 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states and around the world
4656620 you just prepare yourself the only thing you do different is vary your work in between starts ive never had a problem with pitch counts
4656621 martin luther worshipkitchen you can see james brown lead worship on our blog www
4656622 i never knew how to worship until i knew how to love
4656623 to be honest i am looking forward to a week of actual practice
4656624 this is definitely not the way i wanted to go out but i am looking forward to getting a week on court to focus on things not in a match situation
4656625 i hit my forehand a bit better in the third set but i spent seven years not being able to hit a backhand and tonight i couldnt serve or hit a forehand
4656626 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4656627 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4656628 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4656629 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4656630 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4656631 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4656632 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4656633 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4656634 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4656635 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4656636 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4656637 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4656638 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4656639 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4656640 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4656641 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4656642 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4656643 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4656644 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4656645 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4656646 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4656647 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4656648 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4656649 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4656650 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4656651 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4656652 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4656653 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4656654 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4656655 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4656656 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4656657 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4656658 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4656659 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4656660 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4656661 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4656662 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4656663 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4656664 the customers are saying if we pay our money whats going to happen if theres a problem
4656665 there are a lot of unsavory characters involved with these travel agencies
4656666 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal

4656738 we are much more worried by georgian imperialism than russian imperialism

4656788 they were both transferred up with significant infections but to say they are symptoms of flesh eating disease thats just alarmist kind of language

4656829 the democrats have already had two forums this year on compassion why not a forum on the constitution instead or on energy dont we already know enough about the faith of mccain and obama
4656830 but by appearing at such an event obama will cool some of the opposition they wont vote for him but they might not go all out to beat him either but the event also gives him an opportunity to address one of his ongoing problems by talking about his christian faith he is telling americans no i am not a muslim

4656926 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4656927 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4656928 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4656931 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4656932 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4656933 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4656934 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4656935 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4656936 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4656937 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4656938 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

4656940 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4656941 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4656942 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4656943 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4656944 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4656945 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4656946 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4656948 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4656949 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas

4656951 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4656952 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4656953 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4656954 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales

4656962 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4656963 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4656964 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4656965 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4656966 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4656967 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4656968 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4656969 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4656970 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4656971 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4656972 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4656973 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4656974 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4656975 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4656976 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4656977 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4656978 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4656979 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4656980 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4656981 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance

4656988 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios

4656995 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4656996 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4656997 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4656998 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4656999 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4657000 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4657001 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4657002 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4657003 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4657004 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4657005 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4657006 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4657007 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4657008 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4657009 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4657010 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4657011 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4657012 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4657013 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4657014 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4657015 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4657016 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4657017 speeding a lot of it is speeding then the headlights equipment violations
4657018 to be honest im surprised there arent more injuries because of drunks because there are just so many
4657019 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4657020 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4657021 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4657022 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4657023 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4657024 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4657025 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4657026 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4657027 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4657028 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4657029 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4657030 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4657031 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4657032 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4657033 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4657034 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4657035 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4657036 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4657037 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4657038 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4657039 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4657040 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4657041 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4657042 based on the press conference held on 24th july 2008 at the government media center colombo by senior dig nimal mediwake

4657054 outside a handful of majors engineering and some of the sciences a bachelors degree tells an employer nothing except that the applicant has a certain amount of intellectual ability and perseverance even a degree in a vocational major like business administration can mean anything from a solid base of knowledge to four years of barely remembered gut courses
4657055 the solution is not better degrees but no degrees young people entering the job market should have a known trusted measure of their qualifications they can carry into job interviews that measure should express what they know not where they learned it or how long it took them they need a certification not a degree

4657101 the christ of god and jesus straightly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing
4657102 it is not befitting to the majesty of allah that he should beget a son
4657103 and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god

4657134 trailers promise you all kinds of stuff but you go see the movie and ask what did the trailer have to do with the movie the year of education the year of health care and other reforms each time hes made charged statements with tremendous plans but each one of them has petered out
4657135 while it is early days to say what the security situation is going to look like in georgia longer term the events of the past few days deal a blow to the u s s plans to support existing and new oil and gas routes that bypass russia
4657136 what happened in georgia has come on the back of other events in russia that have increased market concerns
4657137 together these are increasing the risk perception around the russian market
4657138 take all the money you want to lose to russia and you wont be disappointed
4657139 i dont think direct investors will be so easily deterred and they will still be seeking opportunities across all different sectors of the russian economy including energy
4657140 intended to reorganize the russian oil and gas industry to enhance the power of the russian state
4657141 only then after the reorganization was complete and the states capacity to protect the national interests in this strategic sector was reaffirmed would western firms be invited to participate in the russian market
4657142 russia knows they are providing huge amounts to natural gas to europe that they have a stranglehold on europe
4657143 there is no question in my mind that russia is going to play its energy card as much as it can
4657144 there are certainly very strong parallels between the development of russias domestic policy and its projection of influence over the other former soviet countries
4657145 russia has always felt it would like to exert a high degree of control over the development of the oil and gas industries of both central asia and the caucasus as well as its own
4657146 russias energy objective is to monopolize all caspian energy flows to europe so that it can then blackmail europe and force political changes to european policy
4657147 what is really at stake is the unrestricted access of caspian oil to world markets
4657148 if as a byproduct of the conflict in georgia people become more wary in the future of expanding the capacity of the export corridor through georgia then there will be no tears shed in moscow
4657149 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4657150 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4657151 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4657152 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4657153 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4657154 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4657155 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4657156 the situation is really scary now for the ruling party members
4657157 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
4657158 those who danced were thought to be quite insane by those who could not hear the music
4657159 man is born free and everywhere he is in chains

4657161 the west won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence westerners often forget this fact non westerners never do

4657166 i love my god my higher power but it is mine and mine alone and i create my connection and i decide how my connection is going to be
4657167 i believe that my connection to my higher power is separate from everybodys
4657168 i don t believe that the muslims have all the answers and all the beliefs i don t believe the christians have all the answers and beliefs or that the jews have all the answers
4657169 im always good im still here and that d rod the one is always alive
4657170 is this the program where hes going to beat up on gary coleman
4657171 celebs come in do the physical things amp kick each others ass out the ass and he loves it im always good

4657176 i dont give a sh t i loved the 92 team the 96 team i loved that but right now this is all about yao ming thats what the want they got it

4657181 ultimately i wanted to go under 8 20 just because its a barrier ive come close twice now if i had gone under 8 20 and not made the final i would have been a little bit more happy
4657182 i keep telling myself that four years from now was the olympics i was going for
4657183 in four years ill be older ill be stronger and ill be tougher thats what im going to have to look forward to
4657184 this design was born to have fun with words dont let it down
4657185 our hope is that the bible would really come off the pages that the children would be able to see that jesus was a real historical figure and what it might have been like for jesus and his disciples
4657186 i think theres a lot more dialogue these days between the adults and the children instead of being spoken at
4657187 thats what the whole thing is about the blessing to minister with the kids and the growth that happens within us as we do so
4657188 the pirates who dont do anything a veggie tales vbs
4657189 im in the tribe of issachar the donkey is their symbol
4657190 it helps you get in the feel of that era it helps me learn when i read the bible at home now i can have a picture of what it was like as soon as im old enough i want to help its a lot of fun

4657206 kini sudah tiba masanya untuk saya menunaikan tanggungjawab sebagai orang islam dan rakyat malaysia bagi menegakkan hak dan menidakkan yang batil
4657207 saya amat memahami akibat bersumpah dengan nama allah ini jika ia tidak benar dan ciptaan saya maka saya akan dilaknat dan ditimpa malapetaka serta bencana kepada diri saya keluarga serta keturunan saya selamanya oleh allah
4657208 saya bersumpah dengan nama allah di masjid wilayah persekutuan mengikut cara dituntut agama islam seperti dinasihatkan dan tunjuk ajar para ulama serta mufti saya diliwat anwar ibrahim
4657209 dengan ini saya mencabar anwar supaya bersumpah dengan cara sama untuk menafikan dakwaan saya tidak benar
4657210 saya menyembunyikan diri selama ini kerana ingin mengumpul kekuatan sebab difitnah serta ditohmah dan hari ini jumaat adalah hari terbaik untuk melafazkan sumpah

4657255 im too young for a tummy control panel in the next two years i subjected myself to a couple more swimsuit trials all walking away either defeated or with a suit i was less than thrilled with

4657263 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4657264 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4657265 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4657266 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4657267 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4657268 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4657269 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race

4657281 he and the other person had previously discussed the ku klux klan and how they thought the klan would have responded to the rally in jena
4657282 the defendant used a threatening and offensive tactic to intimidate peaceful civil rights marchers who were in louisiana to rally against racial intolerance

4657297 whoever frees a muslim slave allah will save all the parts of his body from the hell fire as he has freed the body parts of the slave
4657298 the most expensive and the most valuable to his master
4657299 whoever frees his portion of a common slave should free the slave completely by paying the rest of his price from his money if he has enough money otherwise the price of the slave is to be estimated and the slave is to be helped to work without hardship till he pays the rest of his price
4657300 once i abused a man and he complained of me to the prophet the prophet asked me did you abuse him by slighting his mother he added your slaves are your brethren upon whom allah has given you authority so if one has ones brethren under ones control one should feed them with the like of what one eats and clothe them with the like of what one wears you should not overburden them with what they cannot bear and if you do so help them in their hard job
4657301 i was in the mosque and saw the prophet p
4657302 zainab used to provide for abdullah and those orphans who were under her protection
4657303 will you ask allahs apostle whether it will be sufficient for me to spend part of the zakat on you and the orphans who are under my protection
4657304 yes it is sufficient for her and she will receive a double rewards for that one for helping relatives and the other for giving zakat
4657305 why have not its communications been made clear what a foreign tongue and an arab
4657306 o muadh do you know what allahs right upon his slaves is
4657307 to worship him allah alone and to join none in worship with him allah do you know what their right upon him is
4657308 do not exaggerate in praising me as the christians praised the son of mary for i am only a slave so call me the slave of allah and his apostle
4657309 a man fights for war booty another fights for fame and a third fights for showing off which of them fights in allahs cause
4657310 he who fights that allahs word i e islam should be superior fights in allahs cause
4657311 if we insist on calling islamic jihad a defensive movement then we must change the meaning of the word defense and mean by it defense of man against all those elements which limit his freedom these elements take the form of beliefs and concepts as well as of political systems based on economic racial or class distinction
4657312 one who kills a non muslim person under protection arabic dhimmi will not even smell the fragrance of paradise
4657313 if allah had so willed we should not have worshipped anything but him neither we nor our fathers nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than his
4657314 if it had been the will of allah the most merciful we should not have worshipped such deities
4657315 our lord not for nothing have you created all this glory to you give us salvation from the penalty of the fire
4657316 he wants to write his own tunes instead of ruining everyone elses
4657317 mark ronson needs to learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune
4657318 the monkees havent split up theyre just going under the name of the kaiser chiefs
4657319 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
4657320 anybody whose drummer writes the songs are not to be trusted
4657321 the bandstand consisted of carpeted risers facing 58th street and was cluttered with the baggage of the ellington bus there the miles davis sextet like six stragglers from a larger band took up the cause while plaza waiters took up the orders
4657322 they only asked him about matters which were of actual concern to them
4657323 dont ask about something that hasnt happened for i heard my father umar ibn al khattab curse one who asked about something which had not occurred
4657324 you ask about things we never asked about and quarrel about things we never quarrelled about you even ask about things which im not familiar with but if we did know it would not be permitted for us to remain silent concerning them
4657325 i met more of the prophets sahabah than anyone else did and i have never seen a people who lived more simply or who were less demanding on themselves
4657326 what will you do if a matter is referred to you for judgement
4657327 what if you find no solution in the book of allah
4657328 then i will judge by the sunnah of the prophet
4657329 and what if you do not find it in the sunnah of the prophet
4657330 then i will make ijtihad to formulate my own judgement
4657331 praise be to allah who has guided the messenger of his prophet to that which pleases him and his prophet
4657332 judgement is to be passed on the basis of express quranic imperatives or established sunnah practices
4657333 make sure that you understand clearly every case that is brought to you for which there is no applicable text of the quran or the sunnah yours then is a role of comparison and analogy so as to distinguish similarities in order to reach a judgement that seems nearest to justice and best in the sight of allah
4657334 as far as the prophet is concerned his opinion was always correct because allah always guided him in our case however we opine and we conjecture
4657335 when a judge makes ijtihad and reaches a correct conclusion he receives a double reward and if his conclusion is incorrect he still receives a reward
4657336 my opinion if it is correct then it is from allah and if it is wrong then it is from myself and from the kalalah is one who has neither ascendants nor descendants
4657337 until they say that there is no god but allah
4657338 zakah is a part of it by allah i would fight anyone who performed zakah if anyone were to withhold from me even the smallest amount they used to pay to the prophet i would go to war with them over it
4657339 you allow a woman to inherit from the deceased while he would not inherit from her if she were the deceased and you have left with nothing the woman from whom he would inherit were the situation reversed
4657340 how can you consider one who entered islam with misgivings to be equal to one who left his home and wealth behind and migrated to be with the prophet
4657341 they all entered islam for the sake of allah and their reward is with him this world is nothing
4657342 his sin was known only in one nation and you know what allah did to them i suggest that these people should be burnt to death
4657343 whatever path umar chose we found it easy to follow
4657344 if it were not that i am afraid to impose hardship on my ummah i would have commanded them to do such and such
4657345 if you follow your own opinion that will be right but if you follow the opinion of the khalifah before you i e abu bakr that is better because he was so good at passing judgment
4657346 0 lord guide his heart and make him speak the truth
4657347 by allah no verse of the quran was ever revealed except that i knew concerning what it was revealed and where and why it was revealed my lord has bestowed upon me a heart that is understanding and a tongue that is articulate
4657348 in regard to the sunnah of the prophet pbuh he was the most knowledgeable of all people
4657349 0 commander of the faithful if a group of people joined together in stealing would you not cut one hand off of each of them
4657350 if all the citizens of sana were to join together in murdering one man i would execute the lot of them
4657351 when i realized how grievous the matter was i lit my bonfire and called for qanbar
4657352 you were merely attempting to educate her you have done nothing wrong
4657353 these men have spoken and if this is the best opinion they can come up with then fair enough but if they have spoken only to please you then they have cheated you i hope that allah will forgive you for this sin for he knows that your intention was good but by allah you should pay compensation for the child
4657354 by allah you have spoken sincerely to me i swear that you should not sit down until you have distributed this money among your people
4657355 i asked ibrahim al nakhai did you hear from others all the
4657356 what fault is it of mine if the freedmen are improving themselves and you are not
4657357 look for whatever hadith of the prophet pbuh or sunnah or practice you can find then write these down for me for i fear that this knowledge will pass away with the passing of the scholars
4657358 the fuqaha of the period took the hadith of the prophet pbuh the decisions of the early judges and the legal scholarship of the tabiun and the third generation and then produced their own ijtihad
4657359 is any of you more knowledgeable than abd allah ibn masud
4657360 no but zayd ibn thabit and the people of madinah share the inheritance between the grandfather and the brothers
4657361 compilation of ibn abu shaybah and compare them with abu hanifahs formal opinions indeed you will find that abu hanifah departs only rarely from their way and even then his opinion will not differ from the opinions of the jurists of kufah
4657362 whenever the ulama are mentioned and their work and knowledge compared malik outshines them all no one has ever done me a greater favour than malik ibn anas
4657363 our teacher i e abu hanifah was more knowledgeable than yours your teacher should not have spoken but our teacher would have been wrong to remain silent
4657364 i ask you by allah who had more knowledge of the sunnah of the prophet malik or abu hanifah
4657365 yes and malik was more knowledgeable than abu hanifah about the quran about its abrogation and about the sunnah of the prophet whoever has more knowledge of the quran and sunnah has more right to speak
4657366 any narrator of hadith who ever carried an inkpot benefited in some way from al imam al shafii
4657367 the ahl al hadith until al imam al shafii taught them otherwise and vindicated the traditionist position through sound arguments
4657368 he malik formulates opinions on the basis of a general principle while ignoring the specific issue whereas at other times he gives a ruling on a specific issue and ignores the general principle
4657369 disagreement with malik in which he dealt with all of the matters mentioned above
4657370 you have more knowledge about hadith and narrators than i so if a hadith is authentic then tell me if it is authentic i will accept it even if it is reported by narrators from kufah basrah or damascus 50
4657371 no one before al imam al shafii wrote books on the subject of
4657372 no problem will ever beset any of the followers of allahs religion except that there be guidance in the book of allah to indicate the right way for allah the blessed and most high said
4657373 i shall explain what i have already said about the sunnah whether it particularizes the quran or provides additional legislation for matters not mentioned therein and this will illustrate what i have discussed above allah willing i shall first speak of the sunnah based on the book of allah by dealing by means of deductive reasoning with the subject of the sunnah in regard to the abrogating al mansukh passages of the quran thereafter i shall mention the fard duties specified in the quran and the sunnah in regard to them the fard duties revealed in general terms which the prophet pbuh made particular through his specifying details relating to how and when the general texts that were intended to be understood as general and the general texts that were intended to be understood as particular and finally the sunnah of the prophet pbuh for which there is no textual authority from the book of allah
4657374 we base our judgements primarily on the quran and the agreed upon sunnah concerning which there is no dispute and say this is our judgement after studying both the explicit and the implicit meanings of the texts then if we have to refer to the sunnah that is narrated by only a few persons and concerning which there is no agreement we say we accept the hadith as it is but are aware that there could be some hidden fault in its narrators then we will refer to at ijma and it is used only when necessary because it is not lawful to use al qiyas when there is a narration concerning the matter being dealt with
4657375 two issues on which he differed with al imam al shafii
4657376 instances in which al shafii opposed the iraqis in the legal interpretation of the quran
4657377 the nullification of those who permitted abrogation on laws already promulgated and proved beneficial
4657378 the two judges the qadi of ahl al sunnah abu bakr tayyib al baqillani and the abd al jabbar came and expanded upon what had been written clarified what had previously been little more than indications provided detail to what had been mentioned in a general way and removed ambiguities
4657379 which was edited and published in saudi arabia in 1400 1980
4657380 profusion of evidence or controversial issues among the jurists of the new muslim settlements
4657381 of which there is a copy at the azhar university library the books of the
4657382 the method of the the role of the followers of abu hanifah in the writing of al usul
4657383 the second type of book dealt very carefully with the meanings of words and were well arranged owing to the concern of their authors with deriving detailed solutions from the explicit meanings of narrations they were not however skillful in dealing with the finer points of al usul or questions of pure reason the result was that the writers of the second type produced opinions in some cases agreeing with those with whom we differed yet books of the first type lost currency either because they were difficult to understand or because scholars lacked the resolution to undertake such works
4657384 because the authors of books written according to this method used to introduce them with discussions of theological and philosophical issues such as
4657385 was the use of the deductive method in defining the principles of source methodology in ascertaining the validity of those principles and in refuting those whose opinions differed without paying much attention to the issues and details which stem from the application of these principles
4657386 i found that some of them claimed the differences between abu hanifah and al shafii were founded on the
4657387 and does not need to be followed by a declaration
4657388 that the addition of details to a text constitutes abrogation
4657389 that mere numbers of narrations may not be taken as a factor in according preference
4657390 and so on all of these are examples of principles inferred from the judgements of the imams indeed there are no sound narrations to suggest that abu hanifah or his two companions muhammad and abu yusuf adhered to any of these principles of source methodology as such then these principles deserve no more to be preserved and defended as al bazdawi and the others did than the opposing principles do
4657391 the attainment of the hoped for in the science of is considered to be an accurate summary of al zarkashis
4657392 i follow the book of allah and if i find no solution there i follow the sunnah of the prophet peace be on him if i find no solution in either the quran or the sunnah i follow whichever of the pronouncements of the sahabah i prefer and leave whichever i wish if there is a pronouncement on a particular matter by any of the sahabah i would not adopt any other opinion made by any other scholar but if i found a solution only in the opinions of ibrahim al shabi ibn sirin hasan al basri ata or said ibn al musayyab i would make ijtihad just as they did

4657440 were not planning a demo of the game just the creature creator
4657441 weve released a number of videos to show off the game
4657442 good games will usually sell and be popular bad games will struggle of any type or genre or style
4657443 but we still believe big high impact games will help the industry evolve and further surpass the movie industry as the next mass market story telling medium
4657444 we dont believe in focus testing ideas its like asking an audience what album they want to hear they dont know until they hear it or thinking of a target market or anything like that its an anathema to creativity we are trying to make commercially viable art not sell washing powder

4657449 most cotton growers are now pretty much dry land farmers
4657450 and by that i mean they rely on rain to grow crops like wheat and canola and chickpeas and those sort of things instead of irrigated cotton
4657451 per litre of water we produce more cotton here than anywhere else in the world
4657452 and the latest technology weve seen water use efficiency really move over the last few decades and we believe we can double the water use efficiency through you know r and d research and development in the next decade
4657453 what we need is to let the market determine what crops are grown and focus on getting water policy right
4657454 if cotton farmers think that theres no future in cotton they will sell the water and get out it
4657455 they know whats going on and they know the risks theyre taking

4657775 i have received a bomb call for omagh town centre approximately 200 yards from the courthouse and the code word malta pope was given
4657776 theres a bomb courthouse omagh main street 500 pounds explosion 30 minutes
4657777 am i through to omagh this is a bomb warning its going to go off in 30 minutes
4657778 part of the ongoing war against the brits we offer apologies to the civilians
4657779 nobody thought there was going to be a bomb in omagh everybody thought it was a hoax
4657780 three women in a shop ill go for a walk somewhere else
4657781 i was just back from my lunch about ten minutes and had walked straight past the car and everything and two minutes before i was hanging out the window cause a girl that i worked with was walking past the bottom she was going out home and you know we were kind of chatting to her out the window i mean if it had went off then id have been killed id say because or a lot worse
4657782 i was in the kitchen and heard a big bang everything fell on me the cupboards blew off the wall the next thing i got blasted out into the street there was smashed glass everywhere bodies children people were inside out
4657783 i met my friend and we decided to go on down to the bus depot and as we were walking down there just past mcelroys shoe shop we were right in the middle of the road then the bomb went off i was thrown to the ground so i was and obviously i couldnt run or nothing and i saw my leg and all well i just thought ill never be able to walk again you know and then you just have to wait for somebody to come so i sat there and there was a lot of screaming around but i didnt i must have been in shock cause i didnt scream or nothing i just sat and waited
4657784 first of all there was like this massive bang which ill and then you just heard you know glass and roofs falling and you know just and then there was silence for a while and then it was like just screaming and shouting and complete mayhem it was quite scary
4657785 there was smoke coming from the brow of the hill and we stopped in our tracks for what seemed like an eternity and then we just ran towards it
4657786 i ran into the front of kells what was left of it and i went in through where the window would have been and i found the wife lying face down in the rubble now the clothes was blew off her and the first thing i reached for was her arm and i tried for her pulse there was no life i knew she was dead and then i couldnt get there was no sign of shauna or tracey and i knew they were in the shop with her and i started lifting lumps of timber and everything was carnage but there was still no sign of shauna and i thought she was dead i thought she was under the rubble thought she was buried under her mother i found tracey my second daughter on her knees beside her mammy trying her pulse like a woman who went to omagh twice a year to do shopping about the only two days she went was to get the uniforms and christmas
4657787 there were limbs lying about that had been blown off people everyone was running round trying to help people there was a girl in a wheelchair screaming for help who was in a bad way there were people with cuts on their heads bleeding one young boy had half of his leg completely blown off he didnt cry or anything he was just in a complete state of shock
4657788 it was horrible so much blood and flesh and glass sticking out of people
4657789 the first thing i noticed was what i suppose was a shop dummy lying in the middle of the street so i knew then there was people injured cause i could see everybody coming running with blood and one thing or another after i passed the first shop dummy that i saw lying in the street out of one of the clothes shops the next thing i saw in the street again was what i thought was another shop dummy but unfortunately that wasnt that was either a man or a woman ive no idea what it was but it was just a body and there were neither legs or arms or anything to be seen on it it was a sight that ill not forget anyway thats for sure and that was only one there was a lot of other sights lying on that street that really yet is still hard to describe how anybody could do that to innocent people i have no idea
4657790 there were bodies strewn all over the street it was like a battlefield of burning flesh and dead bodies with a burst water main spraying everywhere i helped lift six bodies out and did all i could for some of the injured people men women and children were lying on the road dazed and bleeding people were groaning children were crying and there was an overwhelming smell of burning flesh
4657791 there was an awful lot of water because there was burst water mains there were people lying dead and the water was just gushing over the top of them the other striking thing was there was so much blood there was blood literally everywhere an awful lot of blood on the footpath and on the road a lot of the policemen were splattered from head to toe in blood and i really mean that they were putting people who were either dead badly maimed or injured into sheets or anything they could find and just sort of dragging them down to the bottom end of the town they were waiting for any available ambulance or car to put the people into
4657792 to see that body lying in the street with smoke sort of rising from it and the smell on the street
4657793 there were limbs hanging off bodies being carried on doors everything was chaotic then just as the bus was ready to leave the door opened and someone handed a severed arm in i think that was just too much for the driver i think he cried all the way to the hospital
4657794 it was like a scene from hell i wasnt able to drive fast because people were screaming in pain as we went over the ramps at the hospital i could hear the roars of pain
4657795 nothing could have prepared me for what i saw people were lying on the floor with limbs missing and there was blood all over the place people were crying for help and looking for something to kill the pain other people were crying out looking for relatives you could not really be trained for what you had seen unless you were trained in vietnam or somewhere like that
4657796 when i came to the front of the hospital it was absolutely quiet
4657797 we ran from here to the hospital and we went in and it was just room after room after room of children some were in wheelchairs bandaged others were lying on stretchers others were just simply huddled in the corner no parents god only knows what happened to them we worked our way through the crowd and at the bottom were our two children with their friend and my mother daughter was remarkably calm and lacerations the lacerations were confined really to her hairline from what we gathered she was obviously very distressed she bled quite profusely
4657798 he was crouched down against the wall with his head in his hands he told me that his wife was dead and his children were missing i covered him up with a sheet and put my arms around him but there was nothing else i could do there was also a young boy of about 11 or 12 strapped into a stretcher his hair was burnt and standing on end and he was deathly white he kept staring at me with huge frightened eyes that image will haunt me for ever
4657799 i stayed in ward five with a local lady doing what i could until she was air lifted to altnagelvin hospital in derry for further treatment
4657800 what chance have any of us got when we are told the bomb is at a courthouse when the actual target is the ordinary townspeople in a busy shopping area hundreds of yards away there can be no ifs or buts about this there are no so called legitimate targets there can be no excuse whatever for putting the lives of hundreds of people at risk such people serve no cause but that of murder and mayhem with the help of the decent people of northern ireland we will do everything in our power to ensure those responsible for this outrage are brought to justice
4657801 to be bold lads who ripped the heart out of omagh
4657802 at the end of the first week i actually was allowed access to one part of the building by the police it was under very special circumstances because the forensic had not finished their work it was quite late at night and it was into the nicholl amp shiels corner basically it was to assess the restaurant area above there were some very obvious structural cracks and that again is a memory that will always be with me as we walked through the building the rain was coming through the roof we scanned the torch it was a very very eerie feeling maybe 20 to 30 tables with lunches cups of coffee exactly the way they had been when the bomb went off and that particular building was packed at that stage and then you felt a stickiness on your feet and as i turned the torch down i realised i was walking on blood the whole way along the building so you can only imagine what it must have been like at the time for the people in there
4657803 all we want is that my youngsters and everybody elses youngsters it doesnt matter whether theyre catholic protestant hindu or whatever religion they are that they can go to school come home and their fathers and mothers are there and theyre not afraid that every time they walk down the street if someone drops a bin lid that its a bomb
4657804 i am totally horrifed by this action i condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever
4657805 it is a ghastly act a cruel act we will ruthlessly suppress those reponsible for the attack this is the most evil deed in years from our point of view we will continue to work in dealing with this particular group with the ruc and the gardai
4657806 this is an appalling act of savagery there is total determination to bring the perpetrators to justice but an equal determinatiion that they will not be allowed to destroy the process
4657807 the people who perpetrated the omagh bombing are addicted to violence and have no place in a civilised society
4657808 on behalf of every american i condemn this butchery and hope that the culprits will be brought to justice quickly i extend our deep sympathy to those affected by this tragedy i renew my pledge to stand with the people of northern ireland against the perpetrators of violence they will find no friends here
4657809 there must be decisive action to stop the terrorists who are committed to bringing death and destruction
4657810 the sort of people who would plant this device arent interested in anything other than murder i can only come to the conclusion that bloody murder was their intent
4657811 to bring such sadness and suffering to the people of omagh at this stage is a crime against humanity
4657812 it is clear that the people who carried out this terrible deed today are not only appalling murderers they are undiluted fascists
4657813 it was an indefensible action those responsible are aligning themselves with the forces opposed to a democratic settlement of the conflict here
4657814 i was shocked to hear of the appalling crime in omagh which resulted in so many deaths and injuries please pass on my heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved injured and those others who have suffered in their distress
4657815 it is the nio who spawned the process of buying off the terrorists and encouraging the gun
4657816 this atrocity would not have happened if the ira had handed over its weapons and explosives sinn fein cannot escape its responsibility in this bloody atrocity
4657817 this is the most horrific event in the history of northern ireland
4657818 i remember only too well feeling deeply angered when my great uncle lord mountbatten and other relations were blown to pieces nineteen years ago i remember so well feeling that so i can understand a little some of the feelings perhaps of those who lost their loved ones on this occasion
4657819 it is an attempt to excuse the inexcusable murder can never be excused or justified the people of northern ireland will treat the statement and its authors with the contempt they deserve
4657820 it is a pathetic attempt at an excuse for mass murder it is contemptable and it is an insult to the people of omagh
4657821 we are facing an enormous task requiring meticulous examination of literally tons of rubble this additional help represents a very significant increase in our ability to extract as quickly as humanly possible every last piece of evidence in what is a very complex jigsaw
4657822 these were the words of chief superintendent eric anderson when announcing the largest murder investigation ever in northern ireland in which specialists were called in from londons metropolitan police to assist the ruc
4657823 a number of similar bombs had been intercepted near the border in the preceding months sure enough the real ira admitted responsibility a few days after the bomb
4657824 we have a full team continually working on this investigation we have been working in close co operation with a number of other police forces we are pursuing a number of inquiries and it is likely that more arrests will follow but we still need help from the public
4657825 the fund will be used for the benefit of those who died or were injured as a result of the omagh bomb their relatives and dependants and those persons who have been adversely affected by the tragedy
4657826 what can i say i could finish out at the border with a hole in my head
4657827 the board considered in detail the findings of the review against the agreed terms of reference and following discussion by majority view agreed to adopt the report
4657828 in all of their discussions the board has been mindful of the views that have been expressed to them by those who have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of the omagh bombing atrocity in respect of terms of reference no 1 of the review the board accepts the finding of the review a view shared by the chief constable that unless further witnesses or evidence is made available there is no prospect of securing a prosecution the board would once again ask anyone in the community who may be able help provide any evidence to bring it forward to the psni
4657829 however in the absence of good scientific evidence a confession or reliable witnesses we conclude as did the chief constable that it is unlikely that a new prosecution can be launched at present
4657830 we sincerely trust the pps judgement in this case is delivered as soon as possible since the bulk of the case file has been with them for some time
4657831 others who may also have played a part and is disappointed that clarity around this matter cannot be provided as this generated significant public comment
4657832 some sort of information sharing between the financial institutions and the people who are handling anti terrorist activities needs to be there because it will be of no use working in water tight compartments

4657897 i think the whole of formula one is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful
4657898 we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle
4657899 its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap

4657923 im really excited about this young group of talent theyre young and theyve got a lot of things to offer weve been through this drill before a number of years ago when we were forced to play a lot of young guys early but they were much like this they were very athletic
4657924 all played at a young age back there and they grew up fast
4657925 curtis and chykie have come a long way and theyre doing really well and aaron williams is doing a good job so thats really helping our competition with deon beasley and ryan palmer
4657926 right now those five guys all of them have a chance to play we have to figure out how we play them how we substitute and what does that mean
4657927 if a guy is good enough to play then its our job to make sure that we dont disrupt our starting team and dont disrupt the chemistry of guys playing together
4657928 were really inexperienced with our safeties and weve got to find somebody fast earl is a guy who likes to play hes very passionate and hell hit you
4657929 weve just got to make sure we give them enough to be competitive with the other teams and give us a chance to win and not too much to overload young safeties really none of them have any experience
4657930 its exciting because all of us are young with the exception of ryan palmer whos playing great right now
4657931 were all young we have two or three years together so its going to be interesting not only for this year but for the upcoming years also

4657952 mccain very honored by support of pastor preaching end time confrontation with iran
4657953 john mccain gets a zero rating for his environmental record
4657954 the fact that 10 member unions have signaled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4657955 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signaling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time such a response highlights the growing development and popularity of rugby across the world
4657956 the strong response also justifies the irbs move to award two tournaments at the same time
4657957 this provides longer term certainty for the hosts rugby world cup limited and the tournaments commercial partners it also ensures that future development investment initiatives in the game worldwide can continue to be underwritten by the tournament and planned accordingly
4657958 were on the new estate but youll find us quite easy

4657960 at the roundabout take the third exit go down the hill over the bridge up the other side
4657961 what are you doing here the partys not at home
4657962 there were no attacks over the weekend but there were planes overhead
4657963 they come here and are looking for military cargo and military items
4657964 naturally our staff are rather wary when they see them
4657965 what is happening now is simply the application of new rules
4657966 our purpose is to bring absences among state employees to the same level as in the private sector there is no logical reason for public employees to be less healthy the minister has now made the reforms and he does not intend to comment on how they are applied
4657967 as an initial signal the brunetta campaign is positive and very important
4657968 it reflects a widespread desire among italians for a more efficient civil service
4657969 but the next stage the real revolution will have to be not just making civil servants work but rethinking the structure of public administration as a whole in terms of the number of employees their qualifications and their deployment where they are needed
4657970 a major problem is that many were hired through political patronage to give them a job rather than in response to the need for services
4657971 one obstacle will be that many of the state employees who will feel penalised by reforms necessary for the good of the country have strong links and patronage in local and national political circles of both the right and the left

4657978 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has the russian federation as its aim
4657979 was signed at a time of a very difficult crisis in relations between russia and the us over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4657980 the us is concerned with its own anti missile defence not polands but poland by deploying the shield will be exposed to attack
4657981 the time has come for us to base our system of mutual legal assistance and administrative assistance in tax matters on a new foundation
4657982 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive co operation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive co operation for the future
4657983 liechtenstein has shown in the past eight years that it is prepared to co operate we are ready to adopt european standards
4657984 you have to see the whole question of undeclared money not just as a liechtenstein problem but as an international one
4657985 we saw that liechtenstein was not only becoming increasingly integrated economically but also that the financial world was changing so we had to ask what response should liechtenstein make
4657986 we are in a pre election period so such a proposal is extremely controversial but im convinced its essential to implement this strategy for liechtensteins future
4657987 i can understand that some clients would like to maintain the status quo but in todays world they are well advised to review their arrangements to meet tax compliance in their home countries
4657988 we want to continue doing a good job managing the wealth of families whove given us their trust for decades with the right steps liechtenstein could become a major centre for wealth management maintaining privacy but respecting the highest international standards of transparency

4657993 the trouble with traffic is that you have 40 percent of all vehicles in this country in metro manila with a terrific concentration in the business commercial district
4657994 for about 5 5 million daily commuters in metro manila and an additional two million migrant workers from nearby provinces getting rides on scarce buses and jeepneys is a daily ordeal eight years ago it took an average of only 30 minutes for a commuter to get a ride during the rush hours according to a survey of the department of transportation and communication it now takes one hour to two hours for a commuter to get a ride
4657995 helpless thousand of commuters from all sectors were stranded for hours unable to get rides spilling into the already narrow thoroughfares jostling each other to cling to already full buses and jeepneys as if clinging to life itself

4658018 here then is the origin and rise of government namely a mode rendered necessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the world
4658019 thus necessity like a gravitating power would soon form our newly arrived emigrants into society the reciprocal blessings of which would supercede and render the obligations of law and government unnecessary while they remained perfectly just to each other but as nothing but heaven is impregnable to vice it will unavoidably happen that in proportion as they surmount the first difficulties of emigration which bound them together in a common cause they will begin to relax in their duty and attachment to each other and this remissness will point out the necessity of establishing some form of government to supply the defect of moral virtue
4658020 dude check out what hes wearing when youre old you need to dress like this

4658023 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4658024 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4658025 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4658026 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4658027 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4658028 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet

4658100 ich w rde bei solch wichtigen fragestellungen in nrw auch die partei ber regionalkonferenzen beteiligen
4658101 wir haben unsere position nicht ver ndern m ssen sie lautet nach wie vor wir suchen die auseinandersetzung nicht die zusammenarbeit
4658102 was diese partei an w nsch dir was politik hervorbringt ist weltfremd
4658103 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could

4658111 nach der j ngsten umfrage im auftrag des ministeriums unter eltern die 2007 elterngeld bezogen haben ist die zufriedenheit enorm hoch 74 prozent finden das elterngeld gut
4658112 nur acht prozent sagen das elterngeld hat uns nicht geholfen
4658113 der vorwurf ist dass das elterngeld auch eine steuerliche bedeutung hat das stimmt das gesamteinkommen entscheidet ber die steuerlast
4658114 well well just get something in walmart although i kind of dont want mcdonalds
4658115 codependents cannot heal themselves until they deal with their traumatized childhood issues
4658116 as this law of extremes begins to lose its force and as this determination wanes the political aim will reassert itself
4658117 the prime minister is reflecting a shared goal that we have
4658118 which is that as the iraqi forces become a more self reliant force well see reductions in u s forces
4658119 negotiations and discussions are ongoing every day it is important to understand that these are not talks on a hard date for withdrawal
4658120 we are looking at the necessity of terminating the foreign presence on iraqi lands and restoring full sovereignty
4658121 maybe fratto and jondroe were hoping maliki was drunk when he said those things and would apologize the next day about any confusion he may have caused and say he didnt remember what he told those ambassadors but whatever he said please ignore it
4658122 ive learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will
4658123 im going to shake you every which way but loose
4658124 take kindly the counsel of the years gracefully surrendering the things of youth
4658125 gefickt d h berf hrt f hlt sich nur ein t ter nicht aber ein unschuldiger
4658126 will make it clear that the united states seeks no permanent bases in iraq
4658127 he hasnt been held to account for the fact that all the guys he was supposedly training in 2004 are nowhere to be seen and mosul basically collapsed after he left
4658128 what emerges is a world view that is far from that of a typical liberal much closer to that of a traditional realist it is interesting to note that at least in terms of the historical schools of foreign policy seems to be the cool conservative and mccain the exuberant idealist
4658129 seeing it as a dark dangerous place where without the constant and vigorous application of american force evil will triumph
4658130 countries like iran and north korea are holdouts against the tide of history americas job is to push these progressive forces forward using soft power more than hard and to try to get the worlds major powers to solve the worlds major problems
4658131 as soon as possible as far as we are concerned
4658132 the third problem is the fact that the rules are too complex people get discouraged by the fine print on the contracts they take a look and say well im not so sure i want to sign this theres too many words laughter theres too many pitfalls so one of the things that the secretary is going to do is hes going to simplify the closing documents and all the documents that have to deal with homeownership
4658133 unlawful employment practice according to the legislation unlawful conduct occurs when 1 a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is adopted 2 an individual becomes subject to the decision or practice or 3 an individual is affected by application of the decision or practice including each time compensation is paid
4658134 its taken me this long to create a life thats diverse and interesting and balanced now hes moved on with his life and that has opened up mine as well
4658135 o my lord ifrim indeed are my bones and the hair of my head does glisten with grey but never am i unblest my lord in my prayers to you
4658136 now i fear what my relatives and colleagues will do after me but my wife is barren so give me an heir as from thyself
4658137 o zakariya we give you good news of a son his name shall be yahya on none by that name have we conferred distinction before
4658138 o my lord how shall i have a son when my wife is barren and i have grown quite decrepit from old age
4658139 i seek refuge from you to god most gracious come not near if you do fear god
4658140 no i am only a messsenger from your lord to announce to you the gift of a holy son
4658141 o sister of aaron your father was not a man of evil nor your mother a woman of unchaste
4658142 he has made me kind to my mother and not overbearing or miserable
4658143 estava em estado de choque no final foi como uma esp cie de rea o retardada n o fazia id ia de qu o apertada tinha sido a prova

4658149 the crew and the crew soccer foundation are committed to supporting the exceptional efforts of jdrf to find a cure for type 1 diabetes while also striving to assist other worthy causes within our community and fund the good work currently being done by csf
4658150 soccer aid is a terrific program that helps advance each of those imperatives while creating compelling experiences and memories the fact that so many of the jerseys are game worn makes them that much more unique and desirable
4658151 to be honest i am looking forward to a week of actual practice

4658160 i thought we had enough chances to win the game
4658161 in the three times weve played here this is the most chances weve created here if we finished them i think we win the game
4658162 we didnt finish well and making two substitutions because of injuries we couldnt make the moves we wanted tactically
4658163 last week we probably didnt deserve to be walking out with points saturday we deserved to walk off with points last week we got three this week we got none so it all evened out in the end
4658164 we were missing some players who went to the olympics like robbie rogers and frankie for having five yellows but we played well
4658165 they scored on us when we made mistakes and we couldnt finish
4658166 what we talked about with coach at halftime was to be more offensive have more personality in the front to try to look for space and look for the goal opportunities in the second half
4658167 when the game was almost over we pushed and our midfielders were more offensive but unfortunately we couldnt score a goal things just simply didnt go our way today
4658168 pat has the ability to play on the flanks right now thats where we need a little more support with rogers and ekpo gone
4658169 if his style is similar to anybody its guillermos because when he plays as one of the two strikers he finds that space underneath a little bit as a flank player hell come inside hell not do you down the wing for speed he can help with our possession game a great deal and hes had a lot of experience in this league thats why we got him here
4658170 weve come away with three points on the road in an environment that is very difficult to win
4658171 you know the surface great fan support a good team so for us to come away with three points is everything we hoped for
4658172 that break really helped us recover and focus into a 4 4 2 because we had some down time to work on it
4658173 now weve got the distractions out of our way and now i think the players are buying into things its not just the 4 4 2 its the structure guys are putting pressure on the ball trying to make tackles moving as a team and have pretty good shape now i think weve had the training to at least put things a little bit better
4658174 theyre close to the level i expected when i got here
4658175 i think were starting to get the right personnel the right pieces i think what they need to do now is continue to understand what their role and job description is and how their shape matters in the attack and while were defending
4658176 the exercise will consist of a simulated fire within the tunnel and the evacuation of participating vehicles travelling within it at that time
4658177 ti ricordi il jamaicano rimorchiato in ascensore al quale ho dato il numero della mia stanza e gli ho detto di chiamarmi per evitare di incrociare mio marito
4658178 se noi siamo il popolo organizzato lhai messo in banca
4658179 non ho un barlume di simpatia per chi parla dal punto di vista del culto organizzato le religioni non sono altro che corporation strumenti di potere politico e finanziario senza relazione con il dio che professano di servire si travestono con costumi bislacchi per dispensare precetti e causare guerre non ho allevato nessuno dei miei figli secondo le tradizioni ebraiche e non so neppure quando cadono le feste sono un antisemita no penso solo che il mondo sarebbe assai migliore senza religione
4658180 come se la ragione di tanti sprechi inefficienze ingiustizie cancrene fosse lassistenzialismo in s lo stato del benessere in s legualitarismo in s e non gli abusi le illegalit luso spregiudicato e clientelare che si fatto in italia di questi strumenti per altro mai posti alla base delle nostre scelte di politica economica
4658181 abbiamo adunque con la chiesa e coi preti noi italiani questo primo obligo di essere diventati sanza religione e cattivi ma ne abbiamo ancora uno maggiore il quale la seconda cagione della rovina nostra questo che la chiesa ha tenuto e tiene questa provincia divisa
4658182 ma per tornare agli anni settanta se non si poteva stare con il terrorismo o con la miriade di insopportabili mininomenclature della sinistra

4658184 fluoridation is the greatest case of scientific fraud of this century
4658185 the drug program was part of a much larger cia program to study possible means of controlling human behavior
4658186 lawsuits from workers and communities poisoned by industrial fluoride emissions
4658187 you can get practically any idea accepted if doctors are in favour
4658188 the august 1948 journal of the american dental association shows that evidence of adverse effects from fluoride was censored by the us atomic energy commission for reasons of
4658189 fluoride that is added to municipal water is a hazardous waste product for which there is substantial evidence of adverse health effects and contrary to public perception virtually no evidence of significant benefits
4658190 neither the us food and drug administration fda nor the national institute for dental research nidr nor the american academy of pediatric dentistry has any proof on fluorides safety or effectiveness
4658191 by using a secondary processor with its own linux based os the primary cpu is bypassed for instant access to a variety of functions think blackberry style contacts calendar email that kind of stuff opened up directly on your laptop without firing up the whole system the dedicated sub system should also preserve battery life by avoiding the power drain of larger applications

4658196 these two letters are extraordinary both on the words they conveyed and in the fact that two youngster from entirely different backgrounds made a connection an american girl who prays at church collect loose change and make bracelets for tsunami kids two oceans away an indonesian muslim girl who lost all her family and wants to kill the pain and is eager just to be a kid again just like maggie i think the world would be a better place if all of us start to have connections and conversations the way maggie and nada did

4658214 i can confirm that there were two babies transferred up from the lethbridge regional hospital but flesh eating disease is a specific diagnosis and the organism was not isolated in either baby
4658215 they were both transferred up with significant infections but to say they are symptoms of flesh eating disease thats just alarmist kind of language
4658216 our involvement from the ministry is to see what is going on and theres been nothing to suggest a breach of proper infection control measures
4658217 we havent been able to find any reason why these babies developed the infection

4658233 were playing really vanilla coverages were not putting in all our packages come back with that question after we start playing the regular season games
4658234 you just have to remember what the preseason is for we have some things we have to evaluate
4658235 you just have to do what youve got to do to be ready for sept 8 thats what really matters we want to play well in every game but at the same time you want to be smart about what youre doing
4658236 for me sometimes i was more worried about schemes making sure the guys got lined up properly knew how to adjust

4658241 we get so hung up on being anti tax that we actually become anti family when you are supporting the school you are supporting families

4658243 i found out two days ago and im still in a state of shock i still dont know what to expect i just cant even put into words how excited i am
4658244 when i donated in july i got the opportunity to write my story
4658245 i knew it would be part of the process of selecting who would go backstage to meet the senator so i took the half hour to fill it out and tell why i became a supporter of barack
4658246 following the scandals of gov bob taft and the failures of the bush administration the past four years have been a difficult time to be a republican in ohio
4658247 disheartened and frustrated with the leadership of the republican party barack obama has inspired me to believe in politics again and most importantly the power of the ordinary citizen
4658248 although i still identify as a republican and still stand for some conservative values i finally feel like america has found a leader it can look up to and trust
4658249 although ive always identified as a republican for me its more about the candidate than the party that i am affiliated with
4658250 when i see barack i see the candidate who has the best chance of bringing people together and uniting the country
4658251 we looked to find 10 individuals james story was compelling it represented the type of support sen obama has across the country
4658252 i know i am going to tell him how honored i am to be part of his campaign and how honored i am to be there and ill wish him the best of luck
4658253 i know hell have a lot on his mind before that speech
4658254 sen obama is focused on opening up the convention his acceptance speech and the democratic process to more people than ever before
4658255 supporters are responsible for building this movement and for bringing this campaign so far and barack looks forward to sharing this moment with them

4658267 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4658268 mr greenspan has been criticized for contributing to todays woes by keeping interest rates too low too long and by regulating too lightly he has been aggressively defending his record in interviews in op ed pieces and in a new chapter in his recent book included in the paperback version to be published next month mr greenspan attributes the rise in house prices to a historically unusual period in which world markets pushed interest rates down and even sophisticated investors misjudged the risks they were taking

4658304 humble yourselves in the presence of the lord and he will exalt you
4658305 the only way to get what you want is to help other people get what they want
4658306 what makes humility so desirable is the marvelous thing it does to us it creates in us a capacity for the closest possible intimacy with god
4658307 i dont have to think negative i dont like this and thats okay but i choose not to let it ruin my life i choose to think positive i can stop rumination i choose to have peace of mind
4658308 for god causes all things to work together for good to those who love him and are called according to his purpose

4658324 what worries me is that mccains eagerness for more conflict in the world pushing russia and china into a corner is not in the best interests of the united states it may be moral it may be exciting it may provide the great national purpose mccain thinks we all need to feel but it ignores the hard trade offs involved and perpetuates the whole with us or against us bluster of the last eight years we need more of that more enemies less diplomacy more conflict count me out
4658325 so placing the position on gay rights on a higher level than abortion rights can only be explained by bigotry it seems to me or in mccains case a perceived need to cater to bigotry
4658326 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could

4658328 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths

4658387 we follow the adventures of anakin skywalker and obi wan kenobi as well as other jedi fighting to preserve the lofty ideals of the republic against count dooku and his cronies who are threatening to tear the galaxy apart
4658388 even though it was animated in a stylized cg form george made it very clear to director
4658389 hes an encyclopedia of star wars knowledge combining all the hundreds of comics dozens of novels and games too there is just so much in the expanded universe everything not in the movies it was great knowing leland was there to prevent any grave inconsistencies from coming to pass
4658390 were going to see another side to him in the movie when he was a champion of the republic and a great jedi hero so hes not the brooding petulant kid we knew from the movies but the best friend and comrade in arms of obi wan kenobi as well as a playful big brother like mentor to his new padawan ahsoka tano

4658397 se definen las zonas de aptitud forestal y se determinan los suelos de prioridad forestal que ascienden a 3 600 000 hect reas
4658398 en cuanto a datos emp ricos recogidos lo m s interesante es que en las plantaciones forestales con densidades de 839 rboles ha con distintos dise os geom tricos de plantaci n puede mantenerse casi la misma carga animal que exist a antes en la misma superficie pero sin rboles estamos en camino de estudiar a fondo estas experiencias para sacar resultados validados y posibles de ser extrapolados para otros productores

4658404 why is cbc paying attention to michael phelps well hes possibly the greatest amateur athlete of all time and the biggest story of the olympics
4658405 phelps is amazing this guy is dominating his sport like no other like wayne gretzky and michael jordan in their day
4658406 michael phelps is the worlds best swimmer right now and he is on the verge of fulfilling a great achievement
4658407 we live in one of the most exciting and challenging times in history facing concerns like climate change global trade economic fairness and religious and ideological conflict

4658410 a friend of mine asked me if i was trying to write american magic realism with the book and i didnt really have an answer for him if it is it was an accident
4658411 a a surprisingly resonant pseudo update of on the road for the lo fi singer songwriter set dance to the war an urban landscape dirge with a groove is the records most song orientated offering and also the best summary of gnades rapid fire approach in it he jumps from alcohol fueled description of brooklyn and platitudes about needing to keep riding the nations highways to a news collage about irag and the middle east without skipping a beat by the last minutes of the closing title track you almost wish gnade never discovered the storys ending

4658414 they intel wont be factoring our 45 nanometer shanghai product and be making shipments of that by the end of the year
4658415 i think some of the questions that should be asked are what is their intels specific schedule for their two socket offering around nehalem and when is that going to make its way into the four socket platforms
4658416 what amd basically said today was that the company is confident about its position going into the second half of the year and despite the stumbles that they have had between last year and early this year the second half of 2008 is shaping up with their strongest product lines to date
4658417 of course amd is still up against a juggernaut in intel which also believes that the best of what they have to offer will also come to the market in the second half of 2008
4658418 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4658419 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4658420 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4658421 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4658422 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4658423 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4658424 the arrangements that the united states makes with its polish allies to make sure that poland is capable of defending itself and capable of being an active ally are frankly between poland and the united states
4658425 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4658426 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4658427 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4658428 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4658429 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4658430 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4658431 every one of russias neighbors feels less secure today than it did a week ago this is going to mean that theyre going to want help from the outside
4658432 a greater western military presence in the region is not something russia wanted but by its own actions russia has forced this to happen now and the west will respond to this
4658433 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4658434 him doesnt be conversant with that i myselfs in the lump below minus even now
4658435 him doesnt be conversant with that i myselfs in the lump below minus even now

4658439 him doesnt be conversant with that i myselfs in the lump below minus even now
4658440 its interesting how great we all get along in this little dream world
4658441 all these countries these peoples all together in this dream world why we cant get along outside of it i dont know
4658442 the ioc has taken many initiatives to bring together the two national olympic committees
4658443 there was a great willingness on the side of sport to have a joint march unfortunately the political powers did not agree i regret that very much because it is a setback for peace and harmony and reunification
4658444 we couldnt sleep all night we were up until one or two oclock in the morning all we could think about was georgia
4658445 both made it clear they are here to compete and will compete if theyre drawn against each other
4658446 theyre here in a sporting context theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect and friendship athlete to athlete so we have no reasons to have any concerns
4658447 the atmosphere is very sad we are representing georgia in our hearts at this very difficult time
4658448 its very difficult for us as georgians because of everything thats going on at home
4658449 this is a small victory for my people this medal is good for georgia especially during times like this
4658450 my brother and family are at home and theyre ok
4658451 i hope everything is restored but i have to keep my mind here
4658452 i worked so hard for so many years for this
4658453 i saw valeris gold medal every single day when i woke up that gave me a little extra motivation i think that made a little bit of difference just to be able to see it having it there in my room knowing that in a few months i could have one of my own
4658454 were just looking at each other like can you believe it tomorrows the day we just wanted to go all out and have fun
4658455 she deserved that gold medal shes one of my best friends and the usa was standing on top of the podium we just wanted the best for each other
4658456 i probably would have told you a month ago that i was done
4658457 but after being here and experiencing the olympics id give anything to feel that again if i can in 2012 ill be there

4658459 cavic said it would be good for me and good for swimming if he won
4658460 im at a loss for words i had no idea the race was that close i was lucky enough to get my hands on the wall first
4658461 i thought in the perfect circumstances i could do it
4658462 ive always marveled at the fact that in the last four years he has had to live with a lot more expectations and anxiety that i had to deal with
4658463 youre in range you are healthy go see a psychiatrist
4658464 you may have some insight into why i did that

4658467 we continue to have record months of fundraising this is now the fifth month in a row that we have exceeded the month before
4658468 which gives us plenty enough money in addition to our ongoing fundraising to prosecute a very active campaign in the month of august
4658469 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
4658470 we stand by georgia our friend and ally and call on the ioc to designate a new venue for the russian olympics
4658471 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4658472 sochi a mere 20 miles from the current conflict zone makes it a practically unacceptable location for the olympics
4658473 see all those people like myers and dawkins and so on are wrong you can believe in god and in evolution
4658474 see all those people like dembski and ham are wrong they have let their religion force them into an irrational denial of the world we live in
4658475 ive been relatively nice to folks trying to fit their god into gaps where it dissolved entirely slowly pointed this out to them
4658476 seems to me for some a confrontational atheist is just one who opens his mouth at all about it
4658477 weird the site doesnt fit well to my beliefs but i was willing to admit that some might find it copacetic and gave it a grudging recommendation and for that i get an angry excoriation
4658478 its more about finding common ground with other atheists by making yourselves known and being unafraid to admit that you are an atheist and you think the trinity to name one example is really stupid
4658479 a that wouldnt fall under what dawkins describes as child abuse hes talking about applying religious labels to small children and teaching them traumatic dogmas such as almost all of humanitys being doomed to hell not the mere act of exposing them to religion
4658480 again it seems that youre going by the accusations leveled against
4658481 no i dont know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered patriots
4658482 when they came for x i did not speak up because i was not an x
4658483 ive been relatively nice to folks trying to fit their god into gaps where it dissolved entirely slowly pointed this out to them had them admit to me and themselves as much
4658484 the evidence again i have is confrontation works being rude works being direct works not being especially diplomatic works sure maybe not always but frequently enough
4658485 telling someone theyd be an idiot to take their kids to church no i havent quite said that to anyone yet
4658486 it differentiates between aspects of behavior that are more virulent than others
4658487 which is done on a constant basis even in the legal system suggest you take a gander sometime at legislation in different states that covers the term psychological abuse
4658488 i now proclaim you dense beyond measure and intractable to boot good luck with that
4658489 you might actually want to take a look at the various related court cases over the last 3 decades and see for yourself
4658490 obviously no thats a basic religious doctrine central to mainstream christianit y and it is clearly protected speech
4658491 but would rather base your position on your own incredulity that any of that would violate your simplistic notions of
4658492 hes talking about applying religious labels to small children and teaching them traumatic dogmas such as almost all of humanitys being doomed to hell not the mere act of exposing them to religion
4658493 ok the link is added now youre required to add new content in return
4658494 a that wouldnt fall under what dawkins describes as child abuse hes talking about applying religious labels to small children and teaching them traumatic dogmas such as almost all of humanitys being doomed to hell not the mere act of exposing them to religion
4658495 again it seems that youre going by the accusations leveled against
4658496 a case could be made that children should be protected by law against verbal abuse such as hell fire scaring as well as physical abuse
4658497 a that wouldnt fall under what dawkins describes as child abuse hes talking about applying religious labels to small children and teaching them traumatic dogmas such as almost all of humanitys being doomed to hell not the mere act of exposing them to religion
4658498 being fondled by the priest simply left the impression from the mind of a 7 year old as yuchy while the memory of my friend going to hell was one of cold immeasurable fear i never lost sleep because of the priest but i spent many a night being terrified that the people i loved would go to hell it gave me nightmares
4658499 again it seems that youre going by the accusations leveled against
4658500 a case could be made that children should be protected by law against verbal abuse such as hell fire scaring as well as physical abuse
4658501 the evidence again i have is confrontation works being rude works being direct works not being especially diplomatic works sure maybe not always but frequently enough
4658502 atheists are hellbound amoral fools who will get your children damned and cause society to collapse
4658503 maybe just maybe one day your wake up and realize that your a 50 year old man who whines complains and bitches life an immature child about stupid shit that your cant control like other peoples thoughts opinions and their perceptions of reality all the while realizing the futility of your constant ramblings regarding something that doesnt even exist within the framework of this godless universe
4658504 control other peoples thoughts opinions and their perceptions of reality
4658505 ive been relatively nice to folks trying to fit their god into gaps where it dissolved entirely slowly pointed this out to them had them admit to me and themselves as much
4658506 the matter is more tighter upon a scholar than when one clenches his fist tightly even though the ignorant person is not excused because of his ignorance i e he will be held to account also however the scholar will receive a greater punishment if he abandons what he has knowledge of and doesnt act upon it
4658507 and whosoever does an atoms weight of good he shall see it and whosoever does an atoms weight of evil he shall see it
4658508 and those who have been left alone in the society 4 36
4658509 those whose hard earned income is insufficient to meet their needs
4658510 imagine another animal that took injury for health or big for small or fast for slow or dead for alive its unlikely that such a species could survive
4658511 through countless generations of variation and selection organisms acquire properties that enable them to survive and reproduce in their environments my purpose is to see if human groups in general and religious groups in particular qualify as organismic in this sense
4658512 speakers were bill bechtel uc san diego alex rosenberg duke marcel weber basel ingo brigandt alberta mark colyvan sydney stephen downes utah karola stotz indiana james tabery pittsburgh and rasmus winther unam mexico city plus a host of people from around australia
4658513 i certainly hope the lord will now bless us with a child after this wonderful night
4658514 if not we may be forced to repeat this beautiful experience
4658515 are these people trying to raise another generation of sexual neurotics
4658516 i asked her to marry me and she said yes then i asked if i could kiss her and she said yes so i kissed her for the first time
4658517 include another couple you will find that physical issues are much less distracting if you plan most of your situations to include other couples
4658518 how do you know the man is any good unless you try him out first
4658519 but i think rumspringa of the sort you describe is something of an urban or perhaps rural legend
4658520 how do people stay sane after such a bizarre upbringing or do they
4658521 it is great to be married to your best friend
4658522 if a christian man is kissing his date and it gives him an erection often just the possibility of a kiss can do this is god or his date being honored
4658523 if a christian man is kissing his date and it gives him an erection often just the possibility of a kiss can do this is god or his date being honored
4658524 these christians are a bunch of sad sexually repressed pathetic individuals
4658525 no wonder whats the point if youre not even going to french
4658526 my doctor called me a liar because he couldnt believe that there were people that dont drink smoke or have sex in this day and age
4658527 adult diapers bibs and bonnets and directed to take their clothes off and put the diapers bibs and bonnets on
4658528 the boys returned to the group where they were asked to sit in the laps of three girls the girls spoon fed baby food to the boys and then gave them baby bottles filled with soda pop the first boy to finish was the winner
4658529 but shes in third grade she doesnt even have any idea what lascivious means
4658530 parental controls are not just for kids if you are a wife then youll also be happy to know safe eyes parental control filtering solution also provide a great way for you to help protect your husband from pornography simply set the password and the password reminder without your husband having access to the filtering software control panel hell thank you over and over
4658531 i cant afford the monthly payments how about a three year lease
4658532 just think how magical that first kiss will be if it is saved for your wedding day
4658533 im glad you said its okay to wait before sex because even though i kind of want to wait im soooooo horny right now
4658534 is this healthy for the man to get sexually aroused time after time without sexual release
4658535 when you completely occlude like that you get a much deeper level than just falling asleep from having lain on something
4658536 i cant afford the monthly payments how about a three year lease
4658537 no problem if youre not interested in eternal salvation but the connection between sexual immorality and loss of belief also a demonstratable fact
4658538 it is such a privilege to announce the upcoming expansions for two of our most popular games everquest and everquest ii in a venue like fan faire where we are joined by thousands of our loyal fans and it seems more than appropriate to give those fans access to both of the expansions for free
4658539 both of these expansions are rich in content and adventure and will provide our players with hours of excitement as they explore the online world of norrath

4658546 essentially this boils down to love we love each other we now have equal rights under the law
4658547 ive been waiting for this all my life this is a life affirming moment
4658548 in contrast to earlier times our state now recognizes that an individuals capacity to establish a loving and long term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individuals sexual orientation
4658549 its about human dignity its about human rights its about time in california
4658550 as california goes so goes the rest of the nation its inevitable this doors wide open now its going to happen whether you like it or not
4658551 were obviously very disappointed in the decision the remedy is a constitutional amendment the constitution defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman
4658552 will not support an amendment to the constitution that would overturn this state supreme court ruling
4658553 nows groundbreaking ceremony commemorates an significant growth milestone for chrysler class action amp for the city of trenton

4658558 uaw members at trenton come 100 percent dedicated to quality and were excited to participate around building the next generation of fuel effective engines for chryslers smashing line up of vehicles
4658559 atheists who account for about 3 percent of the u s population offer a glaring exception to the rule of increasing social tolerance over the last 30 years
4658560 it seems most americans believe that diversity is fine as long as every one shares a common core of values that make them trustworthy and in america that core has historically been religious
4658561 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
4658562 scientists are not at all qualified to speak about those beliefs that have nothing to do with factual claims about the physical universe but instead concern morals ethics values priorities and feelings of individuals
4658563 i have seen no empirical evidence for a god or gods but that doesnt mean they arent there
4658564 all religious belief is inherently stupid and so are all religious believers
4658565 but countering that frame that evolution atheism should not stop here we also need to attack the basis as well the notion that atheism leads to some horrible collapse of morality
4658566 this truly is one of the things that annoys me most i cannot write anything about science and religion without getting inundated with this nonsense where one side thinks that dawkins represents all atheists and the other side thinks that all religious people are like pat robertson
4658567 from now on its law derived from we the people
4658568 and there was evening and there was morning the first second day
4658569 how good is the history of the bible in general
4658570 do i know that the bible is trustworthy on spiritual issues
4658571 how good is the history of the bible in general
4658572 do i know that the bible is trustworthy on spiritual issues
4658573 hellenistic jews were treating the opening chapters of genesis as allegorical long before the birth of jesus and as many of the geneologies explain later relations between the children of israel and their neighbors it is easy to see allegory here as well
4658574 well as a christian i had assumed that i already had the responsibility to ask those questions frankly i would be surprised if the texts hadnt been affected by the culture and history of the peoples it portrays
4658575 how good is the history of the bible in general
4658576 do i know that the bible is trustworthy on spiritual issues
4658577 pursuing a course of action that has a desired result
4658578 only believing that which has good proof or evidentiary grounds
4658579 oh yeah this is complete nonsense but i believe it because it makes me happy
4658580 i dont worship a book if i did that would be truly irrational i worship a god who in my estimation is worthy of worship
4658581 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
4658582 show me evidence that anyone that believes in a supernatural being is wrong
4658583 if the pope has a spokesman whats wrong with atheism having a spokesman
4658584 i want to know gods thoughts the rest are mere details
4658585 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses
4658586 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4658587 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4658588 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4658589 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4658590 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4658591 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4658592 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4658593 nike is not known as an exemplary employer and the malaysian government thousands of workers have been exploited cheated stepped on and abused and the government has not been bothered
4658594 it was the environmentalists the animal rights activists the human rights groups the consumer movements the unionists and other labour activists who put their cases together and forced the creation of such codes
4658595 but ultimately even such codes will not solve the problems faced by workers in this country until the government changes its attitude towards workers changes the laws and fixes all the loopholes that allow such problems to continue
4658596 if he had first ordered investigations and then came out to reject the reported abuses at least we could respect his effort to verify but without doing so hes just appeared defensive and reactionary just like his predecessors
4658597 verite prepares social compliance audits for clients determining industry code infringements
4658598 recommendations are made with specific execution timelines if factories choose to ignore the recommendations they risk losing the client
4658599 mncs would rather pull out than stay with a factory whose poor working conditions would eventually appear in the media they would prefer to resolve it before the press is involved
4658600 in the end the ball is in the hands of the government
4658601 companies take the easy way out they do not regard them as employees despite them wearing the company uniform and working on their premises
4658602 we have our candidate anwar whether we will complete this process of transformation will be determined by permatang pauh voters they not only decide for themselves but for 27 million malaysians
4658603 manusia bodoh setelah semua keburukan yang dia lakukan lantas dia bisa lalu begitu saja dan bahagia
4658604 tak ada satupun yang luput dari timbangan alamsemesta adalah hakim seadil adilnya
4658605 two people with a rolling white board and a cafe space down the road becomes a company
4658606 we wouldnt have done this unless we knew there was a demand
4658607 its exactly the type of business we should be supporting in the downtown
4658608 as a child i always wanted to know the cause of misery of mankind and thought that if sorrow is a truth then there must be a cause and a way out
4658609 i realize my purpose is to console to personally wipe away tears through selfless love compassion and service
4658610 compassion to the poor and the needy is our duty to god
4658611 hey i took the boys tuesday night and i went tonight
4658612 and what is wisdom wisdom is knowing we are all one love is what it feels like and compassion is what it acts like
4658613 when i was diagnosed with a terminal disease all and checked in to the hospital for emergency treatment there was nobody there for me to call on to advocate for me or to assist me with finding or evaluating treatment possibilities
4658614 the surrendered state of consciousness opens up the vertical dimension in your life the dimension of depth
4658615 i absolutely love the process between the blessing bowl and rubbing the joy stone many times during the day especially while driving or standing in lines at the store i feel like i am walking around in a much higher vibration of love joy and truth than ever before everything is flowing ever so smoothly in my life and i feel so much lighter i have already manifested two items in my blessing bowl
4658616 i feel that it would be great to connect with other mis who are in the same boat as i am perhaps we could form a group and use yahoo chat to connect all of us distant mis there must be other mis all over the world who are winging it alone like me and those are the ones i would like to connect with
4658617 i dont want to go anywhere pbs would have a special program on
4658618 bryed ive seen a painting and i have to have it can i buy it
4658619 well its a mermaid but thats not the point its the most beautiful painting and this artist is going to be someone
4658620 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4658621 if you found the biggest diamond in the world who would you call
4658622 do you think these men would have come this far for a hoax
4658623 they aint gonna believe it until they go up and kiss it on the mouth
4658624 was to give the psychos something to do over the weekend
4658625 are there a lot of psychos in the bigfoot community
4658626 im not saying the state bar doesnt have the right to look at us
4658627 but its a concern for me as leader of a das office we are human and sometimes were going to make mistakes
4658628 while things may be legal they may not be the level of practice id want
4658629 id want to see that ben knew the difference as prosecutors we are held to a higher standard
4658630 ive never had a problem with ben being honest with me
4658631 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4658632 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4658633 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4658634 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4658635 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4658636 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4658637 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4658638 he paid for it he paid for the work that was absolutely necessary
4658639 making that connection is absolutely in bounds and we would be remiss if we didnt
4658640 fails to reject this contribution she is aiding and abetting this corrupt behavior
4658641 were proud to have the support of annies list and 5 000 women donors from across the state and we share their mission to empower and protect women and children
4658642 mr baron was helping out a friend the person he was helping out has nothing to do with texas politics is not involved with texas politics and the same goes for former sen edwards
4658643 to see is not to know to hear is not to experience to do is no to learn to have a will is to do all three at once
4658644 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined
4658645 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there
4658646 the damage that has been done to peoples mental and physical health by detaining them in remote high security detention centres such as this has been documented repeatedly
4658647 and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness
4658648 sorry for all the mondays and to those who cant sing

4658653 it finally happened i dont think my wife has stopped crying
4658654 we barely got there in time because track opened today so we came in nervous our knees were going and everyones trembling
4658655 i told him youve always been good but now you can call yourself great
4658656 when he did walk out there for the 200 im he was really rubbing his legs
4658657 i knew his legs were shot we were hoping for second and he just missed that by one hundredth of a second behind hungarys laszlo cseh if he had a couple more meters i think we wouldve gotten that
4658658 he had been very ill they were concerned about him even finishing a 400
4658659 its probably my downfall but ive been doing it so long eating whatever actually tastes good so yeah ive been eating mcdonalds almost every meal here
4658660 every time i get in the water and race michael phelps or aaron or anyone for that matter i always feel like i can win thats just the way ive been trained in my mind i feel like i can win no matter what the race is no matter what the event is i wanted to but it just didnt happen
4658661 it finally happened i dont think my wife has stopped crying
4658662 we barely got there in time because track opened today so we came in nervous our knees were going and everyones trembling
4658663 i told him youve always been good but now you can call yourself great
4658664 when he did walk out there for the 200 im he was really rubbing his legs
4658665 i knew his legs were shot we were hoping for second and he just missed that by one hundredth of a second behind hungarys laszlo cseh if he had a couple more meters i think we wouldve gotten that
4658666 he had been very ill they were concerned about him even finishing a 400
4658667 its probably my downfall but ive been doing it so long eating whatever actually tastes good so yeah ive been eating mcdonalds almost every meal here
4658668 every time i get in the water and race michael phelps or aaron or anyone for that matter i always feel like i can win thats just the way ive been trained in my mind i feel like i can win no matter what the race is no matter what the event is i wanted to but it just didnt happen
4658669 we were just crying and everyone was saying he did it
4658670 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4658671 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4658672 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4658673 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4658674 a crian a que pensa em fadas e acredita nas fadas age como um deus doente mas como um deus porque embora afirme que existe o que n o existe sabe como que as coisas existem que existindo sabe que existir existe e n o se explica sabe que n o h raz o nenhuma para nada existir sabe que ser estar em algum ponto s n o sabe que o pensamento n o um ponto qualquer
4658675 the mental emotional physical effort it takes to perform in that many races is incredible the effort it takes even in prelims you have to show up even michael it makes me impressed with michael even more than i already was
4658676 michael is kind of making the rest of us look
4658677 he makes it look like its a gold medal or nothing
4658678 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4658679 the mental emotional physical effort it takes to perform in that many races is incredible the effort it takes even in prelims you have to show up even michael it makes me impressed with michael even more than i already was
4658680 michael is kind of making the rest of us look
4658681 he makes it look like its a gold medal or nothing
4658682 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4658683 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and shut it off
4658684 i just came to run and do what i can do
4658685 i cant be too mad because thats all i had today so im just happy that i was in contention until the last little bit when they started pulling away all in all it was a good experience
4658686 it was just that i gave them too much in the beginning in the sense that between the 800 and 1 200 meter mark they had a little gap with this caliber of guys you cant really make up that gap in the last 300 meters thats what i got myself into but im still happy
4658687 i didnt get it done when i needed to i guess i went out there in the third round when i was in 10th place and hit a throw that got me into the eight man final it may be a small minor minute victory but at least i showed that when the pressures on i can at least do something
4658688 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and shut it off
4658689 i just came to run and do what i can do
4658690 i cant be too mad because thats all i had today so im just happy that i was in contention until the last little bit when they started pulling away all in all it was a good experience
4658691 it was just that i gave them too much in the beginning in the sense that between the 800 and 1 200 meter mark they had a little gap with this caliber of guys you cant really make up that gap in the last 300 meters thats what i got myself into but im still happy
4658692 i didnt get it done when i needed to i guess i went out there in the third round when i was in 10th place and hit a throw that got me into the eight man final it may be a small minor minute victory but at least i showed that when the pressures on i can at least do something
4658693 i know that i was more than capable of hitting a throw to potentially win but potentially doesnt win championships so you kind of have to do it
4658694 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4658695 this is a planning took where all things are going
4658696 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4658697 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4658698 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4658699 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4658700 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4658701 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4658702 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4658703 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4658704 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4658705 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4658706 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4658707 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4658708 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4658709 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4658710 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4658711 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4658712 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4658713 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4658714 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4658715 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4658716 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4658717 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4658718 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4658719 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4658720 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4658721 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4658722 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4658723 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4658724 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4658725 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4658726 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4658727 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4658728 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4658729 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4658730 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4658731 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4658732 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4658733 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4658734 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4658735 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4658736 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4658737 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4658738 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4658739 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4658740 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4658741 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4658742 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4658743 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4658744 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4658745 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4658746 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4658747 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4658748 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4658749 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4658750 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4658751 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4658752 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4658753 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4658754 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4658755 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4658756 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4658757 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4658758 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4658759 is there a way to make the feature work on an entire project or solution
4658760 why havent women found the perfect man cause no man has a dick made of chocolate that ejaculates money
4658761 es una acci n desesperada de los que el domingo fueron derrotados por la democracia por el voto mayoritario y por los dos tercios del voto que le han dicho al presidente evo morales adelante con el proceso de cambio y dialogue
4658762 esperamos que estos peque os grupos de sectores con discapacidad puedan reflexionar no se hagan manipular pol ticamente por personas fracasadas y esperen la aprobaci n de la ley
4658763 en las cercan as de r os arroyos y ca adas deben tomar las medidas de precauci n contra desbordamientos
4658764 yo no estaba esperando tanta agua fue una sorpresa ahora se me complica llegar a la casa
4658765 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4658766 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4658767 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4658768 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4658769 hes going to go out and try to play catch and see if he can put some pressure on it my gut is that he wont pitch in this weekend series
4658770 and someone said he was going to throw a little bit thats good wed certainly like to have him back but we want to make sure hes ok too we dont want to get him back here and get him out there and then he suffers another setback
4658771 i think the biggest thing is just being able to strengthen it and rest it
4658772 from what ive been told he pitches with an aggressive style and comes at you
4658773 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4658774 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4658775 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4658776 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4658777 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4658778 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4658779 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4658780 especially in my last start that one against cleveland at home on sept 11 i dont know if i even got out of the third or fourth inning
4658781 it was weird because i didnt feel any different i felt like i still had the stuff where i could give us a chance to win i just wasnt doing it
4658782 maybe i fell into some sort of pattern or whatnot last year and the word got out
4658783 i think this year adding the cutter slider it has been huge
4658784 this the cutter has been another pitch i can get over last year i really struggled with getting my curveball over so i was just a two pitch pitcher hitters pretty much knew it was either a fastball or changeup coming
4658785 obviously its a very special thing to get drafted anyway but to have him drafted and signed by the white sox i know hes going to feel a lot more comfortable that i will be there
4658786 hes a good ballplayer but hes a minor league guy and going to have to work his way up but we couldnt be happier as a family
4658787 for where hes come from over the first three or four weeks hes been terrific
4658788 any time they mentioned his name theyd tell about the upside and everybody wondered when it would happen now were seeing it and you can see it in his eyes hes a little more sure of himself now with a regular plan at the plate
4658789 what i see in this kid is not easy to do hes made a transition while the games going on when the season is going on its not easy to do it takes a lot of confidence on the part of the player to trust himself and put it into play hes a really changed player for me give him a lot of credit for doing that
4658790 basically hes saying is that hes seen improvement hes seen me get better each day and thats what im supposed to do im not supposed to get worse
4658791 i feel different than last year im not saying im smarter but i get it this year i know better what to look for in certain situations in the beginning of the season half of my at bats were bad thats the main thing im having better at bats and making the pitchers pitch
4658792 hes always talking about what the pitcher is doing hey hes one of the best right handed hitters in the game who better to listen to he talks about baseball all the time i try to learn from people that have been there and done that they know what it takes to succeed
4658793 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4658794 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4658795 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4658796 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4658797 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4658798 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4658799 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4658800 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4658801 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4658802 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4658803 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4658804 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4658805 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4658806 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4658807 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4658808 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4658809 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4658810 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4658811 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4658812 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4658813 i think the biggest thing is there when there have been quotes in the paper saying thats its impossible to ever tie or break his record it just shows you anythings possible
4658814 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought i had lost the race
4658815 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the 1 was next to my name then when i saw 50 58 and 50 59 with the 1 next to my name thats when i let out my roar
4658816 after seeing that race and seeing this race i guess my two finishes over the last four years have been pretty good and have been at the right time
4658817 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4658818 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4658819 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4658820 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4658821 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4658822 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4658823 deja de momento siete muertos y medio centenar de heridos entre ellos diecisiete que est n muy mal gravemente heridos
4658824 un bandido del frente 18 de las farc hizo explotar el artefacto para cometer este cobarde ataque

4658828 it was ugly for me personally thats not how i hope to feel

4658854 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4658855 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4658856 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4658857 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4658871 the script is very true to the characters were not talking about putting nipples on the trapjaw suit but we had to come up with a reason again why trapjaw would actually not just be something thats totally absurd but why he would need those bionic parts added to him

4658888 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4658889 every one of russias neighbors feels less secure today than it did a week ago this is going to mean that theyre going to want help from the outside
4658890 a greater western military presence in the region is not something russia wanted but by its own actions russia has forced this to happen now and the west will respond to this

4658911 basically were seeing ears of corn with no kernels on the first two to three inches
4658912 if the plant doesnt think it can sustain a large number of kernels it aborts pollinated kernels
4658913 we still have the potential for a good crop maybe not a bin buster like we had last year but it could still be good
4658914 you have to remember last year at harvest time we had 3 a bushel corn
4658915 the world interpreted religiously is not the materialistic world over again with an altered expression it must have over and above the altered expression a natural constitution different at some point from that which a materialistic world would have it must be such that different events can be expected in it different conduct must be required this thoroughly pragmatic view of religion has usually been taken as a matter of course by common men they have interpolated divine miracles into the field of nature they have built a heaven out beyond the grave it is only transcendentalist metaphysicians who think that without adding any concrete details to nature or subtracting any but by simply calling it the expression of absolute spirit you make it more divine just as it stands i believe the pragmatic way of taking religion to be the deeper way it gives it body as well as soul it makes it claim as everything real must claim some characteristic realm of fact as its very own what the more characteristically divine facts are apart from the actual inflow of energy in the faith state and the prayer state i know not
4658916 but the over belief on which i am ready to make my personal venture is that they exist the whole drift of my education goes to persuade me that the world of our present consciousness is only one out of many worlds of consciousness that exist and that those other worlds must contain experiences which have a meaning for our life also and that although in the main their experiences and those of this world keep discrete yet the two become continuous at certain points and higher energies filter in by being faithful in my poor measure to this over belief i seem to myself to keep more sane and true i can of course put myself into the sectarian scientists attitude and imagine vividly that the world of sensations and of scientific laws and objects may be all but whenever i do this i hear that inward monitor of which w k clifford once wrote whispering the word bosh humbug is humbug even though it bear the scientific name and the total expression of human experience as i view it objectively invincibly urges me beyond the narrow scientific bounds assuredly the real world is of a different temperament more intricately built than physical science allows so my objective and my subjective conscience both hold me to the over belief which i express who knows whether the faithfulness of individuals here below to their own poor over beliefs may not actually help god in turn to be more effectively faithful to his own greater tasks
4658917 by supernatural we understand beliefs claiming origins other than verifiable experiences or events contrary to known processes in nature science and miracles are incompatible
4658918 modern science does not believe that the course of nature can be interrupted or so to speak perforated by supernatural powers
4658919 now of course we must agree with hume that if there is absolutely uniform experience if in other words they have never happened why then they never have unfortunately we know the experience against them to be uniform only if we know that all reports of them have been false and we can know all the reports of them to be false only if we know already that miracles have never occurred in fact we are arguing in a circle
4658920 everything we observe needs a cause so the universe must need a cause
4658921 this is a universe of contingencies thus it is a contingent universe
4658922 were going to look at our options we want to make sure we have the strong legal evidence to prevent the governor from moving before we do any filing

4658929 this entire road from butterfield stage all the way out is just bad all the way around
4658930 its a little safer here at least there is a shoulder but they need turning lanes or slower speeds or something
4658931 it is a two lane road with curves in it
4658932 but if you drive in a way that is appropriate for the road its not unsafe collisions occur because someone was doing something they werent supposed to do 99 percent of the time

4658935 substituted candidates for several who qualified for the ballot by the aug 8 deadline but later withdrew
4658936 which may be the vehicle for getting ralph nader on the ballot
4658937 said backers of the party have indicated they will continue gathering signatures
4658938 minor parties dont necessarily need to hold a convention which requires 10 days notice to nominate candidates they could for example write bylaws allowing a nominating process by email so this could give the party more flexibility to qualify a candidate before the aug 26 deadline for getting on the november ballot

4658961 just a few weeks ago predictions of arctic ice collapse were buzzing all over the internet some scientists were predicting that the north pole may be ice free for first time this summer others predicted that the entire polar ice cap would disappear this summer
4658962 the arctic melt season is nearly done for this year the sun is now very low above the horizon and will set for the winter at the north pole in five weeks and none of these dire predictions have come to pass yet there is however something odd going on with the ice data

4658993 we must be conscious that there is a war on the roadways of the entire world where everyday hundreds of people die for many different reasons immediate intervention is needed to reduce the number of victims because it is becoming a real destruction it will not be easy but it is a challenge that should be faced with great determination

4658995 the most important thing to keep in mind is that the church is committed to raising awareness and helping people who use the road to gain a sense of responsibility to decrease traffic accidents the contribution of the christian community is necessary but in addition to the church schools families and institutions must also work to further this cause and work to create respect for applicable laws
4658996 the scary statistics we hear on the television and read in the daily newspapers that demonstrate a lack of respect for life that is why we have called this summit in october in bogot to look for a way to confront the problem it will begin with the continental conference and will later focus on the parish and diocesan environments another important topic tied to the street is that of children being forced to beg or rummage through garbage

4659113 ive had a good feeling all day especially this afternoon and im having so much fun
4659114 the speed was there this morning but on the second loop things went even better
4659115 it was slippery in the narrow sections and where the surface changed especially on the opening stage and i dont think ive ever been as sideways on asphalt as i was this morning when its dry the car feels great and i hope i can take that feeling into the second leg tomorrows stages are fast and the tests on the baumholder military land will be tricky
4659116 i had a lot more confidence this afternoon with the harder springs
4659117 a top five position was my target tonight i want to maintain that tomorrow because i know it will be difficult to catch the guys ahead the baumholder stages will be tough tomorrow and even though they are difficult they are enjoyable to drive i hope it stays dry because they arent quite so nice in the wet
4659118 my pace notes were prepared for a wet rally and its been dry
4659119 in stage four i knocked 20sec off my morning time almost a second per kilometre i was all set to try and do the same in stage five but i was stopped on the start line because of gigis crash stage six was also cancelled so it was a frustrating afternoon
4659120 its the most competitive mikko has been on asphalt and the new car has run really well his second place isnt just down to the improvements of the car mikko has improved a lot on this surface im pleased with how jari matti has approached this event and built his confidence as the day progressed it was a strong performance from both drivers

4659130 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

4659254 but all you have to do is walk around the neighborhoods around here and see all the boarded up houses and given the tough economy my principals have told me many families are moving away to the south or the west or where they have relatives
4659255 i see two or three foreclosed homes on every street
4659256 many of these families drive without licenses and when the state police started stopping people earlier this year and bringing them to court people got scared also the economic situation in the state is grave the cost of food and gasoline and everything is going up many of these people earn just 6 an hour so all of this has created a situation where they cannot maintain their lives here
4659257 i dont think the executive order was signed in order to force people to leave the state although that could very well be a consequence of it
4659258 if so i say thats great congratulations to the governor because we are gaining something here in rhode island if its forcing some people to leave
4659259 is that like many doctors before him hell be able to return to safe practice at some point in the future

4659280 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4659281 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4659282 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4659283 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4659284 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4659285 weve got six weeks to convince local mps that this proposal is not in the interests of the people of nsw and remind them of the promise that they gave in the lead up to the last election to maintain public ownership of electricity assets in nsw

4659291 eligi la mejor localidad de galilea la orilla occidental del lago de genesaret junto a las caldas de ema s pero la selecci n del lugar fue en este sentido desafortunada como result evidente por las ope raciones de desescombro durante las que aparecieron varios monumentos funerarios se trataba de un antiguo cementerio y en cuanto tal estaba prohibido como lugar de vivienda pa ra los jud os observantes cualquier contacto con tumbas los hac a ritualmente impuros durante siete d as

4659300 i think it shows how bad our trade agreements have worked here we are at the northern border and we have indigenous women dressed in their traditional dresses
4659301 were involved with all the community and part of the community doesnt speak spanish
4659302 youd find somebody and theyd be speaking what you thought was spanish but youd find that its something else thats not spanish
4659303 officers learn to be more patient the workers are speaking a dialect that might not be as common

4659314 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4659315 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have

4659318 the big question is not what pervez musharraf is going to do but whats going to happen to him next
4659319 i dont think he can be given safe passage anywhere except to jail if you think about it it would be a problem for any country to take him in because al qaeda has said that he will be unsafe wherever he goes
4659320 reports from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and air force reserve hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the low pressure area over the mona passage became a tropical storm as it moved into the eastern dominican republic
4659321 the center of fay will cross hispaniola tonight and saturday and pass near or over eastern cuba saturday night and sunday
4659322 today is a day of pride and it will be written with golden letters in the history of the nation

4659325 the election of pushpa kamal dahal as the prime minister ends a period of uncertainty and paves the way for government formation
4659326 we dont like the way you are doing this so were going to cut off your natural gas supplies
4659327 some sad incidents happened at a time when we had a boom in the tourism industry it is as if the sun had set at noon
4659328 my effort will be bring the leaders of the agitation to the table so that all the problems are resolved
4659329 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4659330 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4659331 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4659332 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4659333 a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
4659334 we agree with the mediation but we dont think that people who are in these negotiations should be attending as if they have won an election
4659335 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4659336 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take

4659338 my sisters suggested i send these two photos to you of sleeping cats
4659339 nestled in a scenic curve of the allegheny river the city of warren ranked second on the 2007 list of best places to live in rural america
4659340 is what we affectionately call a cat pile and to make it texas friendly the white cat was adopted from
4659341 hes actually an ebony smoke our first oriental shorthair and he came from a small breeder in warren ohio where the cats are raised in the home and are very well socialized
4659342 ladybug is the blue eyed white cat a texas lady who arrived in our home june 30 of 2007
4659343 we had just lost our very special kitty my heart kitty and soul mate after a really rough three years fighting feline diabetes
4659344 both donna and marlene bean my other sister are very active in the coppell humane society
4659345 the three were pulled and placed in a foster home where they became marc anthony julius caesar and cleopatra
4659346 as soon as my sisters found out about the new fosters they called us here in pennsylvania to let us know if we wanted cleopatra we could have her just fill out the paperwork
4659347 we already had another cat 9 year old long haired seal point bali hai that we had adopted from coppell 8 years ago so they were familiar with us already
4659348 long story short after a rough couple if weeks orientals and siamese dont take well to change all three ended up staying with a local vet to keep them eating
4659349 we had been a four cat family up until august 2007 when chester my almost 17 year old tabby passed away quietly one night
4659350 on the way to meet bobo a two hour drive we talked about what we could do we knew there were some health issues just not what they were and could we afford to take him into our family
4659351 when we got there we were shocked to see a brown skeleton walking unsteadily to meet us the previous owners had let his teeth get so bad that they bled when he tried to eat
4659352 neither jerry nor i could resist that little fellow who tried so hard to do his duty of meeting and greeting us so even though we said no health issues we couldnt leave him there
4659353 he came home with us after spending time quarantined in an upstairs bedroom and experimenting with what foods he could eat and would eat battling ringworm and just getting used to our household he was turned lose and the first cat pile appeared
4659354 he is the official meeter greeter and the only cat in the house that the grandchildren ages 11 3 and 1 can get near the cat piles are a daily occurrence here and i love to see them
4659355 the other members of our furry family are the already mentioned bali hai a gorgeous longhaired seal point with blue eyes that cant believe that she has to put up with those homely orientals and gyro the cocker spaniel dachshund mix we adopted in october of 2006 from our local shelter warren county humane society
4659356 gyro lives with four cats and sometimes i think he forgets hes a dog as many times you will find him perched on one of the lower levels of the cat tree watching the birds and squirrels at the feeders
4659357 so this is our little family jerry is a factory maintenance millwright and i work out of our home now where my studio is located after 27 years as an art photo director and catalog designer for a mail order company
4659358 she will continue postoperative recovery while some additional testing is being performed

4659365 thunderbird will ship with qute we would have liked to have a companion winstripe theme for thunderbird 1 0 but there isnt time
4659366 netscape messenger 4 feel of thunderbird i wish that the ui had been burnt down and redesigned from the ground up as firefox was there seem to be many opportunities for simplification in the menus preferences and settings windows perhaps this is coming

4659376 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4659377 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4659378 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
4659379 i will turn the tv when i see those because its so unrealistic of the individuals that are going there
4659380 yeah its very convenient but i mean the prices arent
4659381 these places around here charging outrageous fees and surcharges or whatever
4659382 i know several people and theyve over extended their funds and it really cost them a lot of money and they really got in a lot of trouble that way
4659383 if an individual wants to borrow 100 dollars and pay 15 dollars on that short term loan and pay it back in two weeks for something like a co pay for a health care cost they should be allowed to make that decision
4659384 by taking this industry and limiting the amount of profit that they can make its going to put this industry out of business and with it six thousand good paying jobs

4659407 im so happy god answered prayer and now that we know his name we can pray for him
4659408 hes a bit older than me got some gray hairs and seems to know the right verse to give me or the right book to suggest reading
4659409 the way you said that i could tell you have respect and admiration for this man
4659410 jason why dont you write a post in that magazine of yours and make sure your friend gets a copy tell him you dedicate it to him so he knows how much you appreciate him
4659411 its so nice when you work so hard and it pays off i wasnt expecting that i am so pleased
4659412 i knew would be tough and was expecting a battle but when i knew i was clear i felt i could go for the time

4659416 wow did you see her boobs they are huge shake that junk hahahahaa lol i think she had segurgy on her boobs
4659417 its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient
4659418 appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
4659419 its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks
4659420 and its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks hes been in contact with the leaders involved in these places for many many years so its really sort of a perfect thing for him and so the question is each time something like this pops up randomly we may see a cautiousness on the one hand by senator obama who has not been dealing with these things for years and maybe a little more aggressive voice from senator mccain and ill just tell you his favorite thing to say about vladimir putin is when i look into his eyes i see a k a g and a b hes been very very tough on putin for quite some time
4659421 can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
4659422 this isnt right hes not right for our country and i wont stand for it
4659423 his obamas supporters are now suffering a pre denver panic attack watching as john mccain draws incrementally closer in state and national polls with rasmussens most recent daily tracker showing a statistical dead heat
4659424 how much does his race factor into tightening contests in missouri wisconsin florida minnesota and ohio nobody knows and thats the problem
4659425 mccain has quietly crept up over the past month and could vault ahead if he anoints ex gov mitt romney as his running mate
4659426 nobody wants a pair of pelosis nancy and barack running things
4659427 want change but im not sure that the democratic agenda has the support of a majority of americans
4659428 230 000 reasons lieberman is not acceptable to the gop as vp
4659429 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4659430 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4659431 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4659432 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4659433 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4659434 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4659435 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4659436 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4659437 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4659438 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4659439 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4659440 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4659441 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4659442 you never really know a guy until you stare at him for 8 hours through high powered binoculars
4659443 i am immortal but the concept of infinity freaks me out
4659444 carter is also correct when he criticizes the governments failure to build a high speed rail system which would be much more energy efficient than auto and air traffic he says its the kind of issue that should be debated in the senate today so the planning can start as soon as possible
4659445 carter has also taken an interesting approach on health care promoting federal catastrophic insurance coverage for everyone such a system would likely help the economy by reducing the number of bankruptcies people file due to high medical bills
4659446 youve got guys coming from st louis detroit los angeles georgia brooklyn the bronx
4659447 queensland has looked overseas for innovations that will help us improve health care delivery in the face of a worldwide shortage of doctors
4659448 physicians assistants will extend the capacity of our highly skilled medical workforce
4659449 we need to provide the best possible training for junior doctors and for doctors to gain experience they must have opportunities to see patients and do procedures
4659450 we are concerned if physician assistants are increasingly used they could be substituted for doctors in some of these roles and the training of junior medicos compromised
4659451 now you shouldnt have problems with this one at least i hope
4659452 its probably nine or 10 years old since weve known each other
4659453 its always tough its funny to play each other in the semis here we know each other so well what we like and what we dont like
4659454 i was having problems with my timing but when i made a passing shot on a set point i started feeling better
4659455 i decided to just focus on every point and i started feeling better
4659456 im looking forward to getting some revenge on a different surface
4659457 ive been in casino since 1962 and never won the cup but its a race id love to win
4659458 pay day lass has been a good mare to us and while she might be past her best her work this morning thursday was the best shes worked this time in she did it easy over 800 metres
4659459 she likes her home track and she just might surprise a few people
4659460 its probably unusual for a mare her age to still be racing but the owner peter day has a big property in north queensland and with the drought up there hes had nowhere to keep her
4659461 this is her last go then its off to stud it would be a nice way to go out if she could win
4659462 she got a bit crook after the flu injection but shes come back good
4659463 i would have liked one more run under her belt but i really think shes going better now than this time last year when she ran second
4659464 its always a challenge to get a decent horse and try and get him going again
4659465 since arriving ive been happy with him happy enough to run at casino then look at the byron bay and ballina cups
4659466 id suggest hed improve on what he does on sunday but hes worked with special voyage and instructed and held his own its no secret hes going good
4659467 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4659468 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4659469 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could

4659485 so hopefully we can knock that over this weekend and then if were guaranteed a spot we can try to aim as high as we can
4659486 obviously carlton have got a lot of top draft picks that are midfielders so theyve got a pretty good on ball brigade and we think weve got a pretty good on ball brigade as well
4659487 hit outs are hit outs in the end but it depends where youre putting them well obviously try to give our blokes first use if we can
4659488 but obviously if we can follow up on the ground as well and become an extra midfielder with the tackling and pressure and stuff that weve been working on
4659489 thats going to help the guys like brent harvey obviously around us to get the ball down to our forward line
4659490 we knew we were going to get that role when he went down so we took it on and obviously hes been playing very good footy drewie
4659491 hopefully when mcintosh slots back in we can continue and either drewie can go forward or i can go forward again and we can play there a bit more often
4659492 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4659493 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4659494 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4659495 its probably nine or 10 years old since weve known each other
4659496 its always tough its funny to play each other in the semis here we know each other so well what we like and what we dont like
4659497 i was having problems with my timing but when i made a passing shot on a set point i started feeling better
4659498 i decided to just focus on every point and i started feeling better
4659499 im looking forward to getting some revenge on a different surface
4659500 ive been in casino since 1962 and never won the cup but its a race id love to win
4659501 pay day lass has been a good mare to us and while she might be past her best her work this morning thursday was the best shes worked this time in she did it easy over 800 metres
4659502 she likes her home track and she just might surprise a few people
4659503 its probably unusual for a mare her age to still be racing but the owner peter day has a big property in north queensland and with the drought up there hes had nowhere to keep her
4659504 this is her last go then its off to stud it would be a nice way to go out if she could win
4659505 she got a bit crook after the flu injection but shes come back good
4659506 i would have liked one more run under her belt but i really think shes going better now than this time last year when she ran second
4659507 its always a challenge to get a decent horse and try and get him going again
4659508 since arriving ive been happy with him happy enough to run at casino then look at the byron bay and ballina cups
4659509 id suggest hed improve on what he does on sunday but hes worked with special voyage and instructed and held his own its no secret hes going good
4659510 it was a cruel terrorist attack to surprise a population as they celebrate
4659511 wed like to wrap up a finals spot to start with i dont think were guaranteed yet
4659512 were just focusing on i think we have to win one more game to make the finals so weve got three chances to do that

4659528 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4659529 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4659530 this is the first known use of cluster munitions since 2006 during israels war with hezbollah in lebanon
4659531 im not saying the state bar doesnt have the right to look at us
4659532 but its a concern for me as leader of a das office we are human and sometimes were going to make mistakes
4659533 while things may be legal they may not be the level of practice id want
4659534 id want to see that ben knew the difference as prosecutors we are held to a higher standard

4659545 expressing the sense of congress regarding the threat posed to international peace stability in the middle east and the vital national security interests of the united states by irans pursuit of nuclear weapons and regional hegemony
4659546 house concurrent resolution 362 and its companion senate resolution 580 pave the way for open war with iran it is that simple and we must be equally clear and bold in our opposition
4659547 look im sure that we all agree that we need to send a clear message to iran that they cannot continue building nuclear weapons and killing our soldiers in iraq
4659548 that is precisely what we do not agree on because neither of those claims has been substantiated and repeating them only propagandizes for war
4659549 included young and old veterans and veteran activists teachers and students

4659552 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4659553 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race

4659555 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4659556 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top

4659564 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4659565 in every way qualified to receive the honour and dignity of knighthood
4659566 it went extremely well and we are delighted that the norwegian guard honoured nils olav with a knighthood
4659567 we all enjoyed the occasion and nils was a perfect penguin throughout
4659568 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
4659569 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
4659570 we are extremely proud of nils olav and pleased that an enduring part of the royal guard is resident in scotland helping to further strengthen ties between our two countries
4659571 we have a long standing history with the norwegian kings guard and it is something we are extremely proud of

4659579 i was asked to read this book for my job
4659580 i proceded to read it untill i got to chapter 7 and when i found that no plot has even erupted yet the entire chapter was about a deer how can a book be seven chapters in and about 100 pages in and still have expostition material this book was terrible and would never suggest to anyone
4659581 wow you really arent very good are you youre certainly not good enough
4659582 harry potter is a pr exercise for paganism one hundred children a month
4659583 she is my age but she looks older doesnt she say yes
4659584 shes my age but how many times do you think i could lap her before that lardass touches the wall
4659585 if you had a question about something scott would help you and hed make you feel like a million bucks afterward
4659586 the best way to characterize scott he had quite a sense of humor
4659587 it was very subtle it wasnt overbearing he always could laugh at a tough situation he would make people feel better about a tough deal
4659588 some people that know their stuff theyll talk down to you make you feel like youre very little but not with scott
4659589 he had quite a good rapport with many officers throughout the entire state hes the type of person that when he taught the class officers were at the edge of their seat the entire time
4659590 he just went out and did his job he was one of the better employees ive ever had the opportunity to know its a big loss for the whole law enforcement community
4659591 but hes one that believed in the laws of the land and he felt like people should live them he lived rules and enforced rules but was also obedient to rules he did everything he could to comply with the laws of god and the laws of man
4659592 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4659593 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4659594 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4659595 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4659596 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4659597 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey
4659598 our police family suffered a devastating loss through aubreys ultimate sacrifice
4659599 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
4659600 its not like theres one person involved there are six
4659601 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4659602 you can make these up to one week in advance
4659603 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4659604 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
4659605 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4659606 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4659607 im a big fan i love your work im absolutely certain
4659608 well the number one thing is to get drunk drivers off the road
4659609 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4659610 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4659611 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf
4659612 the vermont college writers community is so caring and the faculty amazing you cant help but dig in
4659613 do multiroom systems just do mp3s what about my cds
4659614 the community college system is under funded and under supported by the state so when people are taking a lot of time addressing an issue that for pcc impacted only 2 students last year to me it doesnt seem reasonable
4659615 well they ask them hey are you undocumented what do you think yeah im illegal
4659616 drag me out of here and send me across the border
4659617 if we get into having to identify folks and ask for two forms of identification thats a different ball game
4659618 its something that both the state and federal government needs to take charge of and not put the community college system in the role of gatekeeper or enforcer
4659619 success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best that you are capable of becoming
4659620 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings

4659624 we are here to inform you that beneath the sky have decided to throw in the towel and go their separate ways
4659625 we didnt ask chris to be jamey we asked chris to be chris and hes done a great job of that so far
4659626 we want him to bring the qualities that chris has and those are leadership intelligence and hard work
4659627 most of the guys have known me for a few years and they know im pretty smart with the line calls so theyve accepted me
4659628 lauzze has taken on the responsibility of being that guy that center
4659629 it takes somebody special to play that spot i expect him to step right in and do his job
4659630 hes definitely earned that right to be the number one center
4659631 hes paid his dues and he deserves it im very pleased with chris
4659632 this is the best camp weve had since ive been here
4659633 were totally focused on improving upon what we did last season winning a conference championship and making that bowl game
4659634 weve played each other four times this summer here and at sweet home and they won the two regular season games and we won both the two playoff games
4659635 our league is going to be a battle every night this year and this shows that
4659636 we have a lot of team speed so im looking forward to this team and what we can do
4659637 it really raises the level of awareness about swimming both for the casual lap swimmer and for kids interested in learning to swim but it also increases interest in competitive swimming
4659638 its something that michael said he wanted to do four years ago and hes certainly managed to do that
4659639 i wish george tenet had more experience in actual operations like some cia directors because he could have told his bosses in the white house this is a bad idea

4659659 the spread of new ideas in science is mathematically similar to the spread of disease even though one produces positive results the other negative

4659661 dont worry mr amp mrs jones ill take care of that it wont show up on your credit
4659662 calls for moratoria on the consecration of non celibate gay persons to the episcopate same sex unions and boundary crossing poaching intervening by prelates against the wishes permission of a local bishop who is in communion with canterbury
4659663 of gracious restraint as the presiding bishop put it seasons are temporary but by next general convention the episcopal church will have observed the moratorium on gay bishops de facto
4659664 there are places where to be associated with homosexuality is to be associated with evil lives are quite literally in danger
4659665 oh well we never really meant what we said about inclusion that was just a passing fashion were over it now sorry about all the inconvenience
4659666 burgoyne is fully aware that we want to see something from him before the end of the year and him playing well in the sanfl isnt going to prove anything to us
4659667 theres probably no one out there on the field that can do the things peter can do
4659668 wed rather spend time with a player like that rather than one that might never be capable of reaching those heights thats our justification of it
4659669 if we can get peter burgoyne up and running before the end of the year it will be great for port adelaide next year
4659670 were just trying to learn that hes willing able and wanting to play football for port adelaide
4659671 weve put it on him that we want to see something
4659672 his training has really picked up over the last couple of weeks and tonight was better than it has been and thats a fact
4659673 he made some massive blunders that caused goals to be kicked against us by collingwood but we can see his effort
4659674 hes into the game and he wants to be here next year i know that for a fact
4659675 that was our whole focus going into the 2004 draft that wed put together over two or three drafts a group of young players who could hopefully play a lot of footy together
4659676 weve studied a lot of premiership sides over recent times and that has certainly been their experience
4659677 you bring a lot of young kids in to the group at a similar sort of time and then have them grow and build together
4659678 geelong did that themselves through 99 2000 and 2001 they injected some really talented players into their footy club and now theyre getting full benefit from that
4659679 thats been a really good model for us to follow and we think with some of these guys committing to the footy club for the long term that hopefully its a platform for sustained success
4659680 weve had some good contests against the tigers over the last two or three years and wed expect the same tomorrow
4659681 any side thats got matty richardson and troy simmonds and those type of guys in their side is a very formidable opponent
4659682 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday night
4659683 i knew at the beginning of the week it was going to be a low scoring week
4659684 i was close last time and i kept looking at the rankings so im trying to forget about it
4659685 talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4659686 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4659687 of course there isnt power sharing right now but the talks are still going on
4659688 until we find a solution they will continue to go on because sadc doesnt have the luxury of walking away from zimbabwe
4659689 patients are admitted to the medical unit with flimsy medical diagnosis and often have psychiatric needs that are not addressed
4659690 over four years ago dhs made certain allegations about the hospitals admissions policies the city of angels immediately responded to the few isolated deficiencies to the full satisfaction of dhs two subsequent dhs inspections within the year found no further such problems
4659691 is currently undertaking an investigation at city of angels as such we are not commenting further at this time
4659692 did not see their treating physician if at all until well after admission and typically shortly before discharge they were however treated for various medical conditions some real and some not
4659693 when you hear about homeless people coming in and the allegations that they are being exploited for financial gain its very distressing
4659694 thats what the county and state inspectors were concerned about the exploitation of homeless and possibly mentally ill folks
4659695 he provides valuable medical care to an often untreated universe of patients
4659696 it was revealed that patients were being discharged the following day after review because of inadequate criteria for admission to the hospital
4659697 a complete history and physical examination within the designated time frame 24 hours by the attending physician and or his her designee

4659704 black and white photography doesnt get a lot of attention
4659705 this is the first time the featured artist came out of a different category other than painting were really excited about it
4659706 he photographs something familiar and it is offering a new perspective he brings out the detail and interest in them i find that fascinating
4659707 its shot dead center thats a huge no no in photography
4659708 but it sucks you in you wonder where has the train been where is it going you could smell the old and dusty
4659709 black and white is my vision and my voice what i should be doing ultimately its the vision that matters
4659710 usually theres a two to three month lag in processing the film sometimes ive forgotten what i have shot
4659711 when the image comes up for the first time its a wow
4659712 i got into photography as a release from the racing thing
4659713 racing was a career job and i knew the only way to get out of it was to leave
4659714 did you pick up my wallet in the car park
4659715 yes i did i gave it to the fish and chip place because i didnt want it to be outside they should have it
4659716 look you can ask the boys down there if you want but all i did was pick it up and take it to the nearest shop
4659717 all great manifestations of social life have in common with the work of art the fact that they are born in unconscious life

4659832 he said explain to me in detail what youre doing here
4659833 he was concerned about me and he wanted to know step by step what i did
4659834 he noticed mr johns hat that he was a cement mason and they talked about it with him he made it his business to understand

4659838 the two ambulance guys said youre not going to stop us were taking him right now
4659839 i dont remember the first 12 days in the hospital
4659840 all i remember is i got this he fingered a small bump near his mouth because i kept trying to take the ventilator out of my mouth to ask them how eric was and to ask them about aaron smiths then year old son back in dayton

4659851 whether its a racing suit versus a training suit or a new style of helmet theres always some new technological development

4659856 it doesnt return more than 100 percent of energy you put into it its not spring loaded
4659857 the fundamental difference with our technology over traditional footwear is that instead of using compressive materials such as foam the midsole is mechanical and works off of deflection not compression
4659858 its just like the battle with the oversized tennis racket or the metal driver

4659867 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4659868 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4659869 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4659870 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4659871 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4659872 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4659873 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4659874 queensland has looked overseas for innovations that will help us improve health care delivery in the face of a worldwide shortage of doctors

4659876 we need to provide the best possible training for junior doctors and for doctors to gain experience they must have opportunities to see patients and do procedures

4659885 i spoke to mike this week i told him the importance of playing as a second striker is getting involved and i think thats what he did
4659886 one of the things mike has is that he has goals in him
4659887 if you give him chances in the area and he finds himself in a good position he can put the ball away easily i think for him for his confidence the goal is going to be very important
4659888 we said we wanted somebody that could organize the back he did that and he also showed some very good distribution which we have lacked in the past
4659889 i said from the beginning that the newcomers are going to be very important players for us
4659890 the more they play the more confident they will get and the more important theyll become we cannot ask for them to do everything they have introduced themselves very well to the team we have welcomed them with open arms and hopefully they will be as important as everyone thinks theyre going to be

4659898 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill
4659899 we took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators around to our way of thinking but weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach

4659902 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could

4659908 fox news even had to cut them off right in the middle of the account of georgian aggression
4659909 haha that eleven year old girl is stuuupid haha who cares that some fuck was trying to kill them and they had to flee for their lives who gives a shit that it s some child

4659911 at this time its critical for the city to do whatever is necessary so that these residents can resume some sense of normalcy in their neighbourhood after this traumatic event
