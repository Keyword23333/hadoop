3200221 the title is an elegant word that refers to the way we work and hopefully how our music sounds
3200222 were very technically focused yet we aim for our music to have genuine soul and warmth we also do everything in the studio so technique is the key to that
3200223 it was the name of a weird statue that was at a house i used to live at a house that was built in the 1700s
3200224 to be honest i was kind of enjoying it for a while but at the moment id rather keep oblivious keep my head down and not get caught up in it
3200225 very much so i started djing when i was ten years old ive been playing records longer than ive been producing i love to keep it as varied as possible to keep it diverse i like to turn up and play it by ear but not give them what theyre expecting thats not the route i want to go down got to keep em guessing
3200226 i prefer the mainstream stuff to be honest i spent years and years listening to underground hip hop and it hasnt really progressed the way it should have done obviously 80 of mainstream stuff is poor but theres a lot of it that pushes forward more than the so called underground people like danja timbaland polow the don theres a lot of guys that dont really have a name but are coming up right now
3200227 were all friends for me its important to be as diverse as possible and its a scene but its not a scene thats based around one particular sound the basis is instrumental hip hop but i wouldnt say its limited its the same with the dj thing i get a lot of pleasure out of not really allowing it to become a set sort of thing
3200228 the whole concept came out of me moving to ibiza it was an inspired idea i was getting interested in the power of thought i realised going into this spiral of thought about how i was going to get my studio to ibiza i couldnt just get it on a removal truck and i realised i was gonna have to take it myself through having this conversation with a friend i thought if im gonna take the studio myself all the gear i thought it would be worth recording something and that led to the idea of setting up all the equipment in the camper van going through that whole process i realised that that had all manifested from that single thought the album is based around that one thought that became a million experiences and creations that became all the tracks the experience of what happened on the road trip the whole thing thats basically it so it made sense to me calling the album thought so as a result also the definition of whatever you put out there whatever youre thinking about becomes your reality whether thats creating music whether thats how you look at somebody thats all based on what you think
3200229 even though id got the concept and idea of going to do this road trip id already made the decision that i wasnt gonna plan any of the music just see how it all pans out it changed from day to day wed do two tracks in a day and then have a day off from making music sometimes one of us would be on the camper and wed have to say look outside because youd forget youd be in this bubble making tunes and youd be in the pyrenees mountains all the tracks have got different backgrounds to them different moments happening its been a bit of a jigsaw puzzle because there was no way you could use the first track we recorded as the first track on the album that ended up as being the track pretty dark we shot a lot of dvd footage on the trip as well all the tracks have got different stories behind them the vibe of the journey is picked up on the album
3200230 yeah i think if anything its a bit more like carboot soul and smokers delight because they incorporated that live element the only thing i decided was that i was gonna try to do this album with a more basic approach it was purely bouncing off peoples tunes the different inspirations its way more organic in that way so therefore it feels more live than the previous two albums i think it does have more of a band feel
3200231 two years ago was when i moved and at the time i was exhausted i wasnt interested in piecing together the album straight away i thought i should do it the next summer and at the time i was doing these beach parties over here and having lots of my crew over people from my label over it became almost impossible to make any music you see everyone else lounging by the pool and youre in the studio it doesnt work i realised that the winter is the time to go really deep on it last winter is when i did that it goes from being two million people in the summer to 20 000 people i cant say its completely dead its more alive if anything its just different i found myself going in and making these tracks and realising that i wasnt pooling on the resources that i would with my previous albums which would be going to hang around in my local neighbourhood hanging around at friends houses now were living in paradise in the middle of the country its just different you realise that your environment is also internal when you go there you realise theres another world in there theres a bit of two ing and fro ing with me because i started to get a bit self conscious about the fact that the road trip has gone and happened now i thought maybe i should have finished it straight away when i dropped that issue and i got on with it remembering the road trip i was like wow its come back round the ibiza influence is definitely there because in the winter youve got so much clarity when it comes to tapping into things musically its different its been better for me on a creative level in the city i did things and slept on em did things and slept on em but i wouldnt say that either one is better than the other
3200232 we just dropped a wax on compilation album which i put together and the gelka album is dropping just before my one ive got them coming out to play the n o w launch party at the ibiza rocks hotel on the 20th august the label is taking massive steps to be honest with you i think that doing the label with this new generation of kids coming through has really inspired me on a doing level its helped me get my album done
3200233 weve been doing wax da beach since last year at kumharas but with all the law changes theyve been coming down heavy on a lot of people the people who are more laidback and have more of a hippy nature kumharas is closed until 9th september but when it opens were gonna throw a load of big parties there throughout the month theres a possibility that we might be doing something in formentera as well but the main focus for me is working on the label and getting the next load of acts coming through weve got a negghead album coming too
3200234 the only club ive been to recently is when i went to manumission at amnesia i did a bit of sound design for a performance that they have there and i actually went there to get check out the performance i hadnt been to amnesia for 15 years it was quite an experience i really really enjoyed it the venue is fantastic ive not been dipping my head into the club scene this summer but i will be venturing out as the months pass my favourite months here are august and september

3200356 we regularly have the flags cleaned when they are worn they are burned in a special ceremony
3200357 we always have two sets on hand an 8 by 12 foot u s flag costs 176 99 and we buy them from air a zona flag company who also cleans and repairs them
3200358 normally i dont get involved in the day to day raising of the flag this particular time however i and two others raised the flag took pictures lowered the flag folded it returned the flag to the family
3200359 it was an honor to be part of a flag raising ceremony that held such meaning for this family and do a little something special for one of our american veterans this was a small gesture but one greatly appreciated by the family
3200360 always respected the flag and what is stands for and had a general understanding of flag protocol
3200361 it was a very windy day and i was assisting a sergeant when it came time to lower the u s flag i was bound and determined not to let it touch the ground
3200362 as the flag slowly lowered i grabbed one end and tried to roll it up into my chest with one hand while grabbing the other end with my free hand
3200363 as i was doing this i created a kind of a parachute when the wind caught the flag back then i only weighed about 160 pounds and my feet began to drag over the gravel i thought i was going to take flight for a second i did not take flight but it was a struggle to get the flag into the car
3200364 a lowered u s flag also prompts me to reflect on september 11
3200365 depending on if its for the death of a cop or soldier i get a little bit of sadness when putting the flags at half staff

3200822 what this says to me is that many more than 1 in 4 000 people have mitochondrial disease

3200977 set out to create an epic sound combining thunderous riffs technically exceptional guitar work relentless drive and an abundance of melody that they still wield today and the end result
3200978 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
3200979 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
3200980 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
3200981 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
3200982 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics
3200983 lithica has successfully completed recording for their upcoming release invokation of satan within and is currently in the process of final mixing the new album sounds much more cacophonous than the ep featuring all new material with the exception of a re recording of grominsloft albums are currently being pre sold with an official release date yet to be set expect to see it sometime in october sadly this time also marks another line up change for lithica guitarist vocalist belhor has called it quits with the band in an effort to pursue his solo projects

3200993 if todays athletes say they want to take the risk they really dont know what risk they are taking
3200994 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
3200995 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
3200996 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
3200997 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all

3201003 spector has a long history of resorting to gun related violence to exert his will when he does not get his way
3201004 im gonna go get my gun and blow you away
3201005 successfully poisoned the latest bind popular open source dns software with fully randomised ports
3201006 if you have a gige lan any trojaned machine can poison your dns during one night
3201007 get better at fixing infrastructure we got lucky with this bug the next one will not be so smooth a lot of people just do not realise the degree to which security best practices have been ignored for years dns should not have been capable of this much damage
3201008 even with dns fixed there are other scenarios in which unencrypted ip traffic is lost to an attacker that attacker is capable of way more than he should be more than ive even said here
3201009 get deeper into some of the other characters that only have very small stories generally
3201010 the current debate on how to balance freedom of expression with the need to protect canadians from hate messages in the internet age is an important one we are confident that this review will provide insight into the issues and move the discourse one step further
3201011 legislation must evolve when necessary to respond and reflect changes in society
3201012 as a lawyer and as a parent i think its state interference where the court shouldnt be interfering
3201013 ive got six kids i certainly wouldnt want a judge watching over everything that i do and i wouldnt want my kids being able to run to the judge
3201014 i think it will be revenue neutral but there will be no individual or company in the country that will exactly get back what it pays back in carbon tax
3201015 there will be a lot of winners and a lot of losers

3201030 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3201031 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3201032 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3201033 the whole theory of consolidation is to create a broad portfolio so that it doesnt come to a grinding halt
3201034 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3201035 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3201036 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3201053 the euro and the aussie are at the center of investor attention

3201055 its hard for rookie receivers to make a dominant impact but ill show them in the long run that they made the best decision
3201056 hes got to learn nfl corners its a lot different than college
3201057 he was just big and got away with his athleticism and his size in college it isnt that easy in this league because defensive backs figure it out theyre going to know your weaknesses and try to expose them
3201058 i just went out and talked straight from my heart and told the truth
3201059 there was nothing i was worried to talk about every man has been in situations and its how you handle it only god can judge you and the only ones who now what really went on is me and him
3201060 no one raised me because no one could take care of me now im happy to be here and not go back to that lifestyle
3201061 i came out of high school for basketball but i signed for football just to try it out
3201062 i had a 120 basketball scholarships and three for football i know the number because me and my cousin counted all the letters they sent
3201063 by the time i got over there after participating in both sports things werent happening the way they said it would happen
3201064 ive only played football five years and most of these guys have been doing it since they were six or seven years old
3201065 i feel my potential is huge and i know as far as the red zone goes thats going to be taken care of
3201066 its an exploration to see if our fans and our future fans want us in that stadium
3201067 it needs to grow bmo field has only 20 000 seats so thats a project in itself but first things first lets make sure our fans want to move before we even talk about moving
3201068 its a soccer specific stadium thats how it was built and thats what it was intended for
3201069 the soccer experience is whats paramount there and cant be hampered by anything the seats have to stay where they are when it comes to soccer with seats close to the field and there cant be any other lines on the field football brings with it a whole other set of lines
3201070 thats a great question that would need to be answered in short order
3201071 how serious the argos are we dont know if theyre surveying their season ticket holders that would suggest theyre pretty serious but there are certain things about the stadium that are pretty important to maintain
3201072 candidly we like being in a soccer specific stadium and would worry about any changes that would affect the soccerness the intimacy and the sightlines
3201073 but to speculate what our position would be is premature
3201074 basically mlse needs to co operate because the city gave them a lot of power over that stadium even though government paid for most of it
3201075 their power could determine if we go there if its not a great financial situation it doesnt matter how great the atmosphere is maybe the mayor will step in and make some things happen
3201076 that purport to absolve him of his responsibility to pay child support
3201077 it was shocking to me when his lawyer showed up with arguments that he shouldnt have to pay child support because he was a sperm donor it seemed quite preposterous
3201078 such and such will be remembered like thus and so

3201087 saya telah melaporkan penggunaan ijazah palsu oleh atut penerbitan ijazah palsu oleh universitas borobudur dan pelanggaran pidana oleh seorang oknum polisi yang juga lulusan universitas borobudur
3201088 kapolda sebagai pimpinan tertinggi seyogyanya mengetahui adanya kasus ini berdasarkan laporan anak buahnya tetapi malah anak buahnya ditekan untuk tidak melanjutkan kasus ini
3201089 memang benar kasus ini pernah diperiksa hingga ke penyidikan namun sebagai rakyat saya merasa kasus ini tidak ditindak lanjuti
3201090 saya baru saja didatangi orang intel mabes polri yang menyuruh berhenti dari kasus ini lho kok bisa ya memang siapa dia menyuruh saya untuk berhenti menegakkan keadilan
3201091 kan aneh masa subyek yang sama yaitu ijazah palsu dilaporkan oleh dua orang
3201092 saya melaporkan atut lebih dulu lalu mengapa sekarang laporan pencemaran nama baik terhadap saya juga ditindaklanjuti
3201093 itu kalau memang laporan atut bisa berlanjut tapi secara doktrin hukum jelas tidak akan berlanjut

3201103 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3201104 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3201105 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3201106 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3201107 the uighurs are driving cars and motorcycles they have shops but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3201108 weve got work to do theres no question about that
3201109 the things that break are much better than theyve ever been
3201110 in the meantime the rest of the organization is focused on improving the things that are customer dissatisfiers or again perceived quality
3201111 if i could answer that question you wouldnt be asking it
3201112 over the years we were fairly notorious for im the leader
3201113 theres a lot of room for improvement and theres no reason to doubt that they wouldnt be able to make that up
3201114 weve got a plan it works were gonna stick to it and its constantly being reinforced
3201115 we know the right formula sticking to it and just constantly pushing it every day of the week challenging people to do better thats how were going to get this thing done once and for all
3201116 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3201117 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3201118 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3201119 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3201120 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3201121 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3201122 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3201123 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3201124 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3201125 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3201126 a few of these guys is going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3201127 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3201128 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3201129 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3201130 its non displaced which is good news as were looking at it now we dont think it will be too long after that two week period
3201131 whether its three weeks or a little bit sooner than that or a little bit later im not sure
3201132 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3201133 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3201134 for the last forty years our thought has been trapped in hollow structures of language a stale dead but immensely successful rhetoric this has represented in my view a defeat of the intelligence and of the will
3201135 how difficult it is to be palestinian and how difficult it is for a palestinian to be a writer or a poet how can he achieve literary freedom in such slavish conditions and how can he preserve the literariness of literature in such brutal times

3201139 the solution is simple let the tamils put down their minimum demands clearly and let the sinhalese decide the maximum they are prepared to go along with then let the two sides sit down and hammer out the differences until a consensus is reached
3201140 this is the way the battle will end not with a bang but a whimper
3201141 every time you add you take a little step back and thats kind of what we did today receiver wise anyway
3201142 i thought the offensive line and defensive lines looked pretty good
3201143 i really like our corners bryan mccann and derrius bell
3201144 derrius looked like he rolled his ankle a bit but i think hell be ok
3201145 i think sometime in august i hope to come to conclusion on what im going to do if im going to play or not this year
3201146 i never had a deadline i know there was talk about the first of august but i never said i said sometime in august hopefully ill be able to make a decision
3201147 i wont make that until i really feel comfortable with making a good decision
3201148 im just trying to bring my mind to a point where i can make a good decision whether or not im going to play hockey right now
3201149 as amp e offered the best imaging quality he had seen
3201150 in comparison to the technology currently used by this government agency the backscatter capability provides a much clearer image of low density objects that may be hidden in car fenders tires trucks gas tanks and under the hood
3201151 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3201152 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3201153 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3201154 we have never been and will never be a passive observer in the region
3201155 they are standing at the bridges across from gori they have stopped there

3201193 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
3201194 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information

3201198 for a time it seemed like it was a slam dunk if you were gay from mexico and filed for asylum in the united states
3201199 but theres been a turning point the gay rights movement has started to make progress in mexico and its a little harder to show
3201200 people think the homophobia is under control which is not true
3201201 if the taser was indeed the cause of death this could be an interesting case
3201202 given the historical corruption of law enforcement in the area and the fact that the young man was tased nine times something is definitely wrong with this picture
3201203 we didnt get this negative reaction when nightsticks were used to split heads open but because of the technology and what it does the media have really exacerbated the issue of the taser
3201204 the upside of the taser far outweighs the unfortunate abuse or downside
3201205 were seeing injuries that wouldnt normally happen on a routine traffic stop and all of a sudden theyre happening
3201206 the taser in many cases is going to be safe but its those other cases which actually are prevalent in the population that police interact with that we have a lot of concerns about
3201207 although exposure is not risk free there is no conclusive medical evidence within the state of current medical research that indicates a high risk of serious injury or death from the direct effects of ced conducted energy device exposure
3201208 police sometimes do things theyre not supposed to do and if you put the temptation in front of them if you tell 100 police officers that heres your tasers and youre not supposed to use them to punish someone is going to use them to punish its predictable
3201209 its significant in the sense it shows how this young officer exceeded his authority and use of force and it shows how dangerous those tasers are the community wont rest until they see appropriate relief in regards to this situation

3201224 in a blue 3d font appear underneath the logo the peacock then shines
3201225 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3201226 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3201227 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3201228 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3201229 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3201230 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3201231 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3201232 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3201233 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3201234 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3201235 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3201236 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3201237 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3201238 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3201239 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3201240 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3201241 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3201242 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3201243 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3201244 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3201245 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3201246 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3201247 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3201248 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3201249 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3201250 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3201251 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3201252 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3201253 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3201254 who are open to doing something on the production side
3201255 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3201256 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3201257 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3201258 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3201259 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3201260 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3201261 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3201262 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3201263 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3201264 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3201265 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3201266 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3201267 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3201268 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3201269 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3201270 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3201271 get the fucking pickle outta your ass its a pug kara we dont run kara anymore it doesnt fucking matter
3201272 dont be so immature killstar insulting a guildy is childish youre such a child
3201273 consumer oriented health content it is designed to support patients information needs and foster an overall understanding of health related topics
3201274 this report highlights what can go wrong on holiday it is a reminder to all that taking out comprehensive travel insurance is a crucial part of your holiday planning and not something that should be sacrificed in order to save a few pounds
3201275 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3201276 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3201277 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3201278 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3201279 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3201280 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3201281 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3201282 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3201283 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3201284 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3201285 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3201286 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3201287 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3201288 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3201289 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3201290 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3201291 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3201292 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3201293 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3201294 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3201295 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3201296 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3201297 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3201298 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3201299 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3201300 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3201301 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3201302 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3201303 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3201304 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3201305 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3201306 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3201307 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3201308 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3201309 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3201311 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3201312 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3201340 the average household spends about 25 percent of its home energy costs on heating water
3201341 this training and certification program enables local companies to provide homeowners installation services for a proven solar water heating system with a ten year track record of dependable performance to help lower their energy bill
3201342 solar water heating represents an opportunity for individual homeowners to support the green movement in our country while realizing benefits immediately and for years to come

3201346 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
3201347 solar electricity is expensive to purchase and install it has a long pay back period it converts sunlight to usable energy fairly inefficiently and because of that you need quite a lot of roof space or land to put up enough panels to power your home
3201348 i prefer solar thermal specifically solar hot water a much older technology it is much cheaper to install much more efficient and has a much faster pay back
3201349 if you install a solar water heater your water heating bills should drop 50 to 80 percent not an insignificant sum when you consider that the department of energy says that water heating can account for 14 25 of the energy consumed in our homes

3201371 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3201372 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
3201373 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3201374 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3201375 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3201376 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3201377 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3201378 one thing that i thought was most positive was that we were very physical
3201379 i thought in the first half we went toe to toe with those guys
3201380 we are going to kill ourselves when we get in first and 15 or third and long situations
3201381 the other thing we are going to work on is we had three turnovers on the plus side of the 50 and we only came away with 10 points a field goal and touchdown that is when you have the advantage and you could convert those situations into points
3201382 the way they disguise plays in the nfl with the motions and everything you still match up and play football

3201387 i remember him from 1994 when the chargers were in the super bowl i was 11 and just going into middle
3201388 to make the decisions that weve made about him to insert him as our no 1 was a big step for us and for him weve put a lot of faith in him
3201389 new bills offensive coordinator turk schonert plans to use more spread formations and let trent edwards audible at the line of scrimmage the bills wanted to do these things last year but edwards was a rookie
3201390 there is no orientation and its a bigger learning curve

3201392 the team dynamics are so different than in high school or college
3201393 your teammates all have kids and wives and if you play well you could take their spot
3201394 i respect those older guys its easy to figure out why they are where they are
3201395 when youre in sports youve got to find a way to manage the media there are reporters there every week its part of the territory a lot of professional athletes look at it that way
3201396 i was in a cab in las vegas and the driver asked me what i did for a living
3201397 i said i play football he looked at me in the rear view mirror and he recognized me it turns out he was a big fan of the bills
3201398 buffalo has a small town feel just like los gatos
3201399 but people follow football much more you go to a restaurant go to the mall people know who you are thats another adjustment you always have to put your best foot forward
3201400 youve just got to handle it the right way put yourself in that persons shoes
3201401 i feel like im still just trent around here when im in los gatos or at stanford
3201402 he was in the gym for one of shelbys volleyball games running around with all the other kids
3201403 then i see him throw a ball the length of the gym
3201404 the summer before my freshman year coach scott downs came by my house he had been my t ball coach
3201405 i played volleyball as a freshman and at the end of the year cattolico wanted me to train for football
3201406 i was barely 170 pounds and maybe 6 feet and every guy on that team was huge the only guy i could lift with was cattolico it was kind of embarrassing
3201407 in my sophomore year i worked in there and we went 11 1 and lost in the central coast section semifinals
3201408 i guess he saw something in me i didnt notice it i was just playing and having fun
3201409 i told the seniors that year heres a guy youve got to take care of
3201410 i remember a night when we were over scouting wilcox and in walk our football players eight of em and then here comes little trent
3201411 we walked back into the locker room and wrote remember mitty on the board we didnt lose another football game for three years
3201412 wed been practicing this play all week long to run against wilcox
3201413 it wasnt open and there was a heavy rush but he finally got the ball away
3201414 we hadnt thrown deep all season it was early in the fourth quarter and he had called another play it was one of the only times i ever said anything he stared at me for a long time and i knew if i didnt complete this pass i was never going to call another play
3201415 i came back to the sidelines and he made some comment like nice throw
3201416 we were playing leigh in my junior year and coach lives in the leigh school district the main point of his talk before that game was that if we lost he wouldnt be able to get up the next day and go out in his driveway to get his morning newspaper
3201417 it still never hit me that id play college football
3201418 i was invited to junior day at ucla and i didnt even know what a junior day was
3201419 the head coach brought me in they gave me courtside seats at a basketball game and they said they wanted to offer me a scholarship then a couple of weeks later i went to junior day at stanford
3201420 i narrowed it down to three stanford ucla and michigan
3201421 i wish we could have won more games and gone to a bowl game and i wish wed have beaten cal but i have no regrets
3201422 its hard to talk poorly about stanford youre surrounded by so many gifted people whether academically or athletically
3201423 my roommate didnt know who played in the big game he didnt even know where the stadium was
3201424 i finally got him to come to a game but he left at halftime he had to do a problem set
3201425 and then there was the day i was sitting in class we were talking about imperial china and i looked over at the guy next to me hed been on jeopardy the night before
3201426 he is a young player with a defensive mentality and team first approach to the game we are excited to add these qualities to our team in oklahoma city
3201427 unfortunately this city commission does not understand the consequences of working against tbc texas border coalition valley interfaith nature preserves and everyone eleses efforts to stop the border wall construction all of the border cities throughout are united with tbc and are fighting on brownsvilles behalf but our commissioners unwillingness to stand united against the federal government undermines all who oppose the wall
3201428 anything that puts pressure on the government to give entrepreneurs and smaller companies a leg up should be applauded
3201429 politicians want the praise for when the business is going well and then nothing to do with it if it starts to go badly
3201430 yet many believe the government is not even working within the same framework as them
3201431 most of us want government to reduce its involvement cut regulation lower the tax burden and let them drive their own businesses
3201432 boiled down to its essentials the manifesto is saying that entrepreneurs are vital for the future lifeblood of the economy
3201433 we have seen skills developments through the learning and skills council taper relief formerly on capital gains tax and a record number of businesses being started
3201434 the government has not got it 100 per cent right but uk plc has itself created a very stimulating environment in which to do business
3201435 anybody can come up with 15 obvious statements put them in a press release and call it a manifesto
3201436 if she wants to actually help she should do something with substance
3201437 dont ever give up what you want in life the struggle is worth it
3201438 dont ever give up what you want in life the struggle is worth it
3201439 there is something wrong with the mentality and work ethic of most of the british players

3201462 millions of americans are facing tough challenges every day from the economy to the war in iraq to the housing crisis to crippling energy costs
3201463 everywhere you go across this country people are calling for change they know we cant afford four more years of the same old divisive politics that are light on policy specifics and ways to help people and heavy on cynicism and negativity the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need

3201526 in your mind do you believe america is a democracy or dictatorship
3201527 it has put democrats in congress a bit more on the defensive
3201528 it has given them a way to dramatically illustrate the idea they are for drilling and doing something and the democrats are not
3201529 americans have a lot of questions about why this congress is not working

3201797 if it werent for you many of my soldiers would have died
3201798 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3201799 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3201800 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3201801 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3201802 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3201803 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3201804 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3201805 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3201806 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3201807 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3201808 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3201809 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3201810 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3201811 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are

3201816 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3201817 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3201818 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3201819 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3201820 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3201821 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3201822 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3201823 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3201824 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3201825 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3201826 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3201827 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3201828 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3201829 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3201830 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3201831 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3201832 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3201833 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3201834 its starting to show the guy can still play football

3201847 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3201848 he does like to spread the ball around a lot
3201849 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play
3201850 overall there is nothing in the available data to suggest that the introduction of variable fees in england has had any lasting impact on the level or pattern of demand for full time undergraduate education
3201851 a very high degree of stability in the ethnicity of applicants and acceptances the social class mix and the age distribution
3201852 they had us pinned down on the 1 yard line and i was supposed to run a quarterback sneak to the a gap
3201853 i remember him from 1994 when the chargers were in the super bowl i was 11 and just going into middle
3201854 to make the decisions that weve made about him to insert him as our no 1 was a big step for us and for him weve put a lot of faith in him
3201855 new bills offensive coordinator turk schonert plans to use more spread formations and let trent edwards audible at the line of scrimmage the bills wanted to do these things last year but edwards was a rookie
3201856 there is no orientation and its a bigger learning curve
3201857 if you dont perform if the gm doesnt think highly of you you can be out of a job
3201858 the team dynamics are so different than in high school or college
3201859 your teammates all have kids and wives and if you play well you could take their spot
3201860 i respect those older guys its easy to figure out why they are where they are
3201861 when youre in sports youve got to find a way to manage the media there are reporters there every week its part of the territory a lot of professional athletes look at it that way
3201862 i was in a cab in las vegas and the driver asked me what i did for a living
3201863 i said i play football he looked at me in the rear view mirror and he recognized me it turns out he was a big fan of the bills
3201864 buffalo has a small town feel just like los gatos
3201865 but people follow football much more you go to a restaurant go to the mall people know who you are thats another adjustment you always have to put your best foot forward
3201866 youve just got to handle it the right way put yourself in that persons shoes
3201867 i feel like im still just trent around here when im in los gatos or at stanford
3201868 he was in the gym for one of shelbys volleyball games running around with all the other kids
3201869 then i see him throw a ball the length of the gym
3201870 the summer before my freshman year coach scott downs came by my house he had been my t ball coach
3201871 i played volleyball as a freshman and at the end of the year cattolico wanted me to train for football
3201872 i was barely 170 pounds and maybe 6 feet and every guy on that team was huge the only guy i could lift with was cattolico it was kind of embarrassing
3201873 in my sophomore year i worked in there and we went 11 1 and lost in the central coast section semifinals
3201874 i guess he saw something in me i didnt notice it i was just playing and having fun
3201875 i told the seniors that year heres a guy youve got to take care of
3201876 i remember a night when we were over scouting wilcox and in walk our football players eight of em and then here comes little trent
3201877 we walked back into the locker room and wrote remember mitty on the board we didnt lose another football game for three years
3201878 wed been practicing this play all week long to run against wilcox
3201879 it wasnt open and there was a heavy rush but he finally got the ball away
3201880 we hadnt thrown deep all season it was early in the fourth quarter and he had called another play it was one of the only times i ever said anything he stared at me for a long time and i knew if i didnt complete this pass i was never going to call another play
3201881 i came back to the sidelines and he made some comment like nice throw
3201882 we were playing leigh in my junior year and coach lives in the leigh school district the main point of his talk before that game was that if we lost he wouldnt be able to get up the next day and go out in his driveway to get his morning newspaper
3201883 it still never hit me that id play college football
3201884 i was invited to junior day at ucla and i didnt even know what a junior day was
3201885 the head coach brought me in they gave me courtside seats at a basketball game and they said they wanted to offer me a scholarship then a couple of weeks later i went to junior day at stanford
3201886 i narrowed it down to three stanford ucla and michigan
3201887 i wish we could have won more games and gone to a bowl game and i wish wed have beaten cal but i have no regrets
3201888 its hard to talk poorly about stanford youre surrounded by so many gifted people whether academically or athletically
3201889 my roommate didnt know who played in the big game he didnt even know where the stadium was
3201890 i finally got him to come to a game but he left at halftime he had to do a problem set
3201891 and then there was the day i was sitting in class we were talking about imperial china and i looked over at the guy next to me hed been on jeopardy the night before
3201892 the size of the award made by the court today reflects his talent and potential prior to the tackle as one of the brightest young footballers in the country
3201893 having said that ben would understandably have preferred to earn this sum through a full career as a professional footballer
3201894 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to hard work and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3201895 during his 11 years at manchester united he had impressed players and staff at all levels from sir alex ferguson and gary neville to the contemporaries who played alongside him
3201896 the tackle was high and over the ball and as a consequence the claimant suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula of his right leg
3201897 his positive attitude towards his injury and to the devastating blow of being unable to pursue his chosen career does him great credit
3201898 he was plainly intelligent and it is clear that he has brought and will in the future bring to his academic studies the same dedication and commitment that he formerly applied to football
3201899 the most remarkable student i have had the pleasure to teach
3201900 i think they should hear georgia will never surrender georgia will never surrender
3201901 no matter how superhuman a military you have if you have not been preparing the attack for months and months for gods sake how can you mobilise into another country 1 000 tanks within hours if its not a premeditated attack on a neighbouring country
3201902 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3201903 we will go to the end because we once lost our freedom to russia
3201904 i think they should hear georgia will never surrender georgia will never surrender
3201905 at this stage weve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating that theyre needing to seek protection in australia
3201906 any large event in australia is going to absolutely have in amongst the people who come here those who are seeking protection
3201907 its a very clear and known means for people to flee persecution in their country of origin
3201908 obviously were aware that there are pilgrims out there who have been given three month visas and so it might well be at the end of those three months we see a spike in applications for protection
3201909 at this stage we amp squo ve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating that they amp squo re needing to seek protection in australia
3201910 any large event in australia is going to absolutely have in amongst the people who come here those who are seeking protection

3201915 we had two practices today and i felt like the morning practice went well
3201916 the afternoon was very productive the team is getting better both sides of the ball made progress today as well as our special teams
3201917 its not serious and it does not require surgery its a rest thing it is not a severe anything so we feel like we will have him back in short order we dont really know what length of time short order is
3201918 the doctors keep upgrading it there is little swelling its really precautionary
3201919 he was having a great day on saturday i would not suppose that it would hinder him in pursuing the job
3201920 jordan is getting a lot more snaps because jarrett is watching
3201921 he is competing he made a nice scramble in this practice that we just had for about 30 yards and a score it was a nice play
3201922 what we are doing is working on get off time and working on getting the ball out of the punters hands it probably affected how they punted this morning both guys josh jasper and brady dalfrey are really in the thick of it both guys are competing well and i wouldnt be surprised if both didnt punt at times
3201923 brett and charles have missed pieces of the two a days
3201924 i think they will be back in a couple days i dont know how long for helms but i know he is chomping at the bit one thing we want to do especially when we have time is to get him healthy both helms and alexander could play if we were playing a game today
3201925 we are in the process of the invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country

3201932 femas damage assessment found that communities suffered major and costly damage
3201933 im pleased that president bush has moved to issue this disaster declaration to provide financial assistance to communities
3201934 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
3201935 the state of new hampshire will continue to work closely with local communities and volunteer organization to help ensure our citizens who were impacted by the storm get the assistance they need
3201936 recent storms have caused significant damage in many communities across new hampshire which is why we are asking fema to begin assessments to determine eligibility for federal assistance
3201937 the move aims to better govern the military according to the law and maintain a good image of the air force with strict measures

3201944 craig is as down to earth as anybody ive ever met
3201945 the greatest thing i can say about craig leipold is hes got 100 best friends hes so busy hes got five kids a wonderful successful wife tons of business ventures yet hes there for so many people a hundred people call craig leipold their best friend
3201946 we all know not to cross the line when were in the box he lives and dies by every minute of the game you cant sit in the two seats on each side of him and you definitely cant at all talk to him
3201947 i take the stat sheet its the perfect size and i roll it up and its always in my hand so i have something to pound
3201948 a few times i may have accidentally hit the tv with the paper
3201949 i remember the suite managers used to come in look at the tv and say oh no somebody from above must have thrown something and hit the tv again
3201950 he was very respectful and understanding of the so called pecking order
3201951 he never once went to barry to talk to him about the hockey team he always went through me and allowed the people put in charge to make decisions make decisions
3201952 the contribution that i want to provide the team is more in the marketing and sales and strategic planning and budgeting
3201953 risebroughs area is to make hockey decisions and i dont want to get in their way
3201954 doug understands clearly these are his decisions my job is to budget and his job is to spend up to that budget frankly were talking about the 56 7 million salary cap here this is his job this is what hes paid to do
3201955 i have never given him an idea because it doesnt matter
3201956 it might as well be joe blow on the street dougs mind set is as gm and president mine is as fan and owner the person i want making decisions on the players is a guy who thinks like a gm not like an owner or fan
3201957 not just hockey if he plays golf with you he wants to win if youre out to dinner its all about the best wine or best cigars
3201958 for years craig convinced me he played an integral part in that game
3201959 it wasnt until i pushed him years later that i learned he was actually the 15th man and saw weavers shot from the bench
3201960 the second i saw her legs i said thats it
3201961 ive talked to him about this for almost 20 years and to be able to see a guy who had a vision and passion and then watch him intelligently and systematically go after it and bring his dream to fruition its extraordinary
3201962 craig calls me and says can you call then university of wisconsin hockey coach jeff sauer and get me the rules of hockey like what offsides is im about to spend 80 million to buy a pro franchise

3202149 there are significant vulnerabilities in the current motor vehicle and driver systems many missourians may be unaware that current law allows out of state companies to cheaply buy their personal motor vehicle records and then sell this information to make a quick buck raising the price for access to personal information would make it substantially more difficult for these businesses to buy and resell missourians personal information

3202157 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to hard work and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3202158 during his 11 years at manchester united he had impressed players and staff at all levels from sir alex ferguson and gary neville to the contemporaries who played alongside him
3202159 the tackle was high and over the ball and as a consequence the claimant suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula of his right leg
3202160 his positive attitude towards his injury and to the devastating blow of being unable to pursue his chosen career does him great credit

3202174 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind

3202188 aimed at creating an indigenous capability to make this equipment and reduce its dependence on smuggling
3202189 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
3202190 the sam threat to natos aircrews was far more pronounced and harrowing than media coverage typically depicted
3202191 that legacy is in danger of being swept under the carpet
3202192 whether thaksin really changed thailand or not we will have to wait and see in the coming months
3202193 the theory that all thailands political problems occurred because of thaksin will soon be proved wrong
3202194 the real problem of the divide between political parties and the elite hasnt gone way
3202195 if thaksin is ousted from the country his colleagues may split into many parts and many groups said porranee tongyen head of research at asia plus securities pcl
3202196 thaksin showed that he is guilty by choosing not to fight in court parnthep pongpourpan a protest organiser told the foreign media
3202197 we will support the justice system by keeping up the pressure against the government and parliament
3202198 we do not comment on individual cases tom hoskin british prime minister gordon browns spokesman told reporters in london on monday

3202202 49 believe most reporters are trying to help barack obama win the election this year revealed that many americans think that the us media are biased
3202203 without question sen obama is a dynamic candidate and articulate speaker he can move a crowd but does this justify the media establishments infatuation with him the medias courtship of obama is indicated by how much time they recently spent covering his campaign
3202204 daniel schorr of national public radio justified the unequal coverage this past weekend by saying that obama is making news and mccain is not whatever the rationale the press establishment must realize that such imbalance in coverage amounts to free advertising for the democratic nominee
3202205 the coming weeks and months will form part of an eventful season for accies

3202216 calling a ruler son of god is out of style no one really does that nowadays we can support a president while also worshipping jesus as the son of god
3202217 jesus is the answer but not in the real world
3202218 i think the political platform jesus laid out in his sermon on the mount plain are great ideas but unrealistic therefore im going for what i believe to be the next best thing and endorsing because his her vision is a little more tangible a little more reality based
3202219 who says that im voting does it matter who i vote for what i think does matter are the politics of jesus are we truly loving others as we should love ourselves are the naked being clothed are the sick being cared for are the prisoners being visited are the hungry and thirsty being fed and quenched of their thirst are the strangers being welcomed

3202236 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
3202237 naturally were interested in those two that made it through our treatment process at really really small levels

3202239 you have no idea how we sat up at night

3202241 we expect to have all positions filled but we wont have a surplus
3202242 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
3202243 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3202244 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
3202245 your just mad that you cant get your pants this tight cause your too fat

3202262 even at the opening ceremony we were the only athletes not sweating because our traditional malay costumes were made in silk
3202263 it was a make or break race for me but it had a steep climb which didnt suit me
3202264 i was really quite devastated and frustrated not to be able to go to beijing but my bitterness is slowly dissolving

3202272 sin messi en el campo y con la camiseta del barcelona el wisla tendr m s opciones por conseguir un buen resultado para la vuelta sabemos que ellos saldr n con ganas y con la intenci n de sentenciar pero no lo tendr n sencillo
3202273 if you push these guys through this then they can last a long time
3202274 so were going to back off weve got plenty of guys to get the reps
3202275 this is not the amnesty that i asked for my amnesty draft was aimed at saving the inmates from their fate
3202276 immediate medical treatment has become obligatory considering that the decision making and metabolisms of these people have completely deteriorated
3202277 if the current bans on broadcasting in a mother tongue are lifted broadcasting will be done not only in kurdish but also in several other languages and this is something beneficial
3202278 cultural diversity has not caused any damage either in france or in britain and spain all unitary states there is no other alternative within the eu
3202279 the issue of broadcasting in kurdish clearly reveals the chaos ruling within the state mechanism
3202280 as for the heart of the issue there have been two approaches we can observe in the issue of kurdish tv and radio broadcasting
3202281 those preoccupied with a danger of pkks becoming a political entity should ask themselves this question is it not the case that pkks politicization already exists
3202282 risks are always associated with a move to differ from established policies but one should not be hesitant if the risk of insisting on these policies is bigger
3202283 it is as though we will solve all of our problems if we elect rather than appoint rectors
3202284 in a changing world universities have assumed greater significance administrative models at universities should change and we need rectors who will show initiative
3202285 the demands of death fasters should be met we will continue to demonstrate our support until these demands are met
3202286 the implementations of the regime that followed it are fresh in our memory
3202287 it must be known that those who want to send us to the streets are agents if such people are found in our organization they will be expelled
3202288 turkeys direction creates the impression that some people hope to benefit from an intervening regime
3202289 the intervening regimes cause a loss of esteem in the world and it is also considered that they cannot create a solution to problems and that is why their architects work on these factors
3202290 do you agree with the prime ministers concern that a button was pushed
3202291 i believe that the respected prime minister referred to secret organizations it is true that the people who may benefit from amnesty and the heads of the organizations are not on the death fast but their sympathizers are which points to the fact that events have been organized there are meetings at universities in support of the death fasts it is certain that some people gave the green light
3202292 while it was believed prior to the coup detat of sept 12 that left or right wing organizations had given the go ahead a different player was subsequently revealed
3202293 the amnesty chaos has led to unhappiness the death fasts continue the fasters have called upon the so called intellectuals the government lent support
3202294 the goal is to prevent the loss of organization members strength by their transferral to f type prisons which may damage their opportunities and solidarity
3202295 there have been provocations by secret organizations recently to forestall the developments in human rights and democracy
3202296 we deem it a duty to warn citizens against provocative acts which are based on the same causes as in the past but appear through different motifs and in different contexts
3202297 our country and citizens have been harmed by terrorism the tendencies which are far removed from the problems of our citizens who suffer from unemployment and inflation and which abuse the enthusiasm and boldness of our youth have been penetrated most strongly by secret organizations
3202298 the latest incident which resulted in the death of two security officers is just such a provocation it is very grave that organized groups of police officers should have violated security regulations all over the country especially when we remember their duty of establishing security
3202299 we invite our citizens progressive intellectuals and institutions to be vigilant against the provocations geared to obstructing democratic developments and we call on them to join forces
3202300 turkeys prime minister says the economic crises is over nothing is over we should ensure the privatization of turkish post telegraph and telephone ptt turkish airlines thy and all the state economic enterprises kits
3202301 these are new losses the total budget deficit that will be announced in 2001 is tl 35 quadrillion and the prime minister believes that the economic problems can be solved these banks cannot be saved they should be eliminated
3202302 it was a big robbery and everybody knows about it yet it was covered up the bill will be footed by industrialists the business sector and citizens it is not over yet new banks are coming
3202303 if we continue with this imf program despite its dangers we should make revisions immediately this years situation is worse than last years
3202304 internal affairs cannot be left to the eu prisons cannot be left to the prisoners if this happens everyone will start to march and demonstrate because the public lost their patience an experienced political power should govern turkey

3202323 by working with johnson controls oak ridge national laboratory will achieve its long term energy reduction goals far earlier than expected while saving millions of taxpayer dollars
3202324 we are dedicated to alternative energy sources being able to tap renewable energy for our facility is a great way to see our purpose realized
3202325 one year ago secretary bodman challenged the entire u s department of energy to meet or exceed the presidents goals for increasing energy efficiency decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy in the federal government
3202326 im proud to announce doe is delivering with alternative financing methods that reduce the need for federal spending

3202331 tener una buena relaci n con el farmac utico y quedar de vez en cuando con l para que te ense e las recetas as puedo saber si el m dico al que le pagu un viaje me hizo caso y prescribi mi f rmaco si no es as puedo apretarle m s o no en funci n de lo que me interese
3202332 por ejemplo yo puedo dar dinero a una agencia de viajes para que facture el viaje como un congreso y que al final el m dico elija el destino que quiera as constar a como que le he financiado el congreso que est dentro de lo legal
3202333 pero por lo que escucho decir a mis antiguos compa eros todav a se siguen ejerciendo algunas de estas pr cticas eso s de forma m s solapada como invitar a la pareja del m dico al viaje establecido para el congreso
3202334 hay gente que ni siquiera te recibe otros son encantadores pero serios y luego est n
3202335 las verdades tienen muchas maneras de verse pero mi trabajo es quitar ese sesgo
3202336 si yo ganara lo que gana un m dico en estados unidos no tendr a que pedir que me pagaran el precio del congreso es un mecanismo aceptado en espa a otra cosa es que haya gente que recete el medicamento de su amigo o que en cambio prescriba lo que aconseja la sociedad cient fica correspondiente
3202337 empresas de investigaci n de mercado ven an a evaluar determinadas campa as publicitarias nos presentaban varias im genes o esl ganes para ver cu l record bamos mejor cu l nos gustaba m s pero
3202338 da la sensaci n de que buscan los resultados de un ensayo ideal a partir de los cuales el especialista aceptar a prescribir un determinado medicamento y no otro
3202339 cuando yo trabajaba se hablaba de las ventas colocadas era el cl sico tres por dos es decir si me compras esta cantidad de este producto te regalo una parte el dinero extra se lo queda la farmacia elegimos aquellas m s cercanas a los centros de salud o las que m s venden
3202340 yo he visto c mo el farmac utico te da un medicamento distinto al que pone en la receta y no se trataba de un gen rico
3202341 hay compa as que realizan encuestas a los profesionales de los centros de salud para saber el tipo de pacientes que has tratado qu cantidad de producto recetas etc estos datos se los venden a las farmac uticas y a cambio de tu colaboraci n te dan un regalo
3202342 me sorprende que tengan esa informaci n que debe ser confidencial adem s esto implica un riesgo porque la industria farmac utica dise a estrategias individualizadas
3202343 en muchas farmac uticas les forman para que aprendan a realizar fichas de los m dicos sobre sus gustos
3202344 hay una parte que s lo son pero muchos creen que controlan m s de lo que lo hacen

3202357 discussions about how to manage aids in the long term and how to improve prevention efforts globally took center stage at this years international aids conference iac held in mexico city unlike previous iac conferences this years event did not have a plenary session focused on vaccines but that did not stop luminaries and vaccine advocates alike from calling for continued support for an aids vaccine to end the epidemic
3202358 some long term survivors of hiv infection produce rare and extremely potent antibodies that keep the disease from progressing to aids and might point to a way to protect uninfected people from the virus researchers reported yesterday in the closing hours of the 17th international aids conference in mexico city
3202359 developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail
3202360 hiv vaccine development has been frustrating and challenging for a number of reasons including the fact that the virus mutates rapidly hides from the immune system and targets and destroys the immune system cells that are successful in fighting and clearing most other viruses from the body with hiv we will have to do better than nature if we are to develop a vaccine hiv is unlike the situation with other viral diseases such as measles and influenza where we have been able to mimic natural infection and induce protective responses with vaccines my institute and many other organizations around the world are working on this problem and advances are being made
3202361 en nada se corresponde con la solidez de las variables econ micas y sociales que rigen en nuestro pa s
3202362 el valor de algunas de las especies de t tulos nacionales se encuentran tan injustificadamente deprimido que el gobierno obtendr a un ahorro de servicios de deuda de casi 25 d lares por cada 100 invertidos s lo tomando en consideraci n vencimientos del corriente ejercicio
3202363 dentro de un men muy grande y con muchas series
3202364 un primer paso en esta estrategia consiste en intervenir en los mercados a los efectos de adelantar servicios de deuda que deber an afrontarse en los pr ximos meses y el a o entrante
3202365 la argentina tiene voluntad y capacidad de pago como lo demostr al amortizar d as atr s 2 345 millones de d lares del boden 2012
3202366 se encuentra pr cticamente cumplido a esta altura del a o
3202367 se sustenta en la oportunidad que ofrece el valor de mercado registrado por los t tulos de deuda nacional en las ltimas jornadas
3202368 el mercado interpret una se al negativa la tasa de inter s pagada por el bono que compr el gobierno de venezuela
3202369 la posibilidad de apelar a esta estrategia no es casual sino causal ya que surge de la robustez que evidencian las cuentas p blicas desde 2003
3202370 el ahorro fiscal acumulado en el ltimo lustro nico per odo de cinco a os consecutivos con excedentes anuales superiores al 3 del pbi en m s de 100 a os es lo que permite al gobierno nacional tomar una medida que redundar en indudables ventajas fiscales
3202371 de esta manera se refuerza la estrategia de ahorro p blico prudencial como una pol tica sistem tica
3202372 uno de los pilares del actual programa de desarrollo sostenido con inclusi n social
3202373 medidas de este tipo constituyen operaciones normales de administraci n de la deuda p blica y manejo profesional de pasivos llevadas a cabo por la tesorer a de diversos pa ses emergentes en los ltimos a os

3202389 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3202390 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3202391 encendi las alarmas en los mercados porque se crey hab a tocado fondo
3202392 los mercados van a reaccionar bien van a corregir parte de esta ca da
3202393 tard amente se entendi que hay una conexi n entre el sistema productivo y el mercado de capitales
3202394 claramente hay una falta ministro de econom a que sea visible al igual que el secretario de hacienda
3202395 se prendi como una luz de alarma en todos lados por la posibilidad de que se registren problemas fiscales y porque baj el petr leo la soja y el trigo todos precios que se relacionan con la recaudaci n
3202396 entre las preguntas que se hacen los inversores est qui n es el ministro de econom a algunos dicen es rodr guez ah no fern ndez directamente no saben el nombre porque carlos fern ndez es muy poco lo que aparece en p blico

3202402 if anyone might approach bart starrs capability it could be aaron rodgers
3202403 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3202404 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3202405 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3202406 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3202407 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3202408 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3202410 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3202411 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3202412 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3202413 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3202414 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3202415 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3202416 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3202417 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3202418 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3202419 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3202420 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3202421 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3202422 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3202423 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3202430 existen unos 8000 manuscritos de la vulgata latina y cuando menos 1000 de las otras versiones primitivas a dase unos 4000 manuscritos griegos y tenemos 1300 copias manuscritas de porciones del nuevo testamento adem s de todo esto gran parte del nuevo testamento puede reproducirse de las citas de los escritores cristianos primitivos
3202431 el manifestarse esc ptico respecto del texto resultante de los libros del nuevo testamento equivale a lanzar a la oscuridad todos los cl sicos de la antig edad pues ning n documento del per odo antiguo est como este tan bien respaldado bibliogr ficamente como el nuevo testamento
3202432 los jud os lo preservaron como ning n otro manuscrito ha sido preservado jam s con su masora parva magna y finalis llevaban la cuenta de cada letra s laba palabra y p rrafo ten an clases especiales de hombres dentro de su cultura cuya exclusiva misi n era preservar y transmitir estos documentos con fidelidad pr cticamente perfecta escribas abogados masoretas qui n cont jam s las letras s labas y palabras de plat n o arist teles de cicer n o de s neca
3202433 en relaci n con el nuevo testamento existen alrededor de trece mil manuscritos completos e incompletos en griego y en otros idiomas que han sobrevivido desde la antig edad ninguna otra obra cl sica de la antig edad cuenta con tal respaldo
3202434 en un art culo en el north american review un escritor hizo algunas comparaciones entre los escritos de shakespeare y las escrituras donde muestra que mucho mayor cuidado debe haberse tenido con los manuscritos b blicos que con otros escritos aun cuando hab a mucha mayor oportunidad de preservar el texto correcto por medio de copias impresas que cuando todas las copias ten an que hacerse a mano
3202435 now listen when i die i want you to take all my money and place it in the casket with me i wanna take my money to the afterlife
3202436 i hope you werent crazy enough to put all that money in the casket
3202437 yes i promised im a good christian i cant lie i promised him that i was going to put that money in that casket with him
3202438 you mean to tell me you put every cent of his money in the casket with him
3202439 boy did you ever hit a sore spot with me
3202440 that simply boggles my mind im not a 12 year old girl going off to scout camp for gods sake
3202441 with the robber smiling straight in my face while doing the robbing

3202444 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3202445 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3202446 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3202447 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3202448 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3202449 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3202450 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3202451 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3202452 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3202453 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3202454 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3202455 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3202456 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3202457 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3202458 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3202459 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3202460 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3202461 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3202462 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3202463 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3202464 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3202465 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3202466 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3202467 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3202468 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3202469 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3202470 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3202471 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3202472 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3202473 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3202474 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3202475 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3202476 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3202477 if i sleep with him hell do more than cum

3202479 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question

3202485 this would be one of our bigger ones in recent history
3202486 our direction to the field is that they have to be deferring enough spending to come up with their share of the 400 million
3202487 this is not a good way to manage public lands
3202488 congress knows it the forest service knows it and it needs to be fixed
3202489 will do everything he can to get the forest service the emergency money it needs to put out these fires so it can get back to managing forests in a way that will reduce fire danger in the future
3202490 there was a lot of shrapnel flying in the air there was pieces of propane tanks coming down out of the sky
3202491 thats what we were running away from when we first left the house
3202492 there was a lot of stuff flying out of the sky on fire
3202493 i think time of day saved us and thats how much worse it could be no one was out of their houses no one was sitting on their front lawns
3202494 the numbers of casualties we could have had would be tremendous

3202498 ive got our kids at my house ive got a dog with no food
3202499 im disappointed with the government that they would allow anything like a propane company to be situated where it is in the middle of a heavy residential area
3202500 this convention marks a milestone in the iaffs history because we are celebrating our 90th year throughout our long history this union has worked hard to improve the safety of fire fighters weve worked hard to improve the standard of living for fire fighters this week we will focus on ensuring that our future is as successful as our past

3202563 a calculated and prudent decision about the future of tasman for 2008
3202564 unless theres another offer forthcoming that doesnt require any other burden to the tasman rugby union and our entities in 2009 then we cant accept the offer
3202565 i dont think were going to be able to reverse their decision unless something comes from left field
3202566 if we dont do that then were giving up the fight and were not representing the interests of everybody who wants to see the tasman rugby union and the makos having a chance to continue
3202567 if we just accept their decision and start thinking about 2009 heartland then were letting a huge number of people down
3202568 theres no doubt that its going to have a major impact on rugby because were going to be playing in a competition that we dont really have any aspirations to want to play in
3202569 our aspirations were always to play in the air new zealand cup that was the whole purpose of the tasman rugby union coming together to give our talent a pathway to the higher level of provincial rugby
3202570 that has now been taken away from us so well find that the talent that we have here now will no doubt disappear because a lot of our players are professional rugby players they will seek employment opportunities elsewhere whether it be in new zealand or overseas
3202571 the gap between heartland and air new zealand cup is so wide that it will become a bit of a joke
3202572 hes obviously recovering from some issues that hes had within the all black environment and hes just managing himself in conjunction with our medical staff
3202573 whether they all blacks management want us to potentially give him an opportunity to play at some point remains to be seen but hes part of our family and these boys are welcome at any time
3202574 if things were so great up there then why are we so screwed up as people down here
3202575 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
3202576 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
3202577 take the chair in front of us and try not to be nervous
3202578 what are all these spirits doing in the room get them out of here
3202579 you do this you do that this reading is over
3202580 reincarnationists do not seem to want to consider the logical explanations for their experiences which are sometimes as little as feeling drawn to a place etc does anyone really consider this their proof of a past life
3202581 if things were so great up there then why are we so screwed up as people down here
3202582 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
3202583 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
3202584 you probably have no idea what you are talking about
3202585 spirits are giving you impressions of their past its not you remembering
3202586 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
3202587 when i reached the spirit world i found such glory and happiness and beauty that i now realize this little earth is a grammar school not a university or even a high school it is only the first lesson of life
3202588 you can learn in one day here what takes years to learn on earth forget reincarnation because it is a sandbag around your neck you will have it so centered on your mind that you will think of nothing else and you will stay just where you are you cannot progress because your mind will always revert to the earth again you cannot live on the earth more than once life is progression not retrogression
3202589 but the survival of personal identity adequately supported by facts contradicts the main doctrine of the reincarnationist
3202590 in your mind do you believe america is a democracy or dictatorship
3202591 it has put democrats in congress a bit more on the defensive
3202592 it has given them a way to dramatically illustrate the idea they are for drilling and doing something and the democrats are not
3202593 americans have a lot of questions about why this congress is not working

3202600 every infrastructure vendor should follow microsofts lead in giving a heads up to discovered vulnerabilities
3202601 there has been way too much finger pointing to be healthy the customer business is vulnerable up and down the stack you dont get full value out of removing an operating system vulnerability if an attack can waltz in through an application and vice versa security professionals have a responsibility to ensure that information is shared to remove as many vulnerabilities as possible
3202602 i think microsoft gets the blame every time there is a vulnerability discovered even if the security hole exists in third party software
3202603 id prefer to think that microsoft is assuming the responsibility that the customers expect from infrastructure vendors
3202604 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3202605 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3202606 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3202607 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3202636 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq
3202637 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
3202638 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
3202639 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
3202640 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
3202641 it is clear that he did record some of our conversations but at no time did he inform me that he was doing so or seek my permission
3202642 i plan to consult counsel about the legality of his action
3202643 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service tahir jalil habbush al tikriti to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
3202644 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
3202645 they secretly resettled habbush in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
3202646 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
3202647 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
3202648 far from being comfortable i told mr suskind that many of the things he wrote about what i did and said were wrong
3202649 statement and my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
3202650 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
3202651 they were in fact on white paper i was asked to respond to documents regarding the potential use of habbush upon his defection and during the difficult fall of 2003 when we were wrestling with a developing iraqi insurgency and ways to combat it i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found many of such queries did originate from the staff of the office of the vice president none of this however substantiates mr suskinds explosive allegation
3202652 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr
3202653 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
3202654 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
3202655 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
3202656 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
3202657 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
3202658 was inappropriately performing intelligence activities of developing producing and disseminating that should be performed by the intelligence community
3202659 mr suskind appears to have conflated two separate conversations one about the problems of reading saddam husseins intentions an issue which is dealt with in the butler report and one about habbush
3202660 i made it clear to mr suskind that i was in no position to comment on the substance or significance of any dealing with the latter since i had not been privy to the detail of what had taken place something mr suskind has chosen not to mention and in any event i had made it clear to mr suskind when first he approached me that i would not divulge classified information to which i had had access during my time in government
3202661 from the very beginning there was a conviction that saddam hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go
3202662 from the very first instance it was about iraq it was about what we can do to change this regime
3202663 estamos muy satisfechos por los resultados que a o tras a o obtenemos contamos con personas muy capacitadas dispuestas a dar lo mejor de s que adem s se han destacado frente al personal de otros pa ses en el gran prix latinoamericano y del caribe
3202664 look what youve offered us is an argument masquerading as a narrative news story im very interested in arguments especially on a policy topic as difficult and fraught with risks as this and i dont doubt that you have important things to say but if you want to offer an argument then well argue it make claims and then explain the evidence for your premises you offer us a narrative story that is lets be honest very moscow centric backed by a couple of unnamed us government sources mr chivers i dont doubt you have important things to say about the russia georgia war so why dont you report the facts unadorned and if you want to argue your opinions then do so in a plainly stated argumentative way
3202665 as a kid i watched the olympics quite a lot
3202666 every time it was on you watched it religiously it was exciting as an athlete i am really proud to represent my country so i know a little bit about how they must feel it has to be pretty cool for all of the athletes from different sports to meet there and bond as americans
3202667 this year i will be watching michael phelps to see what he can do the united states has always had good sprinters so that is something i will pay special attention to as well

3202673 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3202674 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3202675 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3202676 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3202677 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3202678 but i realized im better than that i am out there consciously improving my life and he is holding on to his judgment and negativity i am strong i am happy i am confident
3202679 shes so lucky shes a star but she cry cry cries in her lonely heart thinking if theres nothing missing in my life then why do these tears come at night

3202683 this album is entirely devoted to minimalist solo piano music every musical idea is a snapshot of my lifes journey the constant stream of my emotions and experiences of the past and present when playing the piano i attempt to capture a portion of this incessant current of divine energy and turn it into something special something that can not be expressed through words or consciously perceived through the senses it is a subliminal sensation that touches me from within
3202684 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3202685 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3202686 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3202850 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action

3202852 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3202918 my email program wont let me read any of my emails all i get are little boxes with red xs in them what am i going to do
3202919 these guys were just going out and asking people to come for the bible study
3202920 i didnt even understand his english he was talking to me by signals and i understood the invitation from his signals
3202921 sometimes we dont know the importance when we go out to invite people to come to bible study
3202922 sometimes we think this is wasting time this guy had no idea who i was
3202923 they studied the bible with me and figured out who i was only five months later
3202924 they got to know me and even got to know my father he invited them to our house and they had no idea that he was one of the top leaders of the hamas organization
3202925 i didnt have enough knowledge about christianity i was open minded
3202926 i never had in my mind in that moment that i would go this far to become a believer i had studied history and thought this would be a good chance to study to meet new international people and see what they are saying it was definitely not about christianity
3202927 he was invited to a bible study to me this is profound
3202928 some guy didnt know who joseph was this guy was just a normal christian he wasnt an apologist he wasnt a specialist he was just a normal christian who invited someone to a bible study
3202929 they just shared the love of christ and he went home and read his bible this is such a testimony to all us christians that we need to present everyone with the simple gospel this is a call for everyone to stand out
3202930 when he was exposed to the word of god the holy spirit did a work on him and look what happened
3202931 just to stop and think for a minute about announcing your christianity you feel sick immediately because its crazy
3202932 youre not just saying goodbye to a religion to a tradition
3202933 suddenly you are starting from scratch and canceling everything you have in society
3202934 but when it started i was ready for any circumstances i thought about the worst conditions that could happen as consequences after my announcement but and i tell you this is a miracle this is how god works you carry the cross and rely on him completely and he takes care of everything
3202935 this may be the first case that a well known muslim just goes to the public and says i am a christian
3202936 many muslim sheiks many muslim imams may be converted to christianity but they keep that a secret they didnt announce it because it is very embarrassing for them and for their families they were afraid for their lives
3202937 but i decided to declare jesus in front of the world so he declares me in front of the father
3202938 that was the main reason i am going to be just worshiping god in a very special way by doing this
3202939 when jesus says carry your cross and follow me it wasnt to put a cross on your shirt and keep walking the street
3202940 i have met politicians i have met presidents and prime ministers i have met all the leaders of that region
3202941 none of them have a magical solution for this issue they are leading people but they dont know where they are going
3202942 even if they have a way out of this endless circle of violence between the two nations none of them have the courage to do it
3202943 both sides have many parties and every party has its own agenda there are no strong leaders in that region who can make brave decisions
3202944 jesus is not going to give them a political solution but he has changed me and he can change those people to a better people he can teach them how to forgive how to love
3202945 everybody on both sides is hurt not only israelis not only palestinians if we can teach them how to forgive and move on and love their enemies for the next two generations we can build a new leadership for both sides to be able to live together
3202946 now as it is there is no hope for them but jesus its that simple

3203151 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3203152 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3203153 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3203154 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3203155 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3203156 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3203157 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3203158 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3203159 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3203160 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3203161 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3203169 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizeable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3203170 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3203171 we have a number of team members that are pretty religious
3203172 and so in design on the team in our small little microcosm of players out there we tried our best to make sure we werent overtly offending any religious people but yet we wanted to include the idea the concept of religion in the game
3203173 we didnt want to go too far down that path we leave the whole creation of the universe question open obviously as the player youre coming in and playing something like a god directing the evolution of a species but we never really state who you the player are

3203209 i was very firm with vladimir putin and he and i have got a good relationship
3203210 hopefully this will get resolved peacefully there needs to be an international mediation there
3203211 lamarr has played really physical this camp thats what ive been most pleased with
3203212 its very difficult the hardest place to play is when youve got to move closer to the ball because it happens a lot faster with the bigger bodies in there

3203246 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3203247 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3203248 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3203249 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3203250 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3203251 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

3203253 we thought we would end the series with a light fun romantic comedy that is sure to entertain and delight our audiences
3203254 it has been a hit at festivals around the country and in its over seas release
3203255 ty liebermans script struck me as having the makings of a really fun romantic comedy i immediately loved the premise of the wedding movie with a twist
3203256 the situation in which these characters find themselves was compelling on the verge of marriage our groom must choose between his fianc e and his first love
3203257 i felt there was a delightful paradox in the fact that his first love was a man it is both crucial to the story and yet incidental this could happen to anyone thematically i liked how the screenplay took sexual identity out for a spin
3203258 think my best friends wedding with a sexual twist and you get the picture
3203259 the film is a lot of fun and a lot of laughs and our audience is on the guest list of a very funny wedding
3203260 the artists at the fiesta are a great expression of the diversity artistry and spirit of the community

3203280 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks

3203446 el esp ritu santo hab a pedido de nuevo la palabra
3203447 el esp ritu santo siempre desordena los proyectos de los hombres
3203448 la iglesia es enteramente ella misma a partir del momento en que se trascienden los criterios y las modalidades de las instituciones humanas
3203449 en peligro la estructura y vitalidad de su naturaleza espiritual
3203450 la distinci n entre cristo y el esp ritu es correcta s lo si gracias a su diversidad logramos entender mejor su unidad
3203451 no es posible entender a partir de esta esquematizaci n la naturaleza y deberes de los movimientos y ellos mismos est n muy lejos de entenderse de tal manera
3203452 coherente con la naturaleza hist rica de la fe y de la iglesia
3203453 un marco s lido por otro deja espacios abiertos de reflexi n que a n no han sido agotados
3203454 ellos se hab an convertido en los sucesores de los ap stoles y que el mandato apost lico reca a sobre sus espaldas
3203455 a ellos les toca e ireneo lo subraya vigorosamente impedir que la iglesia se transforme en una confederaci n de iglesias locales yuxtapuestas y que conserve su unidad y universalidad
3203456 el elemento universal que va m s all de los servicios a las iglesias locales permanece como una necesidad imprescindible
3203457 no s lo hist ricamente inevitable sino tambi n teol gicamente indispensable gracias a ella se manifest la unidad del sacramento y la unidad intr nseca del servicio apost lico
3203458 el cristianismo integral la iglesia que obedeciendo al evangelio viva de l
3203459 el papa necesita los servicios y misiones de car cter universal y stos necesitan de l y en la reciprocidad de los dos tipos de misi n se cumple la sinfon a de la vida eclesial
3203460 primado de pedro existe para garantizar estos componentes esenciales de la vida eclesial y conectarlos adecuadamente con la estructura de la iglesia local
3203461 un conflicto en el que la culpa puede ser de ambas partes y ambas sufren un desaf o espiritual a su coherencia cristiana
3203462 no es l cito dice ratzinger pretender que todo deba insertarse en una determinada organizaci n de la unidad
3203463 la unidad de la nica iglesia que permanece nica en todas las iglesias locales y como tal se evidencia continuamente en todos los movimientos apost licos
3203464 lo que el aburrimiento puede llevar a hacer a un pre universitario
3203465 the asian oil and gas industry is facing a labour crunch crisis and losing precious talent to the middle east
3203466 what clients tell us is that when they see a sudden upsurge in leave applications especially from the technical and engineering departments they know that a recruiter from the middle east is in town and they can expect resignations to go up within the next 2 3 months
3203467 although the pay differential is higher between the gulf countries and asia the relative value change for a person to move from asia to the gulf is diminishing because of the high cost of living and inflation in the gulf region
3203468 now not only the stereotype hurts if you dont fit within these limited categories and stereotypes you are not black enough to count and at the same time you are black enough to be discriminated against

3203497 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
3203498 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
3203499 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him

3203501 his hit on receiver william cole was 17 yards deep thats a pretty deep drop for a backer and as i said afterwards as nice as it was to see the hit it was also nice to see william cole bounce back up after the hit hes come a long way
3203502 the bassist was like a character from guitar hero a bit cartoonish vaguely foreign and just kind of there
3203503 when he doubted her assertions she made him believe that there was a competition between potential creditors margaretha sch tterin managed to establish a sort of investment trust of treasure hunters by promising them profits of up to 100 000 gulden the use she allegedly made of the money given to her i e to donate it to pious causes in catholic churches could not easily be checked by the creditors she finally left her husband whom she probably managed to deceive with her ghost story too and fled with the money when fischer denounced margaretha schu tterin after her flight he was sentenced to a fine of 14 gulden for unlicensed treasurehunting although he maintained that she had assured him that the treasure hunt had been permitted by the duke

3203517 we have worked out a strategy with the methodist church and it has been agreed that we use the annual conference to preach our stance against the charter
3203518 there are certain clauses in the charter that we find is against our principles the indigenous principles and we are totally against this
3203519 we will also distribute special forms for people to fill out so we will be sure where members of the church stand
3203520 its a fact that majority of the sdl party are members of the methodist church and we share similar views on the charter
3203521 we are so thankful to all our guests and the communities who support our hardees locations
3203522 we believe strongly in being a part of the communities we are fortunate to serve
3203523 my grandfather was a pioneer in our industry a pillar in the community who touched countless lives through his generosity as a business leader and philanthropist my family is committed to continuing the same principles
3203524 excluding the impairment charges we saw improved performance at pnm in june as new electric rates and the emergency fuel clause went into effect
3203525 our baseload power plants continue to show better availability and tnmp had a solid quarter
3203526 after a comprehensive review of our overall business we have decided to pursue strategic alternatives for first choice power
3203527 we remain committed to the texas market structure and believe in the first choice power business model
3203528 considering the pending sale of the gas business our first choice power strategy and as we work to restore the pnm utility to financial health the pnm resources board of directors has reduced the indicated annual dividend payment to 0 50 per share from 0 92 per share
3203529 while this was not an easy decision to make it is a prudent step to improve our liquidity and set a new foundation for long term value creation

3203545 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia

3203558 im in a role now where i dont know what to do really the guys are out there busting their butt for nine innings they come in and they hit and they grind i just sit down and hit thats all i do so i cant be in a leadership role from that position
3203559 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3203560 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3203561 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3203562 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3203563 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3203564 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3203565 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3203566 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3203567 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3203568 if hes found out he doesnt like it well thats the only role we have for him at this time
3203569 he has not shown from a health perspective that hes been able to play every day in the outfield he just has to perform the task thats asked of him
3203570 the evidence shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3203571 it was just so cruel and unthinking and so wrong because there is nothing you can do to prevent yourself being raped it is not illegal to go out and have a drink it is illegal to rape somebody
3203572 it was immoral my immediate reaction was there has got to be some way to fight this
3203573 it used to be that they were always blamed if they were wearing a short skirt today its that they were drinking
3203574 its very important for women whove been victims of rape to get compensation because often its the only acknowledgement you are going to get that you have been a victim of crime given that the conviction rate in this country is only 6
3203575 we have just completed a review of our staff instructions operating procedures and structure to ensure greater consistency in decision making
3203576 reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3203577 it seemed like since there was limewire available and that it was open and so out there and very popular that it was ok to do
3203578 and i think its really important to get the message out there that this is whats happening
3203579 i havent seen a roof this bad for a long time
3203580 they saw this on problem solvers and they just looked at each other and said lets get involved
3203581 we went to our suppliers and said this is what we want to do and they all just jumped on board
3203582 a very reputable roofing company called me out of the blue and said im responding to komo 4 problem solvers and wed like to do your roof
3203583 he was like wow and he was in a lot of pain that i remember that day
3203584 it just restored my faith in humanity that there are people out there who care and want to help people
3203585 i have no words to say expect thank you million thanks
3203586 our guys have certain things that they each do well but we may not have the one guy who can do it all
3203587 kevin boss is going to be a good receiver hes going to make a lot of catches i think he is going to be the first one to tell you that he needs to continue to work on his blocking
3203588 when they come out of the game they get excited they started talking to me about where these defenders are and we look at the tape and it wasnt that way at all
3203589 a lot of times youre trying to figure out whats going on in the secondary how theyre rotating the safeties and where the blitz is coming from sometimes there is confusion
3203590 we had a couple of bad things happen on the edge of the defense really that halted our drives because they were both critical situations in the game
3203591 with the youth at tackle when the younger players go in there were just all holding on and hoping they can recall what weve done
3203592 a work that should be made into a movie for young people now clothing food and housing are in abundance in our modern society and yet we carry an unfulfilled vacuum in our hearts it is time to face this new perception to our existence through the kildren who live indefinitely in eternal adolescence and this theme should be dealt with now
3203593 our approach as offensive linemen is the same no matter whos back there
3203594 in that sense nothings changed but what hes done on the field speaks for itself hes a valuable player an important part of the equation and well treat him that way
3203595 a process still needs to go on between brett and us because we still have to get to know the guy
3203596 were all anxious to get that started and move on
3203597 a work that should be made into a movie for young people now
3203598 it is time to face this new perception to our existence through the kildren who live indefinitely in eternal adolescence and this theme should be dealt with now
3203599 as the most difficult among all of my works for film adaptation
3203600 surprised and relieved at the same time to know the director was going to be mamoru oshii
3203601 when youre on a run like that you just have to milk it enjoy it we were able to get a lot of stops and from those stops we were able to score that got us going offensively
3203602 it was the first time they werent doubling the post
3203603 we played them in the last olympics and then in the world championships
3203604 the difference between 2004 and 2006 its like they have these tendencies that traditional chinese teams have had which is a lot of movement i mean a lot of movement penetration cutting pass pass pass pass very quick
3203605 and then tom maher got here and he put in a western kind of style now you see their original style mixed with his its hard to guard i know you look at the score and we played well but theyre going to be a tough opponent for anybody they face in this tournament
3203606 anyone on this team could do it any given night
3203607 i dont feel the defeat today brings too much pressure
3203608 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned

3203624 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west and adhering to western political and economic values as such the fate of georgia should be of grave concern to americans and all people who welcomed the end of a divided of europe and the independence of former soviet republics the international response to this crisis will determine how russia manages its relationships with other neighbors
3203625 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world world history is often made in remote obscure countries it is being made in georgia today it is the responsibility of the leading nations of the world to ensure that history continues to be a record of humanitys progress toward respecting the values and security of free people

3203644 you have a cockswinging irreverence for academic formality yet backed up your topic with solid analytical methodology
3203645 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion
3203646 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question
3203647 created a solution to a problem that does not exist
3203648 rather than focus on building consensus for a budget that addresses californias long term fiscal problems the governor seems adamant on picking a fight over whether state employees are entitled to the wages they have worked for and earned

3203654 i failed in school and i failed at this how many times do i have to take a test to convince myself that i just got shortchanged in the brains department
3203655 outside of trevor nobody has ever believed in me this much
3203656 i dont cheat on my husband if thats what youre asking
3203657 some husbands think its ok for their wives to deal with their loneliness in other ways
3203658 i vowed never to be with another man but theres a really great alternative

3203660 mary is way too self involved to take her own life
3203661 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
3203662 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
3203663 higher and higher in the tree the valves are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
3203664 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
3203665 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
3203666 and thats what we see at the tops of very tall trees the foliage is struggling to get enough water and seems to be under drought stress its not unusual to see periodic die back at the tops of very tall douglas fir trees that are near their height limits

3203669 you simply dont develop a new hyper weaponized strain of anthrax powder for military defense and then commission the top u s anthrax expert to report on this new weapons capability and lethality from mailed delivery unless thats how you foresee it being used
3203670 the possibility that financial gain was the motive behind the anthrax mailings
3203671 a contradictory announcement was relayed the same day december 21 2001 by ohio senator mike dewine based on an abc news report concerning a bmi employee who had been under fbi investigation for an anthrax threat fbi director robert mueller had according to
3203672 last week i phoned the fbi why i asked when the evidence was so abundant did the trail appear to have gone cold the investigation is continuing the spokesman replied has it gone cold because it has led you to a government office i asked he put down the phone
3203673 the armys development of weaponized anthrax the processed ames strain for example directly contravenes both the biological weapons convention and domestic law so does its plan to test live microbes in aerosol chambers at the edgewood chemical biological center also in maryland so does its development of a genetically modified fungus for attacking coca crops in colombia and gm bacteria for destroying materials belonging to enemy forces these as the research group project sunshine has discovered appear to be just a tiny sample of the illegal offensive biological research programmes which the us government has secretly funded
3203674 this appears to be the case and explains the fbis capricious explanations to the press
3203675 in 1957 at the dugway proving grounds in utah the q fever toxin was discharged by an airborne f 100a plane
3203676 riddle of the spores why has the fbi investigation into the anthrax attacks stalled
3203677 public health expert says solving the anthrax mailing mystery may be easy fbi doesnt seem interested
3203678 this report measures our progress in fighting gangs guns and drugs and we must closely examine these crime trends and increases so that we can reduce violent crime at every level
3203679 the one who marched to the sea with death and devastation in his wake
3203680 tracy the cameras been in the jeep all day its right there
3203681 i made the suggestion he waits until friday and does it in front of our people
3203682 if everything goes well i think in a couple days
3203683 i feel like ive been making good progress every day taking a good step forward each time
3203684 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3203685 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3203686 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3203687 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3203688 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3203689 i heard he misses it so he wanted to come stay in a dorm again
3203690 i told him id like him to come spend a couple days visit and have him visit with the team here one of these nights before we leave
3203691 the thing i learned having been through it is it takes the same things to go there and lose that it took to go there and win
3203692 getting there is so hard everybody works hard you have to find a way to work harder everybody works smart you have to find a way to work a little smarter then you have to be lucky
3203693 everyone has to do it his own way with his own philosophy
3203694 i told him so last year was a tough year but you can come out of a tough year better for having the experience everybody goes through that adversity
3203695 i made a mistake by leaving but i cant go back and change it i thought i was doing the right thing and i knew shortly after that i wasnt doing the right thing
3203696 well first of all if you are a religious person you understand that once religion takes hold in a society it cant be stopped
3203697 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3203698 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3203699 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3203700 come to crazy dubyas used cars where anyone can buy a car unless youre a democrat

3203712 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3203713 i cant make this decision for you but this is my concern you are at a good age to consider marriage but its going to be a couple of years before he could even think about proposing continuing this relationship means two things for you 1 postponing marriage until he can finish his studies and find a job 2 hoping that he doesnt change his mind over the next few years this could work for you but i want you to be aware of the risks
3203714 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime
3203715 direct to retail is proving to be just what the retailers are looking for were seeing major orders and growing interest since the inception of d2r just two weeks ago the reception is very enthusiastic
3203716 offering the newest titles for homegrown adds another great element to an already amazing monthly special d2r is proving to be a wonderful business move for ppm and beneficial for retailers too with our continued promotions with the best and most varied new titles
3203717 right now there is an ethnic cleansing of georgians in abkhazia
3203718 to come off the terrible month that we had in cincinnati and you get a phone call today saying youre being traded to a first place team as a player thats all you could ask for
3203719 i made the suggestion he waits until friday and does it in front of our people
3203720 if everything goes well i think in a couple days
3203721 i feel like ive been making good progress every day taking a good step forward each time
3203722 we needed to name it something different from our sam linebacker because we still have some of our sam stuff in our package
3203723 we use that jack term in some of our other packages and shoot its a common name jack
3203724 its like a linebacker slash safety because im in the box most of the time
3203725 you have to learn a lot because you have to know your checks and where to line up its my responsibility to line up the d line most of the time
3203726 youve got to have a guy that can play the game not only as a linebacker but as a safety type a hybrid safety is what i keep calling it
3203727 its still a 4 3 package its no more or no less we do the same things with that body that we did in the spring with an outside linebacker
3203728 we just ended up putting a guy in there because with the depth situation we felt those guys fit well there
3203729 youve got to bring it when youre taking on them blocks because its linemen and stuff
3203730 you cant be too small and play this position you know im kind of middle ways to being a linebacker so ive got some size
3203731 its something different but i like it it gives me a better chance to make more plays up front
3203732 youre seeing us each day move some guy around just to see if we can still find that guy and i think were getting closer
3203733 i think the fact that they can play a lot of different positions is only going to help us in the long run
3203734 at our two inside linebacker positions its kind of a wait and see
3203735 we do have a temporary setback with burton not being there with wendel not being there with them not being there we are developing more depth
3203736 those guys who are practicing and are developing depth they have to understand theyre not just there to be a backup but theyre striving to be a starter
3203737 i cant just make them appear i think i have a solid group of guys they love to work hard they enjoy competing
3203738 our job is to grind here over the next few weeks and get us ready for the opening game
3203739 uma invas o militar completa da ge rgia est acontecendo

3203748 i got an and one dunk and i missed the free throw with 6 seconds left we had to foul them and they made both of their free throws
3203749 i finished with 17 points i didnt play in the 3rd quarter because i was in foul trouble
3203750 he had a minor concussion his father didnt want him to play
3203751 he can handle the basketball and run the offense i think he needs to work on being more consistent with his jump shot and just being able to see the floor a little bit better
3203752 i think derrick is a manchild derrick is a beast he could be the next
3203753 i think he has to get a little bit more comfortable with his handle and his outside jump shot but thats about it because he plays defense hes good around the basket he has good post moves he just has to be more consistent with his jump shot and his free throws
3203754 these young guys theyre playing hard and theyre very talented its just good to see kids who are being successfull and excelling in their sports and just to be able to be there as a mentor and seem them grow and hopefully one day meet them in the nba

3203758 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
3203759 the evidence shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3203760 it was just so cruel and unthinking and so wrong because there is nothing you can do to prevent yourself being raped it is not illegal to go out and have a drink it is illegal to rape somebody
3203761 it was immoral my immediate reaction was there has got to be some way to fight this
3203762 it used to be that they were always blamed if they were wearing a short skirt today its that they were drinking
3203763 its very important for women whove been victims of rape to get compensation because often its the only acknowledgement you are going to get that you have been a victim of crime given that the conviction rate in this country is only 6
3203764 we have just completed a review of our staff instructions operating procedures and structure to ensure greater consistency in decision making
3203765 reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3203766 i am only prejudiced against bmw drivers insofar as they are a bunch of arrogant headlight flashing rear bumper caressing road hoggers who believe they own the road and that all other cars should stand aside to make way for them at any time of day or night other than this i have nothing at all against them
3203767 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
3203768 we are for peace but not for peace at any price not peace with a gun to our heads
3203769 instead of creating peace it can cause a dismemberment of our country
3203770 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on 28 feb but the situation has deteriorated
3203771 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from having volunteered to serve the country the king and the people
3203772 come back and die on the thai soil like every other thai person
3203773 such remarks by the former leader could damage the countrys image in its suggestion that we have an unjust judicial system
3203774 thailand remains a good country with a great amount of justice

3203776 pagi ini misi rusia untuk nato mengusulkan digelarnya pertemuan luar biasa dewan nato rusia kami menekankan bahwa sebelum menyampaikan pernyataan nato perlu mendapatkan fakta

3203779 you may not use your card for any illegal transactions at casinos or any gambling activity
3203780 when unsure whether an item is in presentable shape or not ask yourself if youd buy it

3203782 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3203783 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software

3203785 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3203786 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3203787 it gives me a lot of confidence but at the same time weve still got three more preseason games
3203788 im not thinking about making the team just thinking about getting my job down
3203789 its a whole different role bumping out from guard to tackle
3203790 its a bit easier moving from right to left than for him to go from guard to tackle
3203791 we have some guys banged up a little bit and thats camp hopefully we dont lose very many
3203792 ive always been a small guy ever since i started playing football since i was 6 running around in the backyard
3203793 just because im smaller than them some guys think they can have an easy win thats what i love about football because the one thing you cant see is your heart
3203794 any chance you get if you get one rep you got to make sure you do your best and make sure somebody notices
3203795 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
3203796 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
3203797 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
3203798 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
3203799 ten year old girls at a hannah montana concert had nothing on our news media as they took in barack obama s july trip to benighted foreign lands obama world tour 2008 t shirts were figuratively speaking on the backs of practically everyone in his press entourage this tour proved we are led to believe that obama is serious about foreign policy just as george w bush s ignorance of the names of leaders of then obscure asian countries was supposed to indicate his lack of concern about the subject back in 2000
3203800 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3203801 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3203802 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3203803 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3203804 recently congress passed the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act also known as the housing bill its passage was lauded by many who are legitimately concerned about foreclosures and the housing market in our countrys economy i was asked how i could vote against a bill to help american homeowners but i found this bill to have more to do with helping big banks than helping average americans
3203805 on july 29 the sec announced that it would extend its original 10 day restriction on naked short sales of 19 major financial companies through august 12 analysts across the board agree that this particular sec rule by itself will have little effect except to raise transaction costs for those wishing to short fannie mae freddie mac goldman sachs jp morgan and other powerhouses
3203806 come on do you think anyone lookin like this is goin to get to heaven
3203807 imagine a story about collapse of the real estate markets that states most of the millions piled up in paper profits had melted away many of the millions sunk in developments had been sunk for good and all the vast inverted pyramid of credit had toppled to earth and the lesson of the economic falsity of a scheme of land values based upon grandiose plans preposterous expectations and hot air had been taught in a long agony of deflation
3203808 i advance the notion that the key to winning elections is simply working harder get out and meet your neighbors develop a record of community activism and learn how to deflect any attack and stay on message whether you are running for president or dogcatcher or anything in between you are really running for next door neighbor the key to winning then is to be known as a good neighbor
3203809 the concept of a holy war has been given new expression in the recent policy of military humanitarianism adopted by the united states and the united nations for example the bombing of serbia and the military occupation of bosnia have been justified by the much publicized need to prevent ethnic cleansing in the region the announced motive behind these military aggressions was considered so holy that the standard protocols of international conflict such as a declaration of war or territorial aggression on the part of the enemy were forsworn yet protocol is the essence of a holy war especially as that concept has been developed in catholic just war theory
3203810 cell phones have really come into their own in the last few years even relatively spartan phones can now take pictures send text messages and ease the pain of commuting with a game of brickbreaker these technological marvels can even send and receive telephone calls it gets better

3203812 they were there for a while she had a lovely time everyone thought she was very lovely
3203813 our approach to security software and optimization tools has been to offer consumers the flexibility to choose an appropriate solution whether it is a combination of standalone products or a comprehensive and fully integrated package to meet individual consumer needs
3203814 our approach to the 2009 range is no exception to this philosophy
3203815 for the eighth time in the last ten years and the eighth quarter in a row we have generated double digit earnings per share growth
3203816 no importa con cu nto gane el gobierno o los prefectos opositores igual deben buscar acuerdos
3203817 tanto la encuesta como la tranquilidad con la que se realiz el refer ndum demuestran que los bolivianos de todas las regiones coinciden en la convicci n de que cualquier diferencia de opini n o de intereses hay que resolverla hablando y escuchando y no a trav s de la violencia o la imposici n

3203985 ive had such a great time in college that i wouldnt trade it in for anything
3203986 for playing me right now for playing a guy like me whos just coming back not fresh its a great strategy cause im gonna make a lot of errors and im gonna get tired out there
3203987 the adjustments i would have had to make today i just didnt have the legs to make them but thats where its tough being a serve and volleyer you have to move faster
3203988 right now just playing three sets out here is pretty taxing on my body and i just need a little more time to get ready for the three out of five sets

3204015 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat

3204018 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of those moments we choose we either take a risk and move toward what we want or we play it safe and choose comfort most of the people most of the time choose comfort in the end people either have excuses or experiences reasons or results buts or brilliance they either have what they wanted or they have a detailed list of all the rational reasons why not

3204020 you will be what you will to be let failure find its false content in that poor word environment but spirit scorns it and is free it masters time it conquers space it cows that boastful trickster chance and bids the tyrant circumstance uncrown and fill a servants place the human will that force unseen the offspring of a deathless soul can hew the way to any goal though walls of granite intervene be not impatient in delay but wait as one who understands when spirit rises and commands the gods are ready to obey the river seeking for the sea confronts the dam and precipice yet knows it cannot fail or miss you will be what you will to be

3204027 when you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality other people get killed not you then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you after being severely wounded two weeks before my 19th birthday i had a bad time until i figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me whatever i had to do men had always done if they had done it then i could do it too and the best thing was not to worry about it
3204028 the minute you start talking about what youre going to do if you lose you have lost

3204031 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3204032 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3204033 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3204034 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3204035 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3204036 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3204037 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that

3204051 some communities are going to be very challenged to remain as they are and we are going to have to have honest conversations with people if you want to live there thats ok but dont expect the government to somehow build a clinic and put a school in for kids or whatever it may be
3204052 moving will not be easy nor will it be possible or sensible for all but mobility will be a big part of the structural adjustment story in remote aboriginal society the challenge for government is to stop funding programs that militate against the migratory solution
3204053 how are we supposed to survive if our money is quarantined how do we pay our bills how are we supposed to pay for austar television services car repairs or fuel or get to alice springs and back to yuendumu with all the prices so high
3204054 aboriginal people thought that if labor got in they would stop the intervention that theyd get rid of it but it hasnt happened and instead theyre fully supporting it we are the first australians and the government should be looking after us we were supposed to have equal rights in 1967

3204069 gasoline is something that we buy a lot of because our trucks run on it we use a lot of electricity and the electric rates have gone up several times since we raised our rates the last time
3204070 we dont like raising rates we would prefer not to but the costs of operating the business have risen to the point now where with all of the efficiencies with all the cost saving measures and all the things we do to be as efficient as we possibly can we cannot off set these rising cost

3204101 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3204102 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3204103 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3204104 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3204105 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3204106 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3204107 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3204108 these are things that were always recommended and should be done
3204109 were now requiring them because we have a better chance of getting more kids into the doctors office into the immunizations clinics so that they get the immunizations
3204110 the more things that we can prevent them from getting the better off we are

3204115 as a teenager i heard john kennedys summons to citizenship and then as a student at georgetown i heard that call clarified by a professor named carroll quigley who said to us that america was the greatest nation in history because our people had always believed in two things that tomorrow can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal moral responsibility to make it so
3204116 the methods can be summed up under three headings a a triple front penetration in politics education and journalism b the recruitment of men of ability chiefly from certain universities and the linking of these men to the group by matrimonial alliances and by gratitude for titles and positions of power and c the influencing of public policy by placing members of the group in positions of power shielded as much as possible from public attention
3204117 eastern establishment has played a very significant role in the history of the united states in the last generation
3204118 quite simply the law demands more specific knowledge as to which items are infringing and which seller is listing those items before requiring ebay to take action
3204119 unfortunately the trial court incorrectly held that trademark holders and not ebay are responsible for policing the ebay site the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3204120 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3204121 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3204122 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3204123 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3204124 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3204125 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting

3204136 before using deadline managing our render farm was a real thorn in my side ive since become a total deadline evangelist and sing its praises to the heavens because it just works we never have to worry about what we push through the render farm i leave it running overnight and when i look at the logs in the morning id see that deadline was doing a massive amount of behind the scenes housekeeping deadline is simply brilliant
3204137 our growing list of customers and testimonials is proof that deadline is addressing the needs of vfx studios regardless of size were constantly hearing about deadlines reliability ease of integration and use and how it gives facilities peace of mind because deadline enables them to get the job done on time
3204138 a shell is a command interpreter which allows the user to interact with the computer

3204143 while verisign may experience modestly slower growth for its domain name and ssl certificate units given our belief there is minimal risk to new expectations the company is over delivering on margins and expects a positive impact from share repurchases we see opportunity at current levels we also continue to like the solid growth and visibility of verisigns business model our target is based upon our dcf analysis plus 3 for discontinued operations this represents a 22x multiple on our 2009 pro forma eps estimate of 1 48 after adjusting for the 3 for the discontinued ops this is a slight premium to our estimated long term earnings growth rate of 21

3204147 our findings may have important benefits for a wide range of applications of cnt surfaces such as design of biosensors smart composites variable lenses and display screen
3204148 this novel material could have advantages in many fields of nanotechnology like mems nems where we can either pin up or roll liquid drops by applying an electric field for example this would enable further advances such as droplet based microfluidic devices a new generation of electrically switchable microreactors adjustable lenses lab on a chip devices smart window glasses with alternate electric field initiated hydrophobic hydrophilic behavior for automotive applications tunable aerospace coating which which will prevent ice formation etc
3204149 electric field induced superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic switching in multiwalled carbon nanotube papers
3204150 tuning the wetting properties of multiwalled carbon nanotubes by surface functionalization
3204151 a continuous decrease in the contact angle with respect to direct current voltage shows a remarkable tuning of the surface properties of nanotube paper especially with respect to its change in its surface oxygen content
3204152 the liquid remains suspended at the top of the bucky paper and forms a stable immobile ball because of a slight pinning action with an angle of 156 interestingly the application of electric field induces a transition from the superhydrophobic to the hydrophilic state where the immobile droplet undergoes a distortion which could be seen even with the naked eye however some of the liquid penetrates through the bucky paper substrate as a result of this transition this could be attributed to the fact that the electrical energy induces both external and internal wetting capillarity due to the filling of the lumen of mwcnts
3204153 if you have a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic biomolecules that need to be separated you you would first use a cartridge with the bucky paper to selectively remove hydrophobic components then you apply an electric field and remove the hydrophilic components
3204154 come on my friend lets get a good fire going ill soon have these ready for roasting and what a fine dinner we shall have

3204173 why dont you ever listen to me why did you buy me if youre never going to follow my directions
3204174 we have been at the forefront of the climate change issue for years a large percentage of our electricity already comes from renewable energy sources and we are in the tropics we dont have problems heating up our homes and buildings during the winter
3204175 the first thing is measuring what the emissions actually are then were looking at ways that we can do our agricultural practices better to reduce the emissions in addition to production we are also involved in transportation so we are also looking at ways of being more fuel efficient
3204176 you can see the growth here in the tropics its incredible in four months they can grow 50 to 60cm
3204177 the tree starts absorbing carbon dioxide from when its a seedling especially during the first 10 to 15 years its a very efficient way of absorbing carbon from the atmosphere
3204178 costa rica has been the only country in central america ahead of everyone else in terms of protecting the environment
3204179 i believe this is the first step to mitigate even more the impact they have on climate change the only thing i see is a little bit problematic is by 2021 its a huge target
3204180 the real challenge for costa rica is transportation most of our emissions come from this sector we really have to start making changes in how costa ricans are moving but as the economy grows if more people want to have their own cars we have to take that in to account
3204181 we are in the right position in this country to be the crucible for the changes that the rest of the world is looking for we cannot let it fail we need to get everyone on our side to make this small experiment in something very radical but very necessary to work
3204182 we need to be an example to the rest of the world

3204197 to introduce our guests to another new destination each dish was created to reflect the culinary influences found in the city
3204198 were bringing lovely tuscan fare into our kitchen and to our guests
3204199 weve created dishes and a menu that not only reflect coasts commitment to quality but also represent true west coast delights
3204200 theres no doubt that there are negative consequences to people within the state which is certainly why we want to get this done sooner rather than later
3204201 all it takes is a small number of legislators who as they are doing this year do not offer a public alternative that can hold up the budget and that penalizes all of us
3204202 in reality this move simply formalises what has long been a natural fit between the two organisations whilst removing the duplication of policy development resource investment and membership services
3204203 natroad and the australian road train association have always been grass roots driven coal face representative organisations and this would be core to the new entitys operating principles

3204205 che cosa ha fatto di male quella donna per essere messa in una cella
3204206 e una indesiderata unemarginata una donna che forse vittima di una tratta e che cerca di vivere o sopravvivere con il proprio corpo e questo in una italia sempre pi intollerante diventata una colpa
3204207 essere poveri sta diventando un crimine e in questa fascia di nuovi perseguitati i pi deboli sono gli immigrati e le donne ci sono troppe lucciole che sono schiave e si vendono sui marciapiedi perch minacciate da chi le ha fatte arrivare in italia
3204208 le retate anti prostituzione continua servono solo a fare impazzire le lucciole che scappano da una citt allaltra o da un quartiere allaltro in cerca di un clima pi tollerante la ragazza fotografata chieder mai aiuto a chi lha trattenuta in quella cella si fider mai delle forze dellordine anche se vittima della tratta non glielo dir e se insieme alle sue colleghe sar cacciata in un cono dombra ancora maggiore ad esempio se sar costretta a prostituirsi in un appartamento non incontrer neppure volontari in grado di spiegargli che pu entrare in un percorso di protezione i sindaci sceriffo stanno cavalcando il tema della prostituzione ottenendo come unico effetto quello di criminalizzare chi avrebbe bisogno di protezione
3204209 trovo vergognoso continua corso riferendosi alla foto quel corpo abbandonato a terra in un comando di polizia municipale trovo vergognoso che i nostri poliziotti carabinieri e vigili urbani controllino gli immigrati senza informarli dei loro diritti e che si scambi la prostituzione per un problema di sicurezza
3204210 siamo scettici nei confronti delle ordinanze dei sindaci nati sulla scia della carta di parma e delle retate anti prostituzione le forze dellordine dovrebbero essere inviate in strada non a fare multe ma a capire i meccanismi che soggiacciono a certi fenomeni dovrebbero essere preparati per leggere i segnali capire se di fronte hanno donne vittime dello sfruttamento o meno sarebbe necessario guardare in faccia la realt e trovare soluzioni pragmatiche ad esempio zone in cui la prostituzione possa avvenire alla luce del sole invece di alimentare o cavalcare politicamente la percezione dinsicurezza dei cittadini
3204211 almeno voi clienti di parma siate onesti voi che siete sempre riusciti a eludere chiss come mai i controlli della municipale e dei carabinieri unitevi per aiutare le donne che stuprate comprategli un appartamento collettivo cos almeno il sindaco sar contento sotto il tappeto della malavita la polvere del degrado non si muove e parma risplender pi che mai

3204226 later this evening i intend to watch the video in question click the reply link above the box reserved for user comments and draft a response being careful to put as little thought into it as possible while making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
3204227 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
3204228 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
3204229 it is my moral obligation to alert the internet community to the fact that this video is totally gay and furthermore that the individual who made it is a fag
3204230 after clicking the submit button i will immediately refresh the page so that i can view my own comment i will then notice that my comment has not appeared because the server has not yet processed my request become angry and confused and re post the same comment with unintentional variations on the original wording and misspellings creating two slightly different yet equally moronic comments
3204231 it is my hope that this will illustrate both my childlike level of impatience and my inability to replicate a simple string of letters and symbols 30 seconds after having composed it
3204232 once this minor diversion is complete i will finish posting my comment then sit there like the worthless human being i am and wait for other commenters to respond
3204233 because as i mentioned before i have nothing better to do with my life
3204234 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment
3204235 what better way to take advantage of this incredible technology than to log onto the internet and insult a complete stranger
3204236 brandons comments in particular contain a degree of unoriginality and stupidity that you only see in the most muttonheaded and imbecilic internet commenters
3204237 in fact ive seen him use at least a dozen variations of the word gay suffice it to say brandon mylenek is a truly stupid stupid idiot

3204321 many other vendors are putting hypervisors in the market by themselves without the operating system thats like having just a mousepad and no mouse theres not much you can do with it

3204358 12 and i thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry 13 who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief 14 and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus 15 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief 16 howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting

3204361 9 i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators 10 yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world 11 but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat 12 for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within
3204362 15 i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil 16 they are not of the world even as i am not of the world 17 sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth 18 as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world
3204363 14 for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you 15 but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses
3204364 but when jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick 13 but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance

3204370 the safari park zoological park in caney kansas experienced quite a stir last month when a rare white tiger mother refused contact with her newborn cubs to the rescue was the parks golden retriever isabella who took over their care and feeding isabella became an overnight celebrity
3204371 so the next day when the cubs were looking for some motherly care harvey introduced them to isabella an impossibly puppy faced year old retriever still producing milk from her own pregnancy the protective pooch immediately took to feeding licking and cleaning the cubs as if they were her own and has continued to do so throughout the week

3204391 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3204392 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on
3204393 they are on the central highway which links the east and west of georgia this is the situation people are leaving their villages they have been told by policemen to leave their villages and houses
3204394 its a very bad situation people are in panic nobody knows what to do this road where the troops are is about 2kms from the city centre its very near the road is closed now
3204395 this is a classical full scale invasion under the umbrella of peace enforcement
3204396 half of georgia is under russian control our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of tbilisi we will fight defending tbilisi
3204397 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3204398 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia
3204399 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3204400 the pre planned cold blooded murder of a small country
3204401 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3204402 they are specifically targeting civilian targets theyve been targeting highways in georgia which are especially crowded at this time of year because of returning holidaymakers

3204419 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
3204420 the devices also failed to detect the presence of wireless microphones when switched on an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game given the poor performance of these sensing devices there is no reason to believe that the other proposed protections such as beacons will be any more capable of providing reliable and robust interference protection to wireless microphone transmissions

3204422 since the programs inception nasa has been working an aggressive plan to achieve flight capability before our march 2015 target
3204423 we are still confident the constellation program will make its first flight to the international space station on or before that date
3204424 the introduction of the a p meter was a significant and necessary step forward in measuring television the way people watch it in the digital era without the a p meter we would have had no way to measure dvrs vod and other digital television as is sometimes the case with new product roll outs the initial a p meter had some software glitches we established a special a p meter team to address these issues and over the past year we have introduced new software enhancements that have addressed these issues we also discovered that a number of local stations around the country had been improperly encoding their programs which had exposed them to potential miscrediting we implemented an aggressive education program to make sure all stations understand how to use the encoding equipment we also developed special diagnostics that can help us identify encoding issues at local stations
3204425 other folks were affected and i do not think nielsen did a particularly good job taking care of business in phoenix frankly just the idea that they had to create two supersites read below i mean that is a highly unusual event so therefore where theres smoke theres fire
3204426 what youve heard about the ap meters is exactly correct it has limitations that frankly nielsen is not necessarily willing to step up to the table and admit however that needs to be their position going forward and weve said as much they need to be aggressively challenging those limitations the ap meter has because it is the technology of record and with markets going to 100 ap thats going to be the meter there are problems with that meter nielsen has detected them other companies have detected them but more importantly they need to get to all of that before they impact the marketplace but that train has already left the station so thats not going to happen its reactionary they have resisted the final rigorous scrutiny and seal of approval before implementing a new technology into the marketplace and they begin to manufacture currency the jury is not in yet and it affects everybody whos a stakeholder in the game indeed theyve proven with the situations such as the ones were talking about that its just not working correctly
3204427 were the first company to admit that this is a challenging difficult today with all of the technologies at work and choices in viewing technology out in the marketplace but theyre it theyve chosen to be this provider of currency that we use that supports an industry
3204428 they have their coding and encoding process which they certainly refer to when there are gaps they have methodology that they use for purposes of filling those gaps in thats a very proprietary and secretive process that few if any have gotten to look at they write the code that basically says that if the technology doesnt demonstrate that a certain pattern of viewing is going on then we have a way of determining it with some other variables were left with unexplainable precipitous drops weve demonstrated in phoenix countless examples where they have miscoded programming where it just wasnt being credited to the right source but i find that out and i tell nielsen it should work the other way around they should have whatever processes in place to head that off i shouldnt have to be the watchdog we have had to go as a company along with many other companies through some fairly extensive additional costs and expense just to have checks and balances in place with nielsen thats both an outside consultant human resource and weve had to go out and purchase technology that monitors what they do weve installed that in all of our current lpm markets and well install that same equipment as lpm comes online for us in our other markets because we simply feel the confidence level is not there
3204429 when we switched to lpms in phoenix a small number of clients raised issues about potential a p issues
3204430 robbed the boston tv station of advertising revenue estimated by one ad exec at potentially more than 2 m
3204431 while manually recalculating ratings for the games nielsen researchers uncovered an encoding error that had wrongly credited espn with close to two million viewers who were actually watching on wcvb nielsen had previously credited viewers watching wcvb feeds of the game on cable satellite and via telephone fiber which represents 75 of the boston market to espn the recalculation determined that wcvbs household rating for patriots ravens on december 3 should have been a 24 4 compared to the previously reported 8 5
3204432 people werent encoding and it was a simulcast it was a situation which i think brought to the attention to all of our clients the importance of ensuring they are encoding all of their distribution channels working with the clients what weve done is develop procedures we try to play now a very active role ensuring that everyones got all their distribution channels encoded correctly
3204433 the mrc i think considers super sites a very effective way providing assurances that all the coding and everything is working correctly its always a matter of interpreting things but i think super sites are what i conceive would be a good thing to do
3204434 in 2007 there were some occasional issues at wcvb which had been caused by improper encoding once we discovered the improper coding this issue was resolved earlier this year we also discovered a highly unusual technical glitch in which simulcast programming from one affiliate was in a small number of households being credited to another affiliate station in the boston market this situation was resolved and a review of the data found that this glitch caused had only a small impact on the ratings for either affiliate
3204435 george ivie and his staff in the interest of making sure our clients knew that we were buttoned up on this were invited to participate in our monthly operations meeting for a day a few weeks ago quite frankly i can say this because its not audit related george wrote a very flattering note to the clients what the sentiment in the marketplace is and certainly based on stuff that ive read in the last couple of weeks i think there will be issues that pop up as we get new experiences in new markets weve just got to be really fast to identify any of those and make sure weve got them locked up immediately i understand that we worked with our clients over the past several months especially as we go into new markets and work through idiosyncrasies as we characterize that market
3204436 first of all thats not really how we work it has to be an extreme circumstance where we would go to them and say were pulling accreditation
3204437 well thats different thats a newly accredited service i mean you wouldnt believe how many thousands of hours most people in the industry have no idea what we do to try to protect things but we spend thousands of hours with the ppm and we are working on the details with arbitron and were just not going to accredit it until we feel like its right
3204438 nielsen is not in the same category and also mission wise im telling you this company is trying to nail this
3204439 i can tell you the mrc does an amazing amount of good a lot of what you see coming out for rating services that we audit and im not just talking about nielsen im talking about arbitron mri simmons scarborough all the companies we audit a lot of what you see being introduced by these companies we drive especially the quality improvement types of things what allows us to drive this improvement is the relationship that we have with these services where they cannot hide anything from us when we go to talk to nielsen about the ap meter we talked to them about incredible details related to this meter functionality that they wouldnt tell anybody else we know exactly how the meter works weve tested it in a lab every which way you can think of weve tested it out in the field we go visit nielsen households which as you know is a closely guarded secret we actively work with nielsen and we are related through the ap meter to improve quality and ensure accurate measurement weve audited it its in production in essentially all of nielsens accredited meter services to say that its an accreditation barrier is not accurate we have accredited services that have ap meters in them having said that i think that nielsen implemented the ap meter because their old meter technology the mark ii meter was not prepared it was designed in the day when digitalization dvrs on demand and time shifting was not present to this extent so they installed this ap meter to address these concerns and in truth the mrc was pushing them to install this meter also that meter had i think in excess of a decade of research and development behind it from nielsen it has redundant engines in it so that if a station does not encode for a period of time there are backup engines that are supposed know primarily based on signature matching but if its not in a digital environment theres also video codes there are backup engines that are supposed to be able to make credit with the absence of code as an industry i think weve all been focusing on that aspect of the meter to make sure that that works as well as say the pre digitalization mark ii meter before all this digital stuff nielsens mark ii meter did a bang up job it was installed and working on a television that thing it was extremely reliable and all were trying to do is make sure that we have the same level of reliability in the ap meter they have an incredible amount of resources its unprecedented as far as i know ive been associated with nielsen as an auditor and as a director of the mrc for 25 years and the level of effort that nielsen has devoted to making the capabilities of this ap meter robust is unlike anything ive ever seen they have like half of their company really working on this theyve also designated like a top guy within nielsen who used to be their cio
3204440 were confident of strong media investment growth extending to 2009 as demand in china becomes an increasingly important source of growth for global marketers as well as chinese companies focusing on brand building
3204441 growth in 2007 was relatively restrained but we predict many marketers are conserving funds for the anticipated olympic bonanza this year
3204442 china has the worlds largest internet community with more than 250 million users
3204443 thats an increase of more than 90 million from june of last year representing a year to year growth of more than 55
3204444 these numbers showed a rise of 7 1 percent and reflect a rise in general raw materials
3204445 this naturally raises some concerns about inflation and may be one reason the stock market is sliding this morning although investors are also reluctant to buy ahead of tomorrows gdp figures

3204455 there is no earthly info we can know about the oneness all around us the rational is a fingerprint a focus that lures the camera away from its capture the original recording the giant unblinking eye which sees from a time before the calculating mind budged to the head of the class to jabber silly filibuster rambles until weaker minds surrendered to that sleep state where absorption is easier than abortion where the heroic act of destroying reasons fetus becomes too heavy a task due to the thick ever birthing material a spiritual hero must tunnel through just to catch a glimpse of the light

3204468 social entrepreneurship businessweek 12 14 07 has become a hot topic in recent years attracting people filled with the loftiest of intentions who want to do good by doing good but its the tricky feat of running a sustainable operation that is the more elusive goal so when i learned that lubetzky had created a viable business model in operation since 1994 that brings arabs and israelis together while plowing profits into peacemaking efforts i rang up peaceworks new york office and was invited down for a visit
3204469 it really wasnt until i was working with a little cassette player and my girlfriend was singing along with me while i was writing it that it struck me as a duet
3204470 at first i didnt appreciate her singing along but she was in the background there when i listened back to it i thought yes this absolutely should have a girl singing there it sounded great despite the fact that rae cant sing a lick
3204471 when i finished the song i spoke to producer rick rubin about it and he immediately suggested natalie maines he said she was a great singer so we sent the record over to natalie

3204495 the game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition
3204496 the flowers the gorgeous mystic multi colored flowers are not the flowers of life but people yes people are the true flowers of life and it has been a most precious pleasure to have temporarily strolled in your garden
3204497 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
3204498 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
3204499 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something
3204500 you always succeed in making me laugh or cry and think and learn thank you for your blog its a treasure
3204501 youre such a delicate flower i want you to write the blurb for the dust jacket when i finally write my novel
3204502 thats all right erica you can talk dirty to me in kerrville
3204503 you used to be fun you now act like a fascist
3204504 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
3204505 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
3204506 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
3204507 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
3204508 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house
3204509 i like you just the way you are a dooshbag
3204510 girl you are slicker than cow patties on wet dew in the morning and you can play half rubber better than anyone
3204511 one of the sweetest most intelligent and perceptive ladies i have never met
3204512 erica has cornered the market on crap blogging in a highly disgusting but yet entertaining way
3204513 i can have a mason jar of grade a pure d buck goat pee especially delivered to the troll of your choice at any given time
3204514 erica has a heart two sizes too big for her may god bless her and keep her
3204515 omg i so totally rate right now erica has left anti nj words in the comments here on my blog
3204516 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game
3204517 china julia child and yiddish how do these things go together why in a post by erica of course need you ask lol
3204518 i dont do memes and i dont do links i do do gratuitous sex you know my email

3204520 i consider trial by jury as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution

3204522 i was like alice talking to humpty dumpty in through the looking glass
3204523 i consider trial by jury as the only anchor ever
3204524 i wanted to make a good impression for the last time and try hard
3204525 i was just thinking i want to do my best and give it my all and i did
3204526 i didnt leave anything in me and in the end thats why i lost for the bronze medal because i just got so tired and there was nothing left in the body
3204527 we had a favorable reaction from the georgian side and we hope there will be an equally favorable reaction from the russian side
3204528 i cannot see us accepting this draft of a resolution
3204529 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3204530 do we have to pay this kind of a price for good relations with the united states
3204531 i saw a toyota corolla car stopped on the side of road
3204532 then seconds later three military vehicles of foreign troops were about to pass the small car when a strong explosion with dark smoke blackened the area
3204533 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3204534 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3204535 we should convene other international forums to condemn this aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization
3204536 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3204537 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3204538 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3204539 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3204540 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3204541 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3204542 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
3204543 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
3204544 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
3204545 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
3204546 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3204547 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3204548 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3204549 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3204550 being able to bend light in unusual ways is important for applications that almost resemble magic
3204551 there still is a long way to go but the berkeley team made an important step
3204552 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3204553 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3204554 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that rumor would have been burned by it
3204555 i cant say i understand the rules of the media and im not sure they do either
3204556 when we land we were under sniper fire blah blah blah ups i mis spoke
3204557 if it had all been different we would have won
3204558 it will be ok life will go on without hillary she lost and we can not bring the vote back
3204559 the other day i was hanging a clock in my bathroom when i slipped and hit my head on the toilet when i woke up i drew this the flux capacitor
3204560 working is like walking if you enjoy it you never notice it i like to work with plain dirt i like to see things grow in it every shovelful i take from along the curbs will produce food some day ill never get tired of watching that happen
3204561 if the baby has trouble latching on just go with a bottle
3204562 breast feeding falls under the health category which is now a luxury only for the rich we re at war now and fighting terrorism calls for sacrifices from people of all low sectors of our society put down that kid get back to work and don t even think about unionizing
3204563 this is the way its supposed to be mom what have you been doing to me all my life
3204564 when mothers are given at least one half hour every four hours for pumping at work along with a comfortable and private space to do so
3204565 incredibly painful i have no idea what im doing panic that my baby isnt eating enough its 3am its dark and im all alone and i feel like i havent slept in days
3204566 you dont need that expensive college fund or the expensive toys and baby clothing
3204567 not in her own house with the curtains tightly shut and the doors deadbolted
3204568 more support is needed for women so they can achieve this goal
3204569 it s not going to be the ultimate determinant in whether you have a healthy child
3204570 difficulties can arise but most breastfeeding problems can be solved and support is very helpful
3204571 i pumped exclusively for three months with my first child who was never able to latch on despite numerous visits with a lc and hundreds of dollars spent it was hell
3204572 most women stop nursing before the 1 year mark recommended by the american pediatrics association and before the 2 year mark recommended by the who
3204573 you shouldnt put your baby to sleep on his stomach
3204574 well one or two a week is better than one or two every day
3204575 i m not going to judge women who stop because they work in an office or have to travel or don t have support at home or from their doctor yes we need the support and need to find ways to make it easier for women but i also think it s a personal choice
3204576 this goes beyond the expected percentage who find themselves unable to exclusively breastfeed were clearly also witnessing cultural choices and a lack of support
3204577 i would willingly end in the asylum to give my child the best i possibly could
3204578 and for both sides stop judging breast milk is better but giving a kid formula is not the end of the world there are plenty of bright creative people who were raised on formula have been for many years and it hasn t wiped out society and if giving a bottle causes sleep apnea how come it wasn t an epidemic in the 60 s and 70 s when bottle feeding was at its peak
3204579 oh well i couldnt because of x y z flying monkeys lunar eclipse
3204580 but a woman at the park gave me a dirty look when she saw a bottle
3204581 if its hard ill just keep going it will be worth it
3204582 why are you giving that child a bottle you should be nursing instead
3204583 ah ha i never knew that pumping and supplementing was precisely the wrong way to stimulate supply or that there were drugs that just flick the switch to production
3204584 this is the toughest decision any prosecutor has to make
3204585 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3204586 lurching to the right then to the left the old washington dance whatever it takes
3204587 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3204588 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3204589 we believe very deeply that new jersey and new york are in play for senator mccain

3204634 how can this be called a harmonious society if its harmonious wed have a right to stay in beijing and attend the olympics
3204635 to open religious services and make some literature available to a limited number of people during the olympics is a welcome thing but it means nothing in terms of religious freedom in china
3204636 it would mean more if beijing residents are able to access the bible and other religious literature in a public bookstore and if chinese citizens could choose their places of worship without being afraid of harassment being arrested or sent to labor camps
3204637 i dont care if this is a legal church or an illegal one
3204638 in china there are so many things the government doesnt allow but that doesnt mean that everything banned is bad
3204639 everyone should ask themselves what they truly believe in were all adults we have the ability to decide what we believe in to judge what is right or wrong people wont listen just because the government says so
3204640 in a way its a kind of progress that we are still able to operate
3204641 it shows that the government is worried about its international image
3204642 for some big house churches in cities like beijing and shanghai the government might not push too hard because theyre afraid of a backlash or creating an influential news story
3204643 but for small house churches including many in the countryside the crackdown is very serious
3204644 an important reason for the crackdown is the olympics this year chinese leaders face more pressure from outside groups house churches and even ordinary individual citizens
3204645 the public security bureau always misuses its power they have lost their humanity
3204646 in the olympic village you can find religious freedom maybe some foreigners can worship
3204647 but i tell you the real crisis in china now is that there are no reformers left the power struggle among the leadership is for power not reform to have real political reform they would lose their power

3204673 were putting the dollars into the law enforcement that we feel it needs to go into and were asking for a little bit more efficiency over there
3204674 were doing everything we can to put more criminals behind bars and i dont think our budget reflects anything other than that

3204707 im confident that if all parties take ownership in overcoming the current economic challenges we will prevail and grow stronger
3204708 its micro management and bureaucracy that have delayed approvals for applications for services from the government therefore procedures have to be liberalised
3204709 the application forms that we use for various decisions made by the government should not be too detailed like before we should concentrate on getting the essential details and make the forms more simple so decisions can be made faster
3204710 to ensure that the decision making process is made faster we should also empower those at the junior level to make some decisions so that decisions are not concentrated entirely at the top

3204773 so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic

3204786 a cabinet established through such an avenue will lack moral credibility parliament itself will be tarnished both the executive and the legislature two vital arms of governance will be perceived by the people as institutions that are bereft of integrity
3204787 the size and scale of the crossover he envisages is mind boggling has there ever been an instance anywhere in the world where a government which has 58 seats more than the combined opposition is under the constant threat of imminent collapse simply because an individual who is not even in parliament boasts continuously that a certain number of mps are going to switch sides by a certain date
3204788 if the threat of crossovers hangs like a sword of damocles over the nations head it is partly because many malaysians know that anwar as a bn and federal government leader at one time had played a pivotal role in the overthrow of the democratically elected pbs state government in sabah in 1994
3204789 in a democracy a legislator elected on a particular platform should return his mandate to the people and resign his seat before he switches sides that is what respect for the dignity of the voter means
3204790 they should have tried to convince him that it is more honourable to enter putrajaya through the front door this implies winning the 13th general election at the federal level and forming the government through legitimate ethical means
3204791 one hopes that he will also as the leader of the opposition establish a shadow cabinet that cajoles and coaxes the bn government to introduce much needed changes
3204792 this is what the people would want him to do anwar has no mandate to oust the democratically elected government of the day through the back door

3204850 in attack the full backs will take charge of the wing and the players used on the left of midfield will have to use space in the centre and barry would excel in that role liverpool also need english players as year after year clubs will be forced to reduce the number on non nationals

3205032 siguro ngayon hindi pa yon yung stage na kailangan ko pang gampanan na roles kasi nagpo portray pa naman kasi ako ng wholesome image e so siguro hindi pa talaga yon yung time para pumasok ako sa ganung roles
3205033 at siguro kung may guidance naman ni tita annabelle okay naman siguro kung ano ang sasabihin niya pero yon nga depende naman sa mapag uusapan e kasi siyempre may mga bagay na ayoko pang gawin ngayon

3205149 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3205150 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia and these actions would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began on august the 6th
3205151 now about he can do is bluster and hope for the best outcome while a fledgling democracy hangs in the balance
3205152 ustasa terrorists killed 500 000 serbs expelled 250 000 and forced 250 000 to convert to catholicism
3205153 re christen these degenerates in the name of god you follow my example
3205154 the orthodox of this district have only three ways out to accept the catholic faith to move out leaving behind them all their possessions or to be cleansed with the metal broom

3205156 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3205157 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3205158 there were blacks among the dead who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
3205159 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3205160 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3205161 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

3205163 know it all dinners are a competitive industry event with a difference
3205164 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3205165 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3205166 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3205167 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3205168 virtually all production has been shut down because of this
3205169 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it
3205170 pre planned cold blooded and pre meditated murder of a small country
3205171 no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3205172 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3205173 all that we have had from the international community is humanitarian aid which is starting to arrive and statements re georgia fighting rages in s ossetia russian tanks head for battle
3205174 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3205175 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3205176 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3205177 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3205178 russian and georgian forces must immediately cease hostilities throughout georgia and return to their august 6 positions
3205179 furthermore in escalating the conflict through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside south ossetia russia has ceased to act as a peacekeeper it is imperative that russia respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
3205180 military force will not resolve this dispute the only viable long term solution is international mediation and peacekeeping
3205181 we understand that we may face a massive money withdrawal so it seems logical to keep the assets in the banks
3205182 but we havent seen any kind of panic so far
3205183 much of the foreign money is invested in the infrastructure road railway and pipeline construction so it will be hard to withdraw
3205184 we try to export our wine and fruit to europe and the united states but they have very high standards so we would prefer russia
3205185 the situation in georgia highlights the greatly increased risks related to energy transits through the country
3205186 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3205187 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3205188 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3205189 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3205190 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3205191 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3205192 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
3205193 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
3205194 the russians have crossed the border and are now in control of zugdidi
3205195 we saw russian military trucks passing by we saw hundreds of soldiers there was a mix of soldiers from the regular army and soldiers that are supposed to be peacekeepers
3205196 is absolutely a war between russia and america the biggest mistake was in underestimating us now youll see what happens
3205197 the whole of south ossetia is in ruins the role of those who came here today is 100 per cent humanitarian they came to rebuild infrastructure
3205198 in the past two days about 2 000 people volunteered these are men with experience of military operations in hot spots
3205199 not one newspaper in the west has written the truth about whats happening here no one has written that the georgians were the ones who started this that they are the ones shooting women and children
3205200 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3205201 moved with care not to worsen relations with the us
3205202 the navy was ordered not to allow supplies of weapons and military hardware into georgia by sea
3205203 a blockade of the coast would mean that we were at war with georgia which we are not
3205204 the actions by the ukrainian side are contrary to ukrainian russian agreements and are hostile to the russian federation
3205205 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3205206 no one needs cold war with russia but this country has intruded into the territory of a sovereign state i was surprised at bushs embracing putin in the opening of the olympic games after that putin was sitting while bush and first lady were applauding the american team
3205207 putins next target will be ukraine but he can not do it there georgia has 5 million population and ukraine 50 million there are other factors too
3205208 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3205209 no one needs cold war with russia but this country has intruded into the territory of a sovereign state i was surprised at bushs embracing putin in the opening of the olympic games after that putin was sitting while bush and first lady were applauding the american team
3205210 putins next target will be ukraine but he can not do it there georgia has 5 million population and ukraine 50 million there are other factors too
3205211 today its georgia tomorrow its ukraine the day after tomorrow its latvia
3205212 russias aggression against georgia must be stopped with the help of coordinated actions of the international community immediately before all georgian infrastructure and economy is destroyed which would bring about humanitarian catastrophe with long term consequences in the entire region
3205213 justification of russias actions in georgia by the need to protect its citizens is unacceptable alleged reasons for taking up a war against georgia raise concerns about the future in every state with russian citizens living on its territory
3205214 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

3205228 geoff bardon a schoolteacher who helped start one of the most significant art movements of the 20th century has been described as the right man in the right place at the right time
3205229 my dad said whats a young man doing in a place like papunya
3205230 by the time bardon left papunya in mid 1972 the painting men had formed their own company and the revolutionary western desert art movement had begun but for bardon the personal cost was enormous bardon soon found himself at the center of a vitriolic character assassination engineered by the white population who thought the aborigines should be kept in their place

3205235 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3205236 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3205283 for too long he should say those cashing in and moving out of this state have enriched themselves and sold out future generations running up debts and enhancing their pensions pensions that most taxpayers dont get and then agreeing to lower wages and diminished benefits for those who come after he will not sign such a bill he should say unless it can be proven that those now retired have never voted for contracts that imposed lower pay and benefits on those hired after them
3205284 for too long he should say new yorkers have paid more and more taxes for fewer and fewer services because more and more money has been sucked out of our future by greed in our past through debts pensions deferred costs advanced revenues and infrastructure disinvestment he should demand a public vetting of how past public employee union contracts have benefited those hired at different times and demand that future contracts seek to offset the inequities

3205315 were not talking about a lot of oil its not like its going to have an impact on the price of gasoline right now its too little it wont get us off our foreign oil dependency and we cant even be sure how much oil is in the tanker its just not worth the effort
3205316 its free energy all we need to do is recover it i mean look its right there
3205317 we need renewable energy fetching that oil tanker is just going to be a waste of time and money

3205320 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3205321 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3205322 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3205323 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3205324 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
3205325 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3205326 russia made clear the goal of this operation is the regime change in georgia change of democratically elected government
3205327 it is quite clear what is happening we are in the process of an invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country

3205344 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3205345 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3205346 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3205347 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3205348 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3205349 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3205350 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3205351 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3205352 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3205391 many struggling gays and lesbians will find this blog an inspiration
3205392 hush and listen is a blog that ive been reading for quite some time now the author is passionate deep and poetic i love poetry so im drawn to his lugubrious yet beautiful prose his written imagery juxtaposed with intriguing visuals captivate me
3205393 nicely written nicely designed blog with lots of fantastic pictures which provoke your mind
3205394 what makes hush and listen so different is the level to which khalel the author appears to take his passion for writing into something far greater his words are terribly striking and any gay man is sure to be able to relate to at least one but more likely many of his pieces which he faithfully posts this is a definite must read for any gay man or for any poetic soul for that matter
3205395 hush and listen is a very unique blog the creator and author uses his creative mind and imaginative skills to write some very deep essays poems and words to read his talented imagery and photos that he uses not only excite my imagination but takes it to a whole new level when i add his words into the picture
3205396 its terrific the page is a treat to the eyes and hes khalel an expressive and poetic wordsmith definitely a blog worth getting to know
3205397 i am mesmerized i can hardly breathe while reading i have just been on the first page wait till i get on with the archive reading this blog makes me high
3205398 a very rivetting blogsite definitely a must visit website khalel the author is also in my contacts he also has a multiply site that is as equally as thought provoking and emotion weilding blogsite one of the best gay blogs i have ever seen
3205399 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump
3205400 will adam dunn ken griffey jr and josh hamilton some day do the same
3205401 i didnt know how to formulate expression it was very difficult but then you read hamlet and realise that this is a way of giving a voice to those things
3205402 no i dont think so i think it was more to do with being a teenager all teenagers have difficulty expressing themselves
3205403 put me in heels and i can sing stand by your man to a crowd of strangers put me in jeans and i cant even bloody well say hello
3205404 in terms of freedom of expression yeah they do but i guess thats like any art form when you look at yourself and make changes you are to some extent fulfilling a deep seated need but
3205405 its not for me to say what prompts that need
3205406 i remember getting cast in amistad and getting this very strong feeling that i had overshot myself it was a great shock it made me realise that this is not a profession you can predict that you can have all these ambitions and expectations and that they can all be thrown to the wind
3205407 what was peculiar about that situation was that my aspirations were so far below what actually happened
3205408 oh no way come on id just worked with steven spielberg that opens a lot of doors and of course the hardest thing as an actor is getting in the door once youre there you can do your magic tricks
3205409 well i dont know i suppose it depends what you mean by stardom and how you define success anyway
3205410 there are a lot of successful black actors in theatre
3205411 but there is still the constant possibility of change and in the time that ive been compos mentis since i was about 10 i think that the landscape has changed enormously and i think london is going to have many more opportunities to open up in the future but im not saying its ideal
3205412 i dont know if thats true its a crying shame if it is
3205413 i mean will smith is huge in japan so it cant be down to a simple case of race theres also the issue that i was not a household name maybe it was more to do with that
3205414 and then maybe race is the knockout punch oh and by the way hes also black not being a household name and being black
3205415 this is not about one or two institutions we are now working with the other players in the industry
3205416 we could have another 6 to 8 rally in the next few months as people start picking stocks that will do well in a lower oil environment
3205417 this is not a temporary drop in oil its going to be something thats a huge driver when you think about what it could mean for companies
3205418 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months
3205419 it reinforces the view that the economy will be weak in the next several months and there will be renewed pressure on the fed to start easing again
3205420 when the fed started to cut rates mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3205421 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be mistaken
3205422 when times are tough the herd starts running in the other direction with tougher standards pretty much across the board
3205423 large majorities of domestic respondents reported having tightened their lending standards on prime nontraditional and subprime residential mortgages over the previous three months
3205424 a second ballot was sent out to those voters with an explanation of why they got it telling them there was a typographical error on the ballot and that it was their option of ballot to return

3205452 i was falling over with my punches looking pretty sloppy i was supposed to go out there and take the lead i just felt like i was leaning over too much it just wasnt me out there this is not the last of me and everyone is going to know who i really am

3205455 in 1938 the property shows inside the city limits in 1983 the property shows inside the city limits but they say they arent in the city limits
3205456 so theyre inside the city limits for water because its cheaper but outside the city if they have to pay taxes
3205457 i say just shut their water off can you do that for back taxes
3205458 mark has said it will cost too much money and he recommends turning all our collections over to the county
3205459 i dont want to do that sheila has been doing a very good job
3205460 we cant hardly do that if we dont make them pay then nobody is going to pay anymore
3205461 rector liked going through the county thats how lebanon does it
3205462 they cant get their vehicle license if they dont pay their taxes to the county
3205463 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3205464 a few of these guys are going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3205465 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3205466 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3205467 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3205468 its non displaced which is good news as were looking at it now we dont think it will be too long after that two week period
3205469 whether its three weeks or a little bit sooner than that or a little bit later im not sure
3205470 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3205471 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3205472 i learned a lot from letterman and leno while living in the states
3205473 that was the first time chinese people as a whole stood up to the world
3205474 its good for chinese people that incident proves that when chinese are upset they can find their voice
3205475 no less jingoistic than those who have never gone abroad
3205476 a significant proportion of them believe that using force to promote chinas national interests is acceptable
3205477 it means the post 1989 policy to imbue youth with nationalism through patriotic education has succeeded
3205478 they felt the most important thing was to help chinese education they wanted to teach
3205479 people say dai qings stupid after 20 years of going overseas she doesnt even have a green card
3205480 to be honest when we go abroad we do find people asking strange questions like whether china has modern buildings or cars
3205481 sometimes its hard not to feel they have some bias
3205482 theyre being anti western to feel attached to their own country
3205483 as soon as they get online they can be totally immersed in a chinese environment
3205484 when we were studying abroad occasionally you went to chinatown to read a chinese paper now if youre in the u k you can easily not read english papers or watch english tv
3205485 young chinese feel they have the right to speak out about anything
3205486 this generation doesnt want to accept any ideological message whether its from the communist party or voice of america

3205518 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3205519 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3205520 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3205521 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3205522 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3205523 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3205524 the large whales the commercially important ones have for the most part responded well under protection
3205525 in the case of the minke whale its not that the stocks are more robust but there is more and better information

3205549 as a consequence the national security council has just decided to bring the georgian army to tbilisi in order to defend the capital and prevent the fall of georgia

3205551 russias goal is to put an end to existence of the georgian state

3205553 our armed forces will carry out regrouping and we will protect and continue fighting for our future we will never surrender we will never say no to freedom and our future we will never kneel down

3205582 this visit will open a new page in the relations between both countries
3205583 it will help to benefit both of these brotherly nations and will support the security of iraq and the region
3205584 we learned that many insurgents want to hand themselves over but because of the raids and operations they feared they might be killed
3205585 so the prime minister made this decision to encourage them to stop fighting
3205586 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then can peace come

3205588 im just not sure the military progress can be translated into political progress
3205589 my wife is on edge from the moment i leave home until the moment i return
3205590 all these things need to be stopped the government needs to take action against the perpetrators
3205591 people are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now

3205601 the way ive been looking at it at the moment is i cant control whether the club wants me for next year or whether they dont
3205602 all i can do is try to get myself fit
3205603 as i said its been unfortunate that ive had a few injuries but the rest of my body feels really good and i certainly want to play on next year so ill leave that in the hands of the club
3205604 i certainly do think that another pre season would do me the world of good i still think that i can play at this level if i didnt think that i would certainly hang up the boots
3205605 but i think i can still play at this level and its just a matter of getting the body right
3205606 the games too hard to be playing when youre just not fit and youve got injuries
3205607 ive never celebrated that much after a race in my life
3205608 its out of the way now and im just swimming to have fun

3205612 im concerned that this figure of 100 000 job losses is on top of the treasury prediction in may
3205613 i have asked the government repeatedly to explain why it predicted 134 000 job losses
3205614 this is very serious this is about peoples jobs peoples livelihoods and the government must come clean and indicate where why and which areas of the economy there are going to be job losses
3205615 the reserve bank was put in an impossible position last year by the incoming rudd government
3205616 it had inherited the best economic conditions of any incoming federal government in our history yet both kevin rudd and wayne swan went overboard in their rush to blacken the economic credentials of the howard government
3205617 in fact business and consumer confidence remained strong through the asian economic crisis
3205618 even post september 11 when the world thought it was on the brink of some catastrophic outcome business and consumer confidence dropped but came back up again because people had confidence in the leadership of the country to steer them through these difficult international times
3205619 businesses are all aware of employment minister julia gillards attacks on employers

3205698 the texas heavyweight texas junior and texas tag team champions will now be state champions not in name but because theyll be traveling champions going into other regions of the state defending their belt
3205699 we anticipate nwa southwest action will impact fans who also reside outside the regions to come to the region closest to them to see title matches and our nwa wrestling showcases featuring such famous and veteran stalwarts as sid vicious blue demon rob conway x pac to name just a few
3205700 the old guard of promoters did not want over exposure other than their own television production but when wwf now wwe went cable that changed everything forever and coupled with the emerging internet age and tape sales the ability to kayfabe was no longer a controlled situation
3205701 times have changed drastically in the way of doing business which is to communicate effectively between wrestling dates to build up excitement and enhance brand
3205702 the old guard was excellent in working the system back then and it resulted in sell out shows everywhere especially true in the 60s and 70s
3205703 nwa southwest has raised the bar higher aspiring both fans and talents to be able to participate in state and world title matches of 60 years legitimacy
3205704 we will begin the process immediately of positioning the best talent in each region against the best in other regions and then give all involved a real opportunity to shine and compete for state national and world levels of competition
3205705 the best of the best will become champions and from there will come opportunities for vie for north american and world gold
3205706 a web site is a powerful tool executed professionally and correctly as it can build a huge and loyal new generation of fans to nwa
3205707 from the standpoint of communicating we have media technology far superior to anything the old territory had available our mission statement is simple create a new generation of nwa fans in texas and oklahoma by creating a total wrestling package we realize delivering a depth of quality stars is as important as creating strong media coverage and we see our talent level arguably close to the old stars that many will come to realize

3205711 a number of the pieces have clay stamps that indicate quality control like when you buy a shirt and it says inspected by no 7 no 7 was working in 220 b c
3205712 our culture is based on the individual this culture has been based on the group ethos which is manifestly evident here
3205713 i dont mind being a hockey mom at all but i have seen the price tag on a few of the items someone said hes going to be moving into adult sizes and youre not going to want to be buying skates and items such as that all right i need another job
3205714 ill find something to do but the nice thing is i dont have to figure that out tomorrow or the next day i can take my time
3205715 it took a lot more time healing then i hoped disappointed would be an understatement
3205716 ive had a lot of time to think about a lot of things and moving on is one of them ive had lots of great fun out there gosh played lots of great golf courses here and across the states met lots of super people twenty five years
3205717 shes done a lot for canadian golf shes always been someone everybody looked up to its unfortunate shes retiring and its too bad shes been injured and hasnt been able to play out the whole year shes going to be missed
3205718 we looked up to sandra post and jocelyne bourassa and knew there was an avenue there was a way to get out here and be a pro
3205719 now youre seeing alena and some of the other gals come up
3205720 if i inspired anybody to get out there and work hard then i feel good about that

3205723 definitely going 47 56 when i was hoping to break 48 seconds is a really good indication of what im going to be able to do
3205724 i think to go from that and beat the americans was pretty much impossible but were on the right track and were still building on it
3205725 i think it was a really good decision and i dont think i could have gone a 47 56 if id done the 200 this morning
3205726 it came down to sacrificing my individual performance for the good of the team
3205727 i think its looking really good we have a really good medal shot in the 4x200 especially with me and colin going 1 46s sunday in the 200 freestyle i think we were only the second team to have two guys make the semifinal
3205728 i think you can twist anything around as a positive all these things are great things that we are building on i think the team has the ability to win medals i would be disappointed if it didnt but it wouldnt be a deal breaker i can tell you that all the other countries are going wow you guys are awesome its amazing what youre doing i think within the swimming world we feel like weve moved a giant step
3205729 we will be really happy with a lot of finals and if we get medals with it then great

3205737 standard pizza made with fresh mozzarella a san marzano tomato sauce and topped with romano and fresh basil and we were pleasantly full but not stuffed it did cost 25 with tip though also be warned they dont do slices i tried coming here for lunch yesterday but i didnt have time to wait for a whole pizza so i went across the street to pomodoro i gave both of them 4 stars because theyre both very good and represent some of the best pizza in new york but theyre very different styles so i recommend trying both if you really want a taste of little italy for a californian this is simply the best ny pizza ive ever had the ingredients were fresh the sausage was actually carved out instead of ball shaped ones you get out here considering ny pizza is my favorite style i was in heaven for the duration of the 2 slices we went for lunch and got seated right away the waitress was friendly and informative the only complaint i have is i didnt order enough for satisfaction 06 30 2008 theres pretty good thin crust pizza to be had at lombardis but really i only went there because its an institution in manhattan my friend said her ex boyfriend would drive from queens just to have it but honestly i wouldnt go that far for it its fine but not transcendant the sauce cheese and crust nothing was particularly remarkable in either a good or bad way maybe thats what happens after 100 years in business the restaurant is maze like i think we actually passed through the kitchen to get to the annexed dining room where we ate the wines by the glass are passable i found it odd that they served sangria but whatever overall not as impressive as i would have hoped but fine enough jan 2007 you would think after having pizza twice in a day courtesy of greenwich village food tour that we would be all pizzad out but we just could not resist eating at the famous lombardis pizza want more than 1 kind of pizza but not necessary having to order more than 1 request to have them do half and half my boyfriend and i order one pizza with half being the classic margherita and the other half their famous white sauce pizza i was not a big fan of the white sauce pizza but the margherita was pizza at its best i consulted many tour books on the subject and they all gave it bad reviews so i knew it would be bad yelpers why did you give it 4 stars only reason i went here was because of friends my one trip to new york and i had to experience bad pizza i wanted to go to brooklyn plus the wait was long and the maitred took us off the list because we were outside since it was so crowded inside then he put us at the bottom of the list again it was only after this woman who worked there saw how pissed off we were that she put us at the top of the list again sadly bella pizza near my house is a lot better and i live in frisco historical pizza place with lots of locals and looking satisfied and having fun primo ingredients and delicious pizza with perfect thin crispy yet chewy crust check out the back where they bake the pizza in the big red hot fire oven its like a pizza factory and the chefs have it down to a rhythmic science dont bother going all the way into little italy for a great slice or pie this place borders east soho and has lots of nice little shops and other restaurants without the herds of people like on mulberry or broadway so i went after looking at all the guide books reading reviews here on yelp and asking folks on the street dont know how i never realized that they dont do pizza by the slice so i ended up ordering an entire 14

3205741 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3205742 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3205743 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3205744 does highlight a trend with other studies linking shortages of vitamin d to increased rates of breast cancer and depression in the elderly
3205745 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3205746 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3205747 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3205748 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3205755 im concerned that this figure of 100 000 job losses is on top of the treasury prediction in may
3205756 i have asked the government repeatedly to explain why it predicted 134 000 job losses
3205757 this is very serious this is about peoples jobs peoples livelihoods and the government must come clean and indicate where why and which areas of the economy there are going to be job losses
3205758 the reserve bank was put in an impossible position last year by the incoming rudd government
3205759 it had inherited the best economic conditions of any incoming federal government in our history yet both kevin rudd and wayne swan went overboard in their rush to blacken the economic credentials of the howard government
3205760 in fact business and consumer confidence remained strong through the asian economic crisis
3205761 even post september 11 when the world thought it was on the brink of some catastrophic outcome business and consumer confidence dropped but came back up again because people had confidence in the leadership of the country to steer them through these difficult international times

3205764 if russia is allowed to follow through on a doctrine of issuing passports to residents of an adjacent country aiding the secessionists in their provocation of that country intervening on their behalf destroying the military infrastructure of that country annexing those territories and achieving regime change in the subject country and getting away with it well those are some terrible precedents for all who live on its borders to deal with

3205782 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3205783 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3205784 for the last forty years our thought has been trapped in hollow structures of language a stale dead but immensely successful rhetoric this has represented in my view a defeat of the intelligence and of the will
3205785 fell short of the categorical retraction of the imputation of anti semitism that i insisted upon
3205786 playing arsenal will be a great experience for the players and if they dont become better players after playing against arsenal they shouldnt be in football
3205787 thats how you learn thats how you grow and playing against one of the best teams in europe obviously the players will grow from that
3205788 i know what i am who i am and the most important people to me are those around me those ive worked with
3205789 people have called me up to say we admire you because of the gamble youve taken i dont see it like that i see it as a challenge although ive had success and ive managed
3205790 i believe cesc will be ready for wednesday he has worked very hard since he came back
3205791 you cannot say he will be at his best but he will be fit enough
3205792 to win big trophies makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you
3205793 at 21 he already has a lot of experience he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him
3205794 we know every single player in his area is very important cesc in midfield is a player now who has maybe more experience than the others
3205795 my life is pretty much packed into my racquet bag
3205796 having an extra day off friday you can plan to have things you need to do
3205797 otherwise youd have to take off and use a sick day or vacation and you dont have to do that
3205798 with the rate of employment growth expected to remain below that of the working age population the unemployment rate is expected to rise
3205799 it can generate up to 60 percent of the electrical energy usage of the house and i guess the better question isnt why do we offer it as much as why dont other people offer it
3205800 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3205801 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3205802 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3205803 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3205804 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3205805 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3205806 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3205807 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3205808 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3205809 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3205810 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3205811 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3205812 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3205813 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3205814 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3205815 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3205816 not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3205817 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3205818 a few of these guys is going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3205819 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3205820 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3205821 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3205822 its non displaced which is good news as were looking at it now we dont think it will be too long after that two week period
3205823 whether its three weeks or a little bit sooner than that or a little bit later im not sure
3205824 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3205825 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3205826 if the grain gets stirred up the dust can get really explosive
3205827 its devoted toward having people aware of the knowledge that their faculties are diminishing
3205828 in recognition of that weve set forth in the program ways to compensate for that
3205829 like taking more time being more realistic about driving and not chit chatting while youre driving
3205830 its extremely important in the sense that a lot of times older drivers fall into the same bad habits as younger drivers but our seniors have reduced reaction time
3205831 the assignment at the end of the first day is to turn to page 100 and it asks people to think in terms of what can they do about being mobile without driving what are the resources available in their community
3205832 agfeed has direct access to the wealthiest pork consumer markets in china and captures some of the highest hog selling prices
3205833 we anticipate continued rapid expansion in these key consumer regions and expect to deliver strong financial results in our third and fourth quarters
3205834 commodity prices in 2009 are poised to further surpass historical averages
3205835 i have some bad news for you you only have three months to live
3205836 n o muito importante saber se uma empresa teve lucro ou preju zo em determinado exerc cio pois o resultado pode ter sido maquilado por algum artif cio cont bil permitido pela lei e portanto sem conhecer o fluxo de caixa n o se pode saber que capacidade a empresa tem em gerar receita
3205837 sempre bom lembrar que as empresas quebram n o por falta de lucro e sim por falta de caixa
3205838 i was a big fast food eater my body was young i could fake it i was at papa johns every other night eating like i was still in college now ive got to be a little bit smarter with my body
3205839 i had to force myself to run i had no strength there coming in refreshed even missing nine games last year kind of helped me out because it let me breathe a little bit now im ready to get rolling again
3205840 everybody was frustrated it was tough to sit from the sideline cheering trying to light my team up without being out there
3205841 i always believe that ive got to win the game
3205842 because when things dont work out he gets mad at himself then he loses sight of thats one play one series let it go hes a very conscientious guy with certain goals thats a good thing but sometimes it could be bad theres a lot of pressure on him
3205843 he loses michael turner itll be interesting to see what he does without that second guy coming in for him
3205844 hes right handed which im kind of bummed about were trying to get him to be a lefty
3205845 ive been through a lot the last six months the last year and its helped me
3205846 it was tough to deal with it was something you just learn from
3205847 i was disappointed for my family for my son but you can let it destroy your life or you can move on and just roll with it
3205848 i know my teammates have my back and even my coaches they all saw how hard i was working
3205849 im out to prove im going to be a winner that i can get this team to the next level
3205850 as the starter your responsibilities are greater sometimes youre like its unfair i cant go out and be a normal person without someone constantly taking a picture
3205851 the next thing you know its on the internet and hes wasted
3205852 those are things you have to be aware of those are sacrifices im willing to make
3205853 im really not so sure his first two years this position was that important to him
3205854 i didnt sense an anger a work ethic things you have to have i sense matt now has a sense of urgency about this game
3205855 kurts been doing it a long time so he anticipates things because hes a veteran player matt is starting to get to that point
3205856 were very fortunate we have two quarterbacks who can play
3205857 i really believe we both deserve to have the opportunity to start
3205858 it would be so nice to just be somewhere else where i could just play
3205859 ive thought about it but i dont want to go anywhere else

3205861 we tried to count the number of mountain ranges we had crossed and figure the mileage we had made and then we gave it up it did not matter it was made
3205862 if youve heard of gears or browserplus chances are youve heard them positioned as competitors in one way or another another google vs yahoo showdown truth is thats not the case at all or at least doesnt have to be after taking a look at what these technologies actually offer we can see that theyre actually two distinct approaches to an exciting new direction for the web
3205863 we were there for maybe 6 or 7 hours from about 9 am to 4 pm and we easily did everything that we wanted to do the attractions that were there tended towards the boring side while they were all transplants from america they were mostly the snoozers
3205864 the price is very expensive i saved myself hk 400 us 51 and my family still had a great time
3205865 i think disneyland is too expensive and it isnt worth it at all it doesnt have many rides interesting things to see and the quality of service is not really that good and the food is not that great
3205866 if you havent grown up with the brand its characters and themes you are not quite sure what you are walking into
3205867 we are working hard to learn what the chinese want
3205868 the fantasy garden in fantasyland is the first of its kind among the disney theme parks in the world tailoring to the love of local and regional guests for photo taking
3205869 splash mountain was missing my personal favorite from the american park
3205870 space mountain was there but that may be the only real
3205871 hong kong disneyland has received well over 10 million guests since its opening in september 2005 and has become one of the most visited theme parks in the world as well as a top attraction in hong kong
3205872 i think most parks in the world would be thrilled to achieve 5 2 million people their first year
3205873 obviously it was below their expectations but from the context of how parks in the world do it was actually a pretty good year for them
3205874 we basically focus on connecting people with nature the basis of our differential is our animal based attractions our focus on education conservation and entertainment so at the end of the day were quite a complement to disney i dont look at it as competition
3205875 the opening of hong kong disneyland has led to a synergy effect where parks in the pearl river delta region ocean park windows of the world happy valley amp china folk culture villages in shenzhen have seen their attendances maintained or increased
3205876 its very regrettable that hong kong people have spent billions of dollars to import this brand name and it turned out a big failure
3205877 i dont think we should pour more money into it
3205878 we are adding special events to target the young adult market introducing flexible ticketing arrangement to offer guests more choice and convenience and establishing rapport with the local travel trade

3205883 little logan was having 100 to 200 seizures a day
3205884 there were a lot of risks one of which that he may not make it
3205885 last week when he went to see the neurologist the neurologist looked at his mom in awe and said this is not the little boy i operated on
3205886 and he also told her logan has an awesome future ahead
3205887 i think the same spirit prayer warriors that were praying for jessie were praying for logan
3205888 the republicans should have nominated him in 2000 when he was still sane
3205889 theres no doubt in my mind that we will prevail and theres no doubt in my mind once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
3205890 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues

3205896 in many cases youre dealing with public healthcare facilities where they would be looking at a significant impact and that would mean they would have to be addressing some cuts that in turn would mean less services for people and higher costs
3205897 taxing people in this state has to be a last resort were losing heavy population and people from having done that in the past
3205898 we have always said to any candidate dont take our endorsement for granted its all about not only the long term relationship that we have with people but also what happens even in the short run

3205902 every nation has to be either for us or against us those who harbor terrorists or who finance them are going to pay a price
3205903 a man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car but if he has a university education he may steal the whole railroad
3205904 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3205905 he who controls the money supply of a nation controls the nation
3205906 because power corrupts societys demands for moral authority and character increase as the importance of the position increases
3205907 that government is best which governs the least because its people discipline themselves
3205908 those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it
3205909 there is nothing more corrupting nothing more destructive of the noblest and finest feelings of our nature than the exercise of unlimited power
3205910 a government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have
3205911 government always finds a need for whatever money it gets
3205912 there is no dignity quite so impressive and no independence quite so important as living within your means
3205913 blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt
3205914 collecting more taxes than is absolutely necessary is legalized robbery
3205915 there is more selfishness and less principle among members of congress than i had any conception of before i became president of the u s
3205916 we live in a stage of politics where legislators seem to regard the passage of laws as much more important than the results of their enforcement
3205917 always vote for principle though you may vote alone and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost
3205918 any man worth his salt will stick up for what he believes right but it takes a slightly better man to acknowledge instantly and without reservation that he is in error
3205919 hold fast to the bible to the influence of this book we are indebted for all the progress made in true civilization and to this we must look as our guide in the future
3205920 a thorough knowledge of the bible is worth more than a college education
3205921 an intellectual is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows
3205922 at that particular stage you cant row for a position and hope you might pick someone else up
3205923 it wasnt a difficult choice to make coming here everyone in the papers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here
3205924 as soon as i knew they were interested i said
3205925 i came here because the manager has wanted me for two years i met him two years ago when i was at auxerre and i like the man because he gives you confidence
3205926 its a good opportunity for me because the club has a lot of ambition
3205927 i think pompey are a top five premier league side and i believe i can achieve what i want to achieve at this club
3205928 run down neglected and the nfls poorest facility for athletes and spectators alike
3205929 when i was laying there on the field thats the most scared ive ever been
3205930 laying there for about a minute i couldnt feel my left side after the trainers came out about 30 seconds later i could start to get the feeling back its something i dont want to experience again
3205931 it was the first chance i had to do any contact since december of 06 so i was just real pumped up and i was the first one down there
3205932 i ran into the guy and the next thing i know im laying on my side and i couldnt move my left side thats basically it i hit him pretty hard i had to pick the biggest guy too
3205933 my mom was watching the arizona cardinals game and she saw my name go across the bottom line that i got carried off on a stretcher so she was freaking out

3205940 it would absolutely suck if you paid a few bucks for a book only to find that on the first page it said once upon a time they all lived happily ever after and the rest of the book was blank
3205941 if you want a happy ending that depends of course on where you stop your story
3205942 why dont you let me tell you whats going on

3205958 this is new zealands oldest fossil and it has implications for the origin of modern seabirds
3205959 airline fares are rocketing upward along with higher fuel prices
3205960 and so are government taxes yet even if you cancel the ticket you still get stuck with the tax and if you change your flight you get hit again
3205961 anyone who looks at the cost breakdown when they buy a ticket will see a federal excise tax a security fee and airport charges they make even a cheap ticket expensive for many families
3205962 and its not obvious that we get good value for our money ask yourself how safe you feel the next time you are standing in an airport security line and the tsa employees confiscate someones bottle of water
3205963 even more outrageous though the government keeps your money even if you change your ticket
3205964 at least the airlines give you credit minus a hefty change fee of course but the federal government just pockets the money when asked about this unfair practice government employees say thats just the way the regulations are written regulations that they of course wrote
3205965 the airport taxes might be small change compared to the federal income tax but they exemplify how the government cares more about collecting money than treating taxpayers fairly that will change in a barr administration
3205966 one of the priorities of my administration will be to sharply cut and significantly simplify federal taxes we pay too much and spend too much time figuring out how much we have to pay that needs to change
3205967 lowering and simplifying taxes will make all of us better off and make our country both freer and more prosperous
3205968 i will also ensure that the american people stop paying taxes on services that they dont receive like airline travel we dont let businesses get away with charging us for services that they dont perform we should hold government to the same standard as president barr will do

3205971 we typically make fun of bungled police operations by saying they were conducted by the gang that couldnt shoot straight
3205972 in this case they could shoot straight as a result they killed a familys two dogs in the midst of a misguided drug raid
3205973 rather than carefully checking the facts including talking to the local police department the county authorities acted rashly illustrating how the drug war threatens the liberties of all americans
3205974 absent exigent circumstances not present here so called no knock raids are an affront to the constitution
3205975 so is a shoot first ask questions later philosophy by the police yet the prince georges police have done this before last fall they invaded a house at the wrong address and shot the family dog all americans are at risk when the police behave this way just ask yourself what might happen if a suspicious package is delivered to your home and the cops bust in
3205976 but there is an even larger point law enforcement agencies have become more arrogant and less accountable in cases other than those involving drugs most people are aware of well publicized examples like waco and ruby ridge but similar abuses are common across the country though they usually receive little or no public notice
3205977 we all want police to do their jobs well but part of doing their job well is respecting the peoples constitutional liberties
3205978 as president i will ensure that federal law enforcement agencies set a good example for the rest of the country
3205979 in a barr administration government officials will never forget that it is a free people they are protecting
3205980 george washington long ago warned america against entangling alliances and he was right
3205981 russia and georgia risk falling into a full scale war in which the u s can and hopefully will avoid any involvement but had georgia been a member of nato we would now be risking a full scale confrontation with nuclear armed russia
3205982 obviously america should encourage both countries to back down and resolve their differences peacefully
3205983 the status of south ossetia as well as abkhazia another russian supported separatist zone within georgia matters a lot more to russia on which the two territories border than to the u s moreover washington itself set a precedent for russia when it intervened in kosovo a decade ago attacking serbia to win independence for the separatist ethnic albanian majority
3205984 we should not create or expand alliances where the u s does not have vital interests if the europeans want to defend distant countries like georgia they can do so after all the european union has a larger population and bigger gdp than america without any of washingtons other global military commitments it is time for europe to accept responsibility for its own security
3205985 any war is tragic but not every war requires american intervention
3205986 we can do our best to mediate between russia and georgia but we should avoid any military involvement it is time to put the defense of america back into americas defense policy
3205987 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3205988 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3205989 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3205990 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3205991 i never thought id say this but van helsing was better than this
3205992 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag
3205993 every morning it was raised and reminded me of what a great nation i come from i hope this flag also brings you and your class the joy and contentment it has brought me
3205994 i understand this is your birthday weve come to celebrate
3205995 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today
3205996 will the insurgents have a less receptive hiding place will ieds become less frequent will the children of this town be more likely to have a future with less hatred
3205997 use your cancer to learn and grow and as a force to work for you
3205998 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3205999 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3206000 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3206001 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3206002 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3206003 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3206004 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3206005 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3206006 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3206007 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3206008 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3206009 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3206010 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3206011 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3206012 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3206013 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3206014 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3206015 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3206016 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3206017 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3206018 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3206019 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3206020 to spooks what torchwood is to doctor who ie not as good
3206021 now with single stream recycling all of those materials will be collected into one bin
3206022 you have to make some changes in your plant operation to handle the single stream processing is different than processing what we call co mingle or source separated material where cardboard comes in separate plastic comes in separate so you have to get the plant and collection geared up so it takes some time
3206023 human nature is we look for the path of least resistance whatever is the easiest and less painful on us is the path we are going to go and single stream recycling definitely makes it easier on the consumer to separate their recycling material
3206024 well mr johnson i can totally relate to you being upset about the late delivery i will make sure that it doesnt happen again now about your other concerns this shows them you are not defensive about the situation and you are not interested in making excuses but solving the problem
3206025 i am talking to lawyers to figure out how to make our way ahead we have to decide what to do whether to file an appeal or file a separate public interest litigation pil before the supreme court as the issue concerns women and families all over india he said
3206026 grave abnormalities said a couple of people with children who were born with severe deformities as the foetal malformations were detected late have come forward to join him in the legal fight
3206027 there is one woman from kolkata who called me and said she was eager to chip in
3206028 we usually advise sonography for pregnant women in the 18 19th week
3206029 born alive living for no more than a few hours usually the foetus does not survive the procedure say experts
3206030 if you see the chance to get something get it
3206031 their skin is a different color therefore they are less trustworthy
3206032 we are pursuing it with all the energy we can
3206033 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3206034 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3206035 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3206036 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3206037 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3206038 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3206039 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government

3206280 if you look at what were doing in terms of medical research if you look at research and development the synchrotron bio21 the national stem cell centre innovation is very much the heart of our new economy and its a major driver of jobs into the future

3206283 they are also more inclined to reinvest the profits back in the business which is a great help
3206284 most family businesses are operating around broad unwritten family goals under leadership from the first generation founder this is not always the most profitable way of operating and can lead to problems down the track around leadership succession
3206285 a lot of these business leaders are strong personalities and strong entrepreneurs and their planning is done on the move so step one is what is the plan and what skills do i need around the table
3206286 when consumer sentiment trends down men stop spending while women continue to buy clothing for themselves and their kids
3206287 so while fashion spending is down the womens wear and childrens wear segments will prove relatively resilient
3206288 sales in infant and childrens wear are still decreasing but these sectors will survive todays difficult conditions reasonably well many parents of young kids have become accustomed to a certain level of spending and to years of prosperity and strong disposable incomes and theyre reluctant to give it up the current birth rate the highest level in more than 30 years will also help the sector presenting an opportunity for upmarket infants and childrens clothing retailers to tap into a small but lucrative market
3206289 the primary reason for this is that high income households though feeling interest rate pain still have the capacity to continue to spend we believe in many areas that consumer uncertainty is postponing retail sales rather than cancelling them altogether
3206290 if the next official interest rate movement is down we forecast a pronounced bounce back in consumer sentiment which will lead to a mild rise in retail sales for the first quarter of 2009 which should bode well for the fashion industry
3206291 close proximity to the local market is critical for industry players with frequent production runs geared at providing quick responses to fashion trends therefore the decision to retain local manufacturing operations will most likely be confined to designers supplying high quality niche markets only
3206292 manufacturing clothes is increasingly considered the domain either of developing countries with an abundance of cheap labour or of countries at the centre of the global fashion industry such as italy and france as clothing begins to more closely resemble a commodity product industrialised nations such as australia may phase out domestic production almost completely to focus on service sectors such as communications and finance
3206293 competition from imports and less than desirable production speeds are also threatening the local industry chinese imports currently represent about 62 of all clothing imports into australia and many local manufacturers are already struggling to make a crust in an industry where turnover has dived steeply in the wake of a shrinking manufacturing base rising imports and a saturated domestic market
3206294 yet our distance from major overseas markets restricts flexibility in both design and production leading to sluggish response times to international trends
3206295 when further tariff reductions come into play in 2010 ibisworld expects additional imports from vietnam and india will penetrate the australian apparel market giving china more of a run for its money
3206296 while the big spenders are less affected by a dampening economy the designer end of australias fashion industry is already saturated with well known local and international brands this will make for intense competition not of the margin destroying variety but fierce rivalry in terms of marketing and positioning for market share and future growth
3206297 independent operators should continually look to increase efficiencies within their business ensure branding and marketing is effective and stock items that will remain in demand smaller players that successfully differentiate themselves and attack key niche segments have the potential to make strong financial gains
3206298 come follow our path see what great things we have on our path here your path is dull and boring but well fill you with the excitement you need

3206317 jenis alatnya pun umumnya ada dua macam yaitu chasis dynamometer dan engine dynamometer dimana perbedaannya adalah kalau engine dynamometer itu mesinnya yang langsung kita taro di alat sedangkan kalo yang chasis dynamometer mobilnya roda yang kita taro di alat
3206318 jadi untuk mengukurnya beban roda yang ada di roller dyno diputar dengan sekian putaran rpm dengan waktu tertentu tentu kalo dihitung hitung akan keluar horsepower karena kita ukur melalui roda akurasi horsepower dari mesin bagaimana disitulah dia secara computerize akan menghitung kembali kehilangan kehilangan lostnya dimana beban rodapun dia kalkulasi sendiri dengan kehilangan kehilangan yang ada seperti ditransmisi dan setelah itu dia keluarin deh hasil horsepower akhirnya hasilnya tentu terbilang akurat dimana chassis dynamometer ini selain sudah dikalibrasi juga dilengkapi dengan weather station barometrik pressure untuk mengukur berapa temperatur cuaca yang bisa mempengaruhi hasil mesin
3206319 kalo untuk kontes modifikasi apalagi di abt ini fungsi dyno test tentunya untuk menentukan hasil itungan akurat modifikasi mesin itu memang bener atau tidak jangan cuman luar yang ditempel tempel kan kalo sekarang ditempel tempel saja yang penting mobil hidup ada yang pake turbo gede tapi belum tentu dia pake turbo gede hasilnya akan bagus jadi tidak hanya mengandalkan tampilan luar saja performa sebenarnya juga harus dihitung ya dengan dyno test ini

3206360 it is no surprise this is happening as returns on land are generally equal to or higher than returns on bricks and mortar and come with a much lower entry level price indeed land prices in natal are forecast to go up by 15 25 per annum based on current market trends
3206361 there is plenty of cheap land available in brazil some in the middle of nowhere that is being marketed as a good investment several of these plots are classed as rustic land not buildable at present and consequently do not have utilities power and water and infrastructure roads
3206362 purchases in such land should be considered as high risk and purely speculative on the basis that one day they might get urbanised and the promoter might actually implement the infrastructure required
3206363 which is why the land is marketed cheaply by european standards even with the very healthy margins build into the sales price
3206364 the location of plots and property is critical to maximising the investment potential
3206365 infrastructure services such as power and water have already been installed and the roads will be complete within the next three six months

3206498 social networks represent a classic risk reward proposition because customers partners investors employees and other stakeholders have the unprecedented ability to influence each others opinions about products and services
3206499 they quickly find each other according to very specific interests and communicate in social networks about companies and products that inspire or disappoint this represents a loss of control and a potential gain in influence for our clients
3206500 we find that early adopter marketers and social media executives now have experimental pockets of activity in numerous venues but they struggle to show value and get mindshare with other executives
3206501 they will benefit significantly by using the roadmaps structured approach which can help them to mature their programs and increase credibility and budgets
3206502 our approach is breakthrough because its a practical method for harnessing internal and external information now in a way that doesnt compromise intellectual property or security
3206503 the secret is optimizing internal and external information so that you align company and people goals paradoxically when enterprises embrace employees freewheeling desires to connect and communicate everywhere they gain more secure and productive workers and companies with the most connected workers win
3206504 whether its a death sentence or a life sentence at the moment we are glad that there has been a resolution

3206510 do you know what the bible says about how a person can go to heaven
3206511 we heard the commotion down here after the budget truck and next thing we know this trolley just careening out of control we were just enjoying a nice lunch and next thing you know it just demolished this van
3206512 just trying to avoid pedestrians and find someplace to hot or stop this trolley
3206513 unfortunately he hit this van and there was a person in the back
3206514 instinct took over i ran over and grabbed the guy out of the back of the van and set him down he had several lacerations and looked pretty much out of it we tied a tourniquet around his hand and then we went in to get the guy out of the trolley
3206515 senator stevens must be able to campaign albeit limitedly during the trial
3206516 unfortunately no matter the outcome of this trial this schedule alone may not be enough to ensure that senator stevens has the ability to compete meaningfully in the upcoming election
3206517 it is the first time in my life ive asked for a speedy trial
3206518 there are no plea offers at this time just to be clear

3206528 thats a guy who actually stalks me on the web and once stalked me personally
3206529 here is the underlying reality a nation that uses one quarter of the worlds oil while possessing less than 3 percent of its reserves cannot drill its way to happiness at the pump much less self sufficiency
3206530 we need to explore and develop offshore and elsewhere because our reserves are low if our reserves were very high we would not need to drill in new areas
3206531 it didnt happen by danish politicians making their people stupid by telling them the solution was simply more offshore drilling
3206532 no im too big fib hoping hell just accept it ill just watch

3206545 but as we become bigger and bigger and bigger it becomes a much larger thing
3206546 a huge policy area for us that causes a lot of conflicts and a lot of complaints and a lot of complicated ethical concerns
3206547 we want the demon you see to extract from the dance of atoms only information that is genuine like mathematical theorems fashion magazines blueprints historical chronicles or a recipe for ion crumpets or how to clean and iron a suit of asbestos and poetry too and scientific advice and almanacs and calendars and secret documents and everything that ever appeared in any newspaper in the universe and telephone books of the future

3206552 the truth is that there is no official release date for starcraft ii the game will ship when its done and not a moment sooner
3206553 originally i think that was all left to common sense
3206554 it is really sad but its necessary in the culture in which were living
3206555 offenses ranging from murder to rape to registered sex offenders
3206556 when youre trying to protect children and thats what its all about you need to be very specific and thats what this document does
3206557 i think its a good thing to spell it out because when we relied on common sense some people didnt have it
3206558 we still wish there was some measure of accountability for the people who perpetrated crimes in the past
3206559 until these priests are brought to justice we dont think there can ever be justice for anybody in the future
3206560 that only kicks them out of the catholic church it keeps them away from catholic kids
3206561 what about the kids that are on a playground not at a catholic school or at a city park
3206562 we dont know where these guys are and they the archdiocese wont tell us
3206563 we are as current as we know how to be as tough as we know how to be right now
3206564 no policy in itself can prevent bad things from happening there are laws covering all kinds of the things in the united states and laws get broken
3206565 only two or three priests have been accused of improper action during that time
3206566 unfortunately several lay people as well but we do think the decree has made a difference
3206567 there was advice that we received from the security consultants that it might be better not to start the competition from the 11th and move to the 12th
3206568 it is a strong possibility that we will reduce the champions trophy to two venues but the event will be played in pakistan
3206569 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3206570 it shows us that people are still willing to travel still willing to seek the vacation
3206571 weve been so committed to this guy were spending our energy pitching coach john farrell and i spent a bunch of time with him today trying to help theres a fine line there between giving a kid too much
3206572 last year when he was pitching against baltimore it looked so easy
3206573 right now its not easy youre playing good major league teams and theyre finding ways theyre doing everything in their power to try to find a way to exploit anything you do were kind of trying to balance trying to help and not beating him over the head with stuff thats actually not the easiest thing but were spending some time talking to him about things and just trying to make progress
3206574 hes trying hard to do the right thing its experience hes living through it we were laughing about it today buch youre experiencing everything thats just part of it
3206575 carls been one of our best clutch hitters recently specifically and theres everything else he brings his defense his speed in the outfield and on the bases his leadership all that stuff is going to be missed
3206576 its unrealistic for us to count on him on a daily basis
3206577 obviously carl is a premiere defensive left fielder in baseball
3206578 and with ruggiano we will feel he will at least help feed into that a little bit
3206579 as i said he probably didnt need this long but where we were at the time he basically agreed to go on because our situation at the time he was hurt but we probably could have had him back a couple of days ago
3206580 obviously if i had it my way id be back throwing right now it is taking a little bit longer than originally expected but were trying everything we can to get it healthy
3206581 its not 100 percent by any means were battling through some stuff and theres some discomfort but thats part of it i just have to accept that and work through it
3206582 its a small muscle the subscapularis muscle right underneath my arm
3206583 when i go through activity and get it heated up it feels a lot better i just saw a doctor in there and hes still convinced its muscular just for that reason
3206584 it is good news that its muscular its just a matter of stretching it out and its not real comfortable now to do that weve got to fight through some things and hopefully break through some adhesions and get all of that ironed out and gradually it starts feeling better
3206585 i really dont know the way we do things around here its like day to day were doing plenty of activity ive been swimming lifting running were doing everything we can to treat it in addition to throwing weve just got to kind of evaluate it every day when we come in see where were at
3206586 weve got to play some long toss first before we get off the mound thats what were working on now hopefully thats the next step
3206587 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3206588 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3206589 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3206590 what were here to do is get you involved in wind power
3206591 were also talking about zoning issues for wind power most counties dont have zoning related to wind power
3206592 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3206593 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3206594 if this investment had been made the food bowl including the north south pipeline a decade ago there would now be 200 billion litres of water flowing down the murray river which would be available for environmental flows
3206595 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3206596 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3206597 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3206691 but we have our unity and our democracy and freedom georgians have shown clearly they will stand up for these ideals
3206692 but what we will do is use every diplomatic means every judicial means every international organisation every leverage a small nation can have against a big one to first of all restore justice and return civilians to their places of residence

3206945 a defense of the particular habits and mores of american life
3206946 greed was traditionally considered a vice not for the american conservatives though
3206947 reagan came to power saying that government was the problem and this was essentially the conservative mantra
3206948 oh no no no no all we need are a couple of seals and a potato gun you just dont understand warfare the way we do after all the majority of us spent a great deal of our youth avoiding combat of any kind and because of this we had a lot of free time to do research
3206949 everyone knows the u n is filled with commies bent on overthrowing america bunch of goddamn commies is what they are hell im fucking retarded and i know that much

3206951 the president strongly denies ever making such a statement hes always maintained that the military is an extension of his whim and oedipal desires if you were paying attention instead of training to become a terrorist maybe youd know this
3206952 remember that part in the wizard of oz where president bush crushed the wicked witch with his giant penis and all the virgins gathered round to admire his huge balls well it will be a lot like that but about 10 000 times more wickeder seriously trust me i know about these things im a neo con and as you all know we neo cons are the only objective ones in this because its not as though we like some of you have been looking for an excuse to attack iraq for over a decade
3206953 why does bill clinton hate jesus ill tell you why because the democrat party despises good wholesome lovedness theyre not like us not in the least we love all love with a loving tenderness of joyous tranquility may god bless our freedom bombs
3206954 strap bombs to your asses and start blowing the fuck out of everyone oh but make sure to loot the joint first
3206955 this is exactly how we drew it up no need to worry iraq is not descending into chaos and those are not bombs theyre fireworks and the bodies youre seeing on the news are actually mannequins the iraqis love to celebrate by blowing up mannequins its a tradition that has existed for a thousand years in the middle east in fact the iraqis were blowing up mannequins long before mannequins even existed drink more red
3206956 oh and buy more flags and ribbon magnets for you suvs and buy more suvs and eat out every night and get an ipod and some other stuff dont let them win all hail the great zorg
3206957 did you hear we need to drink more red obviously those who doubt the war are communists which is why they drink the blue all hail the great zorg
3206958 we have reports coming in that confirm once and for all that iraq does not have any wmds nor were they involved in the attacks on 9 11 all i can say is whew thank zorg
3206959 but mr gannon didnt the preznit say iraq had wmds and that they were involved in the attacks on 9 11
3206960 are you on drugs of course he didnt the preznit made it very clear from the beginning that we were going into iraq because they were running low on freedom i have no idea where you heard this wmd 9 11 nonsense my guess would be the librul media and surely you know by now the librul media is more dangerous than al qaida stalin hitler and pauly shore movies combined no we went into iraq not because of wmds or 9 11 we went there to build a mc donalds and a couple of roller rinks all hail the great zorg
3206961 youre making the claim that mc donalds is a sign of freedom
3206962 i cant believe it all this time al qaida has had an operative in our midst
3206963 general rumsfield isnt it true that iraq is on the verge of civil war and isnt it also true that we dont have enough troops to maintain order
3206964 dont be crazy i am more than happy to hold the door
3206965 id never be able to live with myself if i went in ahead of you
3206966 bah its obvious you need a big mac more than i i just had one this morning
3206967 this goes on and on for 45 minutes until they finally decided to enter the mc donalds arm in arm now tell me do you think this is a bad thing or do you think this sounds like the sweet apple turnover of freedom
3206968 i never said anything about a video and if you knew anything about anything youd know they were clearly iraqis
3206969 fine then what about all the fraud and mismanagement of funds in iraq specifically haliburton which has very close ties to the vise preznit also we were told this war would only cost a few billion dollars and the cost is now on pace to exceed a trillion
3206970 jumping juniper berries how stupid are you people ill explain again the money being used in iraq was found in the basement of an old abandoned building it was just sitting there and we decided to put that money to good use no one even knew it existed until
3206971 so youre saying the american tax payer is not absorbing the cost of this mismanaged poorly planned war
3206972 thepreznit and the decider type doer of all stuff prezinitional has decided see
3206973 always was larry and im not sure i like your line of questioning
3206974 yes is the preznit now claiming to be the one who advocated for a larger military force at the beginning of the war
3206975 what do you mean claiming the preznit has always wanted a larger force but his plan met a great deal of resistance from the al qaidacrats in congress theyre the ones who chose the number of troops at the beginning of the war
3206976 is the preznit now admitting that the maliki government is completely dysfunctional wrought with corruption and incapable of even deciding what theyll have for breakfast in parliament
3206977 thats an outright lie everyone knows parliament decided months ago that their standard breakfast fare would consist of an egg mc muffin hash browns and a small coffee get your facts straight
3206978 oh no no no no all we need are a couple of seals and a potato gun you just dont understand warfare the way we do after all the majority of us spent a great deal of our youth avoiding combat of any kind and because of this we had a lot of free time to do research

3207038 falta pasar el reconocimiento m dico y esas cosas pero est todo hablado
3207039 la temporada pasada con el descenso de categor a se me comunic que no iban a contar conmigo
3207040 por supuesto que estoy ilusionado por la posibilidad de empezar una etapa nueva en un club con un proyecto muy bonito como tiene el tenerife
3207041 en los ltimos a os es verdad que he jugado quiz m s atr s pero en el fondo era m s por lo que me ped a el entrenador que por el hecho de que yo me sintiese m s c modo
3207042 en los a os que pas en el murcia tuve la oportunidad de actuar en muchas demarcaciones
3207043 y lo que uno siempre intent fue ayudar al equipo
3207044 s que en la isla hay mucha gente con ilusi n pero esa ilusi n tambi n est presente en bastantes ciudades de espa a que tienen equipos en segunda
3207045 he tenido la suerte de lograr dos ascensos con el murcia y de poder jugar en primera
3207046 est claro que para un club es algo precioso disfrutar de la m xima categor a
3207047 el tenerife lleva unos a os sin disfrutar de ese privilegio y vamos a ver lo que pasa

3207052 la invasi n de una acera p blica en el n cleo de tamaimo por parte de una obra privada a sabiendas del alcalde
3207053 realmente enorme lo que demuestra la acogida grand sima que ha tenido esta iniciativa
3207054 entre ellos se est n creando muchas expectativas pero lo fundamental ser conseguir que esta iniciativa no haga que los agricultores dejen de ser agricultores y se dediquen a la producci n de energ a que deber ser vertida a la red una vez generada
3207055 llevar una velocidad adecuada podr a evitar un tercio de los muertos en carretera unos 900 adem s de disminuir las consecuencias del suceso
3207056 reducir los accidentes con las v ctimas mortales en los que la velocidad es causa de los mismos

3207071 bei allen anstrengungen k nnen wir uns von den weltweiten entwicklungen auf dem energiemarkt leider nicht abkoppeln
3207072 diese belastungen sind f r viele nur schwer zu schultern
3207073 immerhin k nnen die kunden der stadtwerke sicher sein die preise unseres unternehmens in der f cherstadt geh ren im vergleich zu den anderen gro st dten zu den g nstigen
3207074 die weltweite nachfrage nach energie nimmt sprunghaft zu und wird wohl weiterhin steigen
3207075 vor allem wegen der rasanten wirtschaftlichen entwicklung in china indien und anderen regionen der welt da es sehr zeitaufw ndig und teuer ist neue l gas und kohlevorkommen zu erschlie en kann das angebot nicht schritthalten
3207076 mit diesem ersten cluster atlas f r baden w rttemberg k nnen regionale projektvorschl ge f r den ausbau und aufbau weiterer clusterinitiativen besser zugeordnet und bewertet werden
3207077 der cluster atlas schafft transparenz und benennt zudem die in den einzelnen clustern bestehenden clusterinitiativen und netzwerke sowie die jeweils in einer region angesiedelten relevanten forschungs und technologieinfrastruktureinrichtungen
3207078 die unternehmen stehen heute angesichts der weiter zunehmenden internationalen verflechtung der m rkte und eines anhaltend hohen innovationstempos unter erh htem wettbewerbsdruck
3207079 sie werden ihre internationale wettbewerbsf higkeit nur halten und ausbauen k nnen wenn fr hzeitig im rahmen von strategischen allianzen wissenschaftliche erkenntnisse und neueste forschungsergebnisse in neue produkte und prozesse umgesetzt werden
3207080 damit kann dieser atlas einen wirksamen beitrag zur profilierung der regionalen cluster bilden er soll aber auch den landesweit t tigen clustereinrichtungen und netzwerken sowie bw i als standortagentur f r ihre internationalen aktivit ten zur verf gung gestellt werden
3207081 there are multiple reasons people are atheists one which i speculate is your reason and which you will undoubtedly deny is because you suffered some sort of childhood abuse or have been deeply hurt by someone close to you the reason i make that assumption is because you lash out at the idea of being subject to anyone or anything
3207082 the same reason you choose to deny there is a god is the same reason you dont understand the principles of biblical marriage my wife loves fulfilling her role as my wife a biblical husband isnt set up to be a dictator but a helpmate
3207083 in no way is my wife any less than i she has an obligation to respect me and love me the same as i do her she trusts which trust is fundamental to a marriage me enough to be subject to my decisions
3207084 b listen i understand that you like your little dom sub relationship ive got no problem with that but call it what it is okay your bible says that a woman should be subject to her husband in the same way that her husband is subject to god until you start telling me that you think you and god are equals dont try to tell me that you think you and your wife are equals b i know that you can love someone without them being your equal its like loving a child or a pet its still valid but its nothing compared to a love in which two partners see each other as equally important and equally ranked
3207085 i pray that god would open your eyes to true love and you would quit basing your perception of love on what youve been shown

3207097 we are going to strengthen the security at scenic spots to make sure no sharp weapons can be brought into the area
3207098 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
3207099 its just an utter tragedy its as simple as that theres nothing to hang it on its just a crazy man
3207100 how do you live with that how do you live with any of it the mind just doesnt want to comprehend any of it really its just so random and incredible
3207101 we really feel for those people because we dont want them to be discouraged by this sort of thing happening
3207102 i didnt know what i was going to do about it its very kind and very thoughtful of these gentlemen to help out im most grateful
3207103 weve been able to muster a pretty big team at pretty short notice
3207104 this will be the last opportunity to purchase these stunning units at realistic prices they will sell well below the replacement cost we are all excited as is the market
3207105 the fact that its a mortgagee sale will attract interest on its own because we dont see that many of them here a cynic may say its a great marketing ploy

3207112 i think its another outstanding fall schedule for our program and we will see probably the best 300 players in division i tennis at these tournaments
3207113 when i came here on my recruiting trip i fell in love with oklahoma
3207114 it was an incredible atmosphere and being from texas it was close to home
3207115 being with tom for so long i had an idea what coach williams was going to be like he was exactly what i was used to i was very comfortable with his style of coaching and the way he said i would play a role on the team

3207126 democracy is stronger than any of their bombs any of their tanks
3207127 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3207128 a few of these guys is going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3207129 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3207130 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3207131 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3207132 its non displaced which is good news as were looking at it now we dont think it will be too long after that two week period
3207133 whether its three weeks or a little bit sooner than that or a little bit later im not sure
3207134 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3207135 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3207136 we typically make fun of bungled police operations by saying they were conducted by the gang that couldnt shoot straight
3207137 in this case they could shoot straight as a result they killed a familys two dogs in the midst of a misguided drug raid
3207138 rather than carefully checking the facts including talking to the local police department the county authorities acted rashly illustrating how the drug war threatens the liberties of all americans
3207139 absent exigent circumstances not present here so called no knock raids are an affront to the constitution
3207140 so is a shoot first ask questions later philosophy by the police yet the prince georges police have done this before last fall they invaded a house at the wrong address and shot the family dog all americans are at risk when the police behave this way just ask yourself what might happen if a suspicious package is delivered to your home and the cops bust in
3207141 but there is an even larger point law enforcement agencies have become more arrogant and less accountable in cases other than those involving drugs most people are aware of well publicized examples like waco and ruby ridge but similar abuses are common across the country though they usually receive little or no public notice
3207142 we all want police to do their jobs well but part of doing their job well is respecting the peoples constitutional liberties
3207143 as president i will ensure that federal law enforcement agencies set a good example for the rest of the country
3207144 in a barr administration government officials will never forget that it is a free people they are protecting

3207177 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3207178 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3207179 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3207180 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3207181 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3207182 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3207183 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3207184 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3207185 this is something that was made up by that rag in the u k its just complete nonsense
3207186 we arent doing anything differently than any other year and we actually have less attrition this year than last year
3207187 we constantly talk to associates at simpson and we would have heard of something by now
3207188 ive heard the same simpson rumors but i havent seen anything definitive
3207189 so many practice groups right now are quiet and we dont have a bankruptcy upswing like we did with the last downturn
3207190 right now we just have to wait and see how this is going to pan out
3207191 i dont know how widespread it is but since the end of 2007 and the beginning of this year simpson began concentrating on these performance reviews
3207192 i do know its still happening across the board and theyre focusing more on the midlevels than otherwise would be the case because theyre the easiest to get rid of
3207193 theyll say i dont think you have a future here so maybe you should have a look around in the market
3207194 its very sneaky and sort of the opposite of what cadwalader did with its layoffs
3207195 im 100 percent certain that no one has been laid off in my office in the past five years and i would be shocked if layoffs were the case because i havent heard anything to that effect
3207196 but there are 600 lawyers in the new york office so who knows how these things get started
3207197 i think his intentions were well meaning if maybe a bit misdirected
3207198 he has no personal interest in democratic politics and he could easily sit back and do nothing right now
3207199 and yet he spends an inordinate amount of time and money on it because he believes in the cause
3207200 ive been chosen to provide members of the network of tuc with all of the legal services to all our network members
3207201 i dont know it looks like they took that footage from one of the initial meetings
3207202 fake court documents to persuade local law enforcement officials into assisting them in foreclosing entire bank branches
3207203 the concept in and of itself had all kinds of wonderful legalities in it
3207204 but i kept asking the question what is the alternate currency backed by and i couldnt get an answer
3207205 we are definitely looking forward to a resolution in this case that gives those denied coverage on an unfair basis the full scope of remedies
3207206 were not planning to follow aetnas example at this time
3207207 it is undisputed that her temporary work was performed exclusively at bellevue on schedules set and approved by that hospitals staff
3207208 to bear in mind all of the case specific variables that we and other courts have identified as relevant to the reasonableness of the attorneys fees in setting a reasonable rate
3207209 the district court got it exactly right the reasonableness of the attorneys fees incurred linked directly to the ability to maintain the case as an flsa collective action
3207210 by the time we get the case its often too late
3207211 its often hard to get a good nights sleep when you feel the lawyering in a case has not been good
3207212 clients like the concept of outsourcing work but want someone to establish the process and provide verification from our perspective we are bringing a solution to a perceived client need we will hopefully be introduced to new clients through this and it will lead the way for the firm to act for them on larger scale work
3207213 using paralegals in allows us to reduce our chargeout rates to clients for paralegal services generally it will not save costs for the firm
3207214 i felt that a cheeseburger would be an appropriate subject to work with because of its icon status in american bigger the better culture
3207215 working with the scale of the wall the design becomes a glorious godlike icon in an american city and the cheeseburger design represents the good life
3207216 ive been working my entire adult life to help build an america where economic justice is being served
3207217 i hope nobody notices how often i change my mind

3207229 hai anak adam seandainya engkau datang kepadaku dengan dosa sepenuh bumi sedangkan engkau ketika menemuiku dalam keadaan tidak menyekutukanku sedikitpun niscaya aku berikan kepadamu ampunan sepenuh bumi pula
3207230 barangsiapa meninggal dunia dalam keadaan tidak berbuat syirik kepada allah sedikit pun niscaya akan masuk surga dan barangsiapa meninggal dunia dalam keadaan berbuat syirik kepada allah niscaya akan masuk neraka

3207258 flickr almost certainly the best online photo management and sharing application in the world has two main goals
3207259 1 we want to help people make their photos available to the people who matter to them
3207260 maybe they want to keep a blog of moments captured on their cameraphone or maybe they want to show off their best pictures to the whole world in a bid for web celebrity
3207261 to do this we want to get photos into and out of the system in as many ways as we can from the web from mobile devices from the users home computers and from whatever software they are using to manage their photos
3207262 flickr is the wd 40 that makes it easy to get photos from one person to another in whatever way they want
3207263 once you make the switch to digital it is all too easy to get overwhelmed with the sheer number of photos you take with that itchy trigger finger
3207264 part of the solution is to make the process of organizing photos collaborative in flickr you can give your friends family and other contacts permission to organize your photos not just to add comments but also notes and tags people like to ooh and ahh laugh and cry make wisecracks when sharing photos why not give them the ability to do this when they look at them over the internet and as all this info accretes around the photos as metadata you can find them so much easier later on since all this info is also searchable flickr continues to evolve in myriad ways all of which are designed to make it easier and better check out the flickr blog to stay apprised of the latest developments the fact that youve read to the end of this entire document and are hanging out at the bottom of this page with nothing but this silly text to keep you company is proof of a deep and abiding interest on your part what are you waiting for go explore
3207265 first you can get to your bookmarks from anywhere no matter whether youre at home at work in a library or on a friends computer
3207266 second you can share your bookmarks publicly so your friends coworkers and other people can view them for reference amusement collaboration or anything else note that you can also mark bookmarks on del icio us as private only viewable by you if you like
3207267 third you can find other people on del icio us who have interesting bookmarks and add their links to your own collection everyone on del icio us chooses to save their bookmarks for a reason you have access to the links that everyone wants to remember you can see whether two people have chosen to remember a link or whether it was useful enough for a thousand people to remember which may help you find things that are useful for you too

3207292 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3207293 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3207294 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3207295 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3207296 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3207297 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3207298 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3207299 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3207300 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3207301 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3207302 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3207310 the sustained increase in nih funding at musc during the last three years is particularly noteworthy because of the flat or declining budget at the federal level and serves as a solid indicator of the quality of programs as all nih research proposals are peer reviewed and rigorously evaluated
3207311 these achievements reflect the sustained effort of many talented faculty fellows and students and also musc leadership state support increasing program connectivity across the region and the many dedicated people in our research support units
3207312 serves as another platform for the areas growth in life sciences as new companies and licensing agreements spring forth from musc technology and research
3207313 an important mechanism for continued research growth at musc is the states centers of economic excellence program coee and the south carolina research infrastructure act that allows the university to recruit the best scientists to south carolina and create university based research centers in areas that will help grow south carolinas economy and create jobs
3207314 the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted
3207315 in the preamble of this act 12 henings stat 84 religious freedom is defined and after a recital
3207316 in these two sentences is found the true distinction between what properly belongs to the church and what to the state
3207317 believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship that the legislative powers of the government reach actions only and not opinions i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience i shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore man to all his natural rights convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties
3207318 coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order
3207319 there cannot be a doubt that unless restricted by some form of constitution it is within the legitimate scope of the power of every civil government to determine whether polygamy or monogamy shall be the law of social life under its dominion
3207320 the question is raised whether religious belief can be accepted as a justification of an overt act made criminal by the law of the land the inquiry is as to the guilt of one who knowingly violates a law which has been properly enacted if he entertains a religious belief that the law is wrong
3207321 laws are made for the government of actions and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions they may with practices suppose one believed that human sacrifices were a necessary part of religious worship would it be seriously contended that the civil government under which he lived could not interfere to prevent a sacrifice

3207324 the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent and believe in the gospel
3207325 those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick luke 5 32 i have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
3207326 thus it is written that the christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead
3207327 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
3207328 then to the gentiles also god has granted repentance that leads to life
3207329 therefore o king agrippa i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision
3207330 from going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it
3207331 behold all that he has is in your hand only against him do not stretch out your hand
3207332 from going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it
3207333 these men are servants of the most high god who proclaim to you the way of salvation

3207345 how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born
3207346 truly truly i say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god
3207347 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life john 3 17 for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him john 3 18 whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only son of god john 10 9 i am the door if anyone enters by me he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture acts 2 21 and it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the lord shall be saved acts 4 11 this jesus is the stone that was rejected by you the builders which has become the cornerstone acts 4 12 and there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved
3207348 believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved you and your household

3207387 the fact that magnetic fields interact so weakly with biological organisms is also important for safety considerations
3207388 the crucial advantage of using the non radiative field lies in the fact that most of the power not picked up by the receiving coil remains bound to the vicinity of the sending unit instead of being radiated into the environment and lost

3207398 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3207399 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as
3207400 focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3207401 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3207402 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3207403 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3207404 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3207405 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3207406 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3207407 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3207408 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3207409 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3207410 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3207411 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3207412 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3207413 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3207414 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3207415 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3207416 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3207417 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3207418 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3207419 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3207420 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3207421 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3207422 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3207423 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3207424 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3207425 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3207426 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3207427 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3207428 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3207429 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3207430 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3207431 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3207432 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3207433 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3207434 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3207435 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3207436 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3207437 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3207438 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3207439 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3207440 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3207441 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3207442 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3207443 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3207444 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3207445 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3207446 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3207447 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3207448 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3207449 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3207450 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3207451 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3207452 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3207453 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3207454 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3207455 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3207456 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3207457 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3207458 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3207459 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3207460 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3207461 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3207462 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3207463 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3207464 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3207465 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3207471 any driver deemed to be driving unnecessarily slowly during their out or in laps during qualifying or during the reconnaissance laps for which the pit lane is open prior to the race or in a manner which might endanger other drivers will be reported to the stewards the fia have announced as far as bahrain is concerned this means cars leaving the pits will be timed between the second safety car line 50 metres before turn one and the first safety car line after turn 15 and any car exceeding a time of 1m 39s between these points will be deemed to have been driven unnecessarily slowly the move is designed to prevent drivers on flying qualifying laps being impeded by drivers travelling more slowly it follows the five place grid penalties handed to both mclaren drivers at the last round in malaysia where heikki kovalainen and lewis hamilton were judged to have hampered the progress of rivals
3207472 alguns dizem que os animais n o tem alma e s o incapazes de ter emo es
3207473 coloque gato ai dentro n s vamos levar ele conosco
3207474 gato voc est vindo com a gente voc salvou as nossas vidas
3207475 porque n o suporta a id ia de me perder porque acha que nunca vai poder me substituir
3207476 e para onde acha que eu irei quando deixar voc
3207477 de que cor s o meus olhos meu p lo
3207478 os olhos s o dourados e o p lo marrom um marrom intenso e vivo
3207479 e em que parte do corpo tenho p los mais escuros
3207480 nas costas no rabo nas pernas no nariz e nas orelhas
3207481 eu vejo voc no parapeito da janela da cozinha observando os passarinhos na minha cadeira preferida na escrivaninha deitado em cima dos pap is de que eu preciso no travesseiro ao meu lado noite
3207482 voc consegue me ver em todos esses lugares agora mesmo de olhos fechados
3207483 ent o sempre que voc quiser me ver tudo o que precisa fazer fechar os olhos
3207484 e seria poss vel que outras plantas e flores nascessem no mesmo solo do algodoeiro uma rosa poderia nascer ao lado do algod o n o
3207485 e todas as plantas se alimentariam do mesmo solo e da mesma chuva n o
3207486 ent o todas as plantas a rosa e o algod o seriam muito parecidas por dentro mesmo aparentando ser muito diferentes por fora
3207487 e voc sabe onde est o todos os outros peda os de barbante e todos os outros rolos
3207488 mas mesmo sem saber onde est o voc acredita que eles existem e mesmo que alguns peda os de barbante estejam com voc e outros estejam em outros lugares mesmo que alguns sejam curtos e outros sejam compridos e mesmo que seu rolo de barbante n o seja o nico no mundo voc concorda que h uma rela o entre todos os barbantes
3207489 nunca tinha pensado nisso mas acho que sim h uma rela o
3207490 o que aconteceria se um peda o de barbante ca sse no ch o
3207491 bom ele ia acabar enterrado e se decompondo na terra
3207492 e talvez nascesse mais algod o naquele lugar ou uma rosa
3207493 quer dizer que a rosa no parapeito da janela pode ter alguma rela o com o barbante na sua m o e tamb m com todos os barbantes que voc nunca viu
3207494 agora pegue uma ponta do barbante em cada m o
3207495 a ponta na m o esquerda o meu nascimento e a na m o direita minha morte agora junte as duas pontas
3207496 alguma parte do barbante parece diferente melhor ou pior que qualquer outra parte dele
3207497 o espa o dentro do c rculo parece diferente do espa o fora dele
3207498 lamba a m o pense em mim em todos os meus lugares costumeiros pense em todos os peda os de barbante pense no algod o e na rosa pense em como o interior do c rculo n o diferente do exterior
3207499 estamos mirando una o dos opciones tenemos la necesidad de fichar pero no tengo una respuesta concreta
3207500 de momento es un jugador m s de la plantilla y le utilizo como tal si pasa algo que var e esta situaci n ya actuaremos de otra manera
3207501 aunque el mercado se cierre a finales de agosto el caso etoo deber a de estar ya resuelto el d a 13 que es cuando jugamos el primer partido oficial lo que pase ese d a ser definitivo
3207502 es curioso lo de volver al barcelona a mi edad pero es un reto muy atractivo jugar en el bar a siempre es un honor para todos los jugadores y estar a las rdenes de luis enrique puede ser una experiencia nica de cara al futuro
3207503 la principal raz n de mi regreso es porque quiero ayudar al equipo
3207504 me sorprendi comprobar lo bien que me sent a pesar de que s lo me entrenaba una vez por semana
3207505 me voy a ir a pek n a ver a phelps batir mi r cord de forma an nima
3207506 no me sentir muy a gusto sentado en la grada sin ninguna capacidad oficial pero nunca me invitaron no vas a los juegos ol mpicos s lo por decir que vas especialmente siendo quien soy
3207507 nunca he sido invitado ni por el cio ni por la televisi n estadounidense ni por la federaci n internacional de nataci n cuando mi nombre es mencionado cada d a miles de veces en internet pero ellos prefieren invitar a otros deportistas o mandatarios pol ticos habr a que preguntarle a ellos ya sabr n porque lo hacen
3207508 spitz puede superarme ahora yo gan siete pruebas pero si hubiesen existido los 50 metros libres probablemente tambi n los habr a ganado
3207509 phelps es casi id ntico a m tiene el r cord del mundo en todas esas pruebas as que domina estas carreras igual que lo hac a yo me recuerda a m mismo pienso que lo que hice obviamente le ha inspirado
3207510 es un gran honor estar en el camp nou se ha cumplido un sue o es algo muy emotivo la l stima es que nos juguemos tanto aunque contra el bar a todo el mundo se juega mucho
3207511 presi n a adida que ellos soportan tienen la obligaci n de disputar la champions mientras que nosotros s lo venimos a cumplir un sue o
3207512 despu s de la forma y la predisposici n que mostramos en el partido contra el beitar y el 5 0 que conseguimos doy fe que si jugamos igual de bien que el mi rcoles pasado podemos tener un buen resultado para nosotros ser a un sue o ganar y vamos a luchar hasta el final para lograrlo
3207513 que el partido de liga del s bado fuera tan duro ya veremos c mo est el equipo
3207514 nosotros no tenemos nada que perder s lo espero que si tenemos que perder que lo hagamos frente al equipo del bar a y no contra todo lo que el club representa
3207515 a un conjunto que tambi n se equivoca tienen m s presi n que nosotros y la clave ser poder aprovechar los momentos de dudas o de debilidad que se les presenten
3207516 porque me encanta el f tbol lo amo ojal le pueda conocer
3207517 estaba preocupado por todo y por todos y eso afect a su rendimiento
3207518 focalizaran m s y salieran de la rutina de la villa ol mpica
3207519 lo que quiero es hacer mi mejor carrera y acabar lo m s arriba posible
3207520 no he nadado muy a gusto por la ma ana siempre me cuesta m s
3207521 que me toque pasar un control por sorpresa de entre 66 participantes es poco probable
3207522 que el positivo sea de una espa ola no me sorprende particularmente sin duda es un golpe para el ciclismo y el hecho de que la ciclista sea espa ola demuestra que tenemos un problema en espa a no se trata del primer positivo en el tour hubo m s casos es hora de que las autoridades de este pa s comiencen a hacer algo concreto durante a os no han sido lo suficientemente duras contra el dopaje y este es el resultado de su indulgencia
3207523 contra el city vi una peque a mejor a pero a n estamos lejos de la mejor condici n me gustar a ver m s un equipo que pensara mayormente en que la temporada est por comenzar que en los amistosos
3207524 en londres 2012 buscaremos tener s lo jugadores menores de 23 a os sin excepci n
3207525 los juegos nos necesitan m s a nosotros que a la inversa en barcelona y atenas no hubo jerarqu a porque los espectadores est n acostumbrados a las grandes estrellas
3207526 el f tbol ol mpico no es ninguna competencia para la fifa no lo fue nunca y no lo ser jam s nunca llegar a ser un segundo mundial porque aunque quieren a los mejores no los tendr n
3207527 hubo momentos en que los ingleses en nuestras manos parec an monigotes en el palco del estadio del ajax nos llegaron a decir que los del sevilla parec amos los globetrotters del f tbol
3207528 este equipo sabe perfectamente lo que hace que disfruta y hace disfrutar a los aficionados as que nosotros trataremos de darle un toque personal en lo que consideremos necesario
3207529 habr que acostumbrarse a saber ganar que es muy dif cil
3207530 ser bueno que los rivales nos respeten por que somos los mejores
3207531 no me da miedo que los jugadores se aferren a un sistema nosotros tenemos que estar orgullosos del f tbol que tenemos
3207532 pero eso no nos debe impedir que miremos hacia delante
3207533 estoy seguro de que los jugadores de la selecci n
3207534 no se van a conformar con lo conseguido y de que son capaces de asimilar nuevos conceptos
3207535 nuestros objetivos son los m ximos y eso no quiere decir que seamos petulantes o que no tengamos los pies en el suelo
3207536 este periodo me ha dado una oportunidad para relajarme y recuperarme as que espero estar bien para brno cuando volv de laguna seca el doctor mir me dijo que necesitaba una semana y media de reposo no pod a entrenar as que pas unos d as maravillosos en mallorca desconectando de todo
3207537 cuando me quitaron los puntos de la mano al volver de mallorca empec la rehabilitaci n la mano todav a me duele pero la mu eca tiene buena movilidad y los dedos ya no est n hinchados el pie todav a lo llevo vendado simplemente para evitar movimientos bruscos comenc a entrenar la semana pasada principalmente con mi bici
3207538 cuando no se logran los objetivos previstos todos estamos m s obligados y motivados para conseguir los t tulos
3207539 servir n para potenciar aspectos del equipo que pueden ser decisivos para alcanzar los t tulos
3207540 voy a tener m s seguridad y claridad en todo lo que haga
3207541 se or que la muestra b ya ha sido revelada y confirma el positivo
3207542 esto es una sensaci n diferente un ambiente m gico aqu no se juega por dinero se juega por prestigio

3207593 she says you will be afraid because she is ugly
3207594 she is hiding because of her eyes very few african have those colors in their eyes im sure the witch doctors think she is evil and will bring people bad luck thats probably why she is not playing with the other kids
3207595 they wont let her come near the huts she lives in the back where the chickens sleep
3207596 things like that are considered a sign from the gods
3207597 i told her you wanted to show her something beautiful
3207598 then i told her not to worry because the only ugly thing around here was you not her because you are so white

3207605 i use a mixture of leds and cfls at home it is interesting if a 5 watt led can put out slightly more light than a 5 watt cfl but hardly a revolution yet
3207606 lastly theres the issue of fixture optics leds can be a great choice where a moderate amount of light is concentrated in a narrow beam e g a torch light but theyre not well suited for general illumination as in the case of a table or floor lamp given the nature of their light distribution i dont see how leds will ever replace general service lamps
3207607 paul your last comment is incorrect leds will replace general service lamps we are doing this already in rvs what is required is to use the latest generation of hybright leds used in lightblasters nexled products that spread their 20 lumens of light over a cone of 150 degrees out from the surface of the chip earlier generations of leds are limited to as few as 15 degrees at only 3 lumens

3207617 finally starting to sort of feel good from the first hand injury then having the hand hurt again and being able to rehab through that and finally get to the point after six long weeks to be able to come through that
3207618 i was looking forward to him coming back as much as he was
3207619 its disappointing for me too i thought he was going to be our deadline deal getting him back healthy in the middle of the order
3207620 that leaves us three weeks for the season to be able to help in some type of capacity
3207621 finally starting to sort of feel good from the first hand injury then having the hand hurt again and being able to rehab through that and finally get to the point after six long weeks to be able to come through that
3207622 i was looking forward to him coming back as much as he was
3207623 its disappointing for me too i thought he was going to be our deadline deal getting him back healthy in the middle of the order
3207624 that leaves us three weeks for the season to be able to help in some type of capacity
3207625 i dont think anyone wants to play more than michael cuddyer its been a tough year and this is just another one of those things
3207626 i think for the most part people are just scared when they hear waste water treatment plant
3207627 the name sounds scary in and of itself and without understanding that its going to be totally concealed theres going to be no noise no smell that its going to provide this beneficial value
3207628 this is the first but the moment it is approved theyll be mushrooming all over the county
3207629 this will become like a sewer plant town which we dont want to happen
3207630 im here to represent for him because he cant be here right now to let you know we are going to progress with this
3207631 he asked me to convey on his behalf that those who committed this act are forgiven and all are invited to the table
3207632 we are going to unite black and brown were going to fight were going to continue this peace towards the streets were not going to stop
3207633 two oclock in the morning you know the russians are here and theyre coming here and thats the message on the telephone and things like that
3207634 im a pretty calm person but you know when youve got a baby and a pregnant wife and theyre upset its gets my attention
3207635 one has to keep a level head in times like this
3207636 so i got to coach myself on the plane and be ready to be the pillar when i get there
3207637 im still an american 100 percent but ive got a little georgian in me and so ive got some georgian patriotism and i want to see that country succeed
3207638 i said i may be free of angola but angola will never be free of me
3207639 end the use of solitary confinement and related forms of torture in u s prisons
3207640 the uses of devices of torture forced medication restraint beds restraint chairs
3207641 so its almost at a point where how could we not respond
3207642 some of the most litigious inmates in the departments custody
3207643 our prospects for victory are better because if we do this correctly we could possibly bring hundreds thousands even millions of people into the struggle
3207644 were going to have to go into the communities and educate people as well
3207645 our consciousness is not the same as people in the hood weve got to let them know whats happening get agitation and activation out of that
3207646 most prisoners dont know why they are in prison and most parents think their kids deserve to be there
3207647 raise political and social consciousness of raza prisoners educate the raza community as to the realities of the prison system
3207648 im here because we have got to save our children
3207649 if an inmate is going to hurt himself or others
3207650 this is a victory and we have to celebrate our victories
3207651 but it is a partial victory and so we have to remain vigilant
3207652 beat ing them up successfully in the courts and then bring ing them to the table to negotiate
3207653 understand that when you give incentives to prisoners in a normal humane way it makes for a safer place
3207654 while the conditions in the shu may press the outer bounds of what most humans can psychologically tolerate
3207655 at one time i thought that which was legal was ultimately moral
3207656 but my years my 29 years in solitary confinement and my 31 years serving time for a crime that the state knew i hadnt committed has taught me a lesson that legality and morality are not friends legality does not equal morality
3207657 abraham lincoln gets credit and other politicians get credit for abolishing slavery
3207658 but it really wasnt lincoln you know lincoln only did the will of the people it was the abolitionists people who looked at slavery and saw it as being something that was terrible
3207659 that is why it is so important that the struggle continues
3207660 ive been rock fishing for years and always wondered what i would do in this type of situation and i didnt think twice looking back on it i would do it again
3207661 the combination of extinctions global species migrations and the widespread replacement of natural vegetation with agricultural monocultures is producing a distinctive contemporary biostratigraphic signal these effects are permanent as future evolution will take place from surviving and frequently anthropogenically relocated stocks

3207667 at manchester we again showed we are reliable in defence
3207668 incorporate a domestic gas phase as part of our foundation project
3207669 under our state agreement with the wa government we were initially planning to submit a proposal for development of a 300 tj per day domestic gas plant by 31 december 2010 but we now plan to accelerate this to coincide with our development proposals to government for the lng phase
3207670 that means when we consider fid final investment decision we will consider fid for both lng and domestic gas with the domestic gas plant ready for start up to coincide at or around the commissioning of the projects third lng train
3207671 bringing on gorgons domestic gas phase earlier will increase the number of supply points for domestic gas into wa and has been welcomed by the state government
3207672 its pretty self evident that the uplift in the second half in terms of eps earnings per share is fundamentally different and stronger than the first half
3207673 theyre not mutually exclusive and ive said previously that our job is to run the bank for the interests of st george shareholders
3207674 the proposal by westpac is subject to it being in the interests of shareholders and clearly weve put that to the market place
3207675 westpac would know from its due diligence process the underlying performance of the group and so does the market
3207676 and then parallel to that weve also got the independent experts report being progressed as well
3207677 i can only deal with what ive got at the moment which is lots of transparency around the business to the market
3207678 one of the big problems weve had is its moving faster than we thought

3207690 i think weve managed to build what id call a decent squad at the moment
3207691 to get a further two years to work with the squad that weve got and the young players coming through i couldnt be more pleased
3207692 im concerned that this figure of 100 000 job losses is on top of the treasury prediction in may
3207693 i have asked the government repeatedly to explain why it predicted 134 000 job losses
3207694 this is very serious this is about peoples jobs peoples livelihoods and the government must come clean and indicate where why and which areas of the economy there are going to be job losses
3207695 the reserve bank was put in an impossible position last year by the incoming rudd government
3207696 it had inherited the best economic conditions of any incoming federal government in our history yet both kevin rudd and wayne swan went overboard in their rush to blacken the economic credentials of the howard government
3207697 in fact business and consumer confidence remained strong through the asian economic crisis
3207698 even post september 11 when the world thought it was on the brink of some catastrophic outcome business and consumer confidence dropped but came back up again because people had confidence in the leadership of the country to steer them through these difficult international times

3207713 i heard he misses it so he wanted to come stay in a dorm again
3207714 i told him id like him to come spend a couple days visit and have him visit with the team here one of these nights before we leave
3207715 the thing i learned having been through it is it takes the same things to go there and lose that it took to go there and win
3207716 getting there is so hard everybody works hard you have to find a way to work harder everybody works smart you have to find a way to work a little smarter then you have to be lucky
3207717 everyone has to do it his own way with his own philosophy
3207718 i told him so last year was a tough year but you can come out of a tough year better for having the experience everybody goes through that adversity

3207723 theoretically speaking the church could set its mind on reducing its relationships to a minimum endeavoring to isolate itself from dealings with secular society just as it could set itself the task of pointing out the evils that can be found in secular society condemning them and declaring crusades against them
3207724 so also it could approach so close to secular society as to strive to exert a preponderant influence on it or even to exercise a theocratic power over it and so on

3207789 kami komuniti pelajar uitm membantah keras pandangan membuka uitm sedemikian kami mendapati alasan bahawa tindakan mengkhaskan uitm hanya kepada masyarakat bumiputera menyebabkan pelajar bumiputera kurang berinteraksi dan sebagainya adalah tidak benar
3207790 selepas ini kami akan menyerahkan memorandum yang serupa kepada perdana menteri dan kemudian yang di pertuan agong yang juga canselor uitm ini akan dilakukan minggu depan
3207791 sehingga malam ini kami sudah memperoleh tandatangan menyokong memorandum bantahan daripada lebih 5 000 pelajar dan ia mungkin akan mencecah 10 000 orang esok
3207792 memorandum ini bertujuan meminta beliau menteri besar selangor menarik balik kenyataannya kerana bertentangan dengan prinsip penubuhan uitm sebagai sebuah institusi pengajian tinggi bagi melahirkan profesional di kalangan bumiputera
3207793 maaf saya tak dapat nak beri komen mengenai perkara ini sehingga menteri pengajian tinggi membuat kenyataan rasmi mengenai perkara ini
3207794 this is why they dont know as much about it as they should nobody wants to even so much as look at it never mind touch it examine it or be in the vicinity of it
3207795 imagine if one those pustule goblins squirts out at me
3207796 these are people who not only have a very long life but they are healthy up to a very old age
3207797 these are not people whove gotten diseased or dementia at 70 years old and somehow lived another 30 years
3207798 to be sure everyone wants to live as long as possible and everyone is looking into our study to find the recipe
3207799 do you think you can find her a husband in the united states
3207800 the other girls had a nice quiet life and they died young
3207801 here in sardinia we have always understood that one can live for a long time and live well
3207802 we have wild olive trees here that have lived for 3 000 years
3207803 there are a lot of lies in other places but our records are certified
3207804 after studying centenarians for a long time i now understand there are certain common characteristics when i see a person i dont usually say anything but i can tell if someone has the characteristics of a centenarian
3207805 you seem like you have the characteristics of someone who might become a centenarian
3207806 one died at age 68 and the other in his mid 50s
3207807 longevity is a complex thing centenarians are not a homogenous group i wonder if what were seeing today is more an act of natural selection or what were seeing is because of habit or lifestyle
3207808 there is so much guardedness fear and paranoia in this field
3207809 the mice were still fat but they looked just as healthy as the lean animals
3207810 we chose urzulei and talana because they simplify our job
3207811 if you visit the villages you will see that they have a very similar style of life
3207812 its hard to say someone has good genes maybe there was a gene that allowed them to eat less and still survive in poorer times but maybe in richer times they eat more and become obese
3207813 knowledge of history is integral to this type of genetic research we believe that some day we may use some of this anecdotal knowledge perhaps to compare the type of work someone did or the types of houses they lived in or the type of daily stress they might have had to some this information may sound na ve but i think this history of health will become important in years to come more and more people are realizing the importance of the context of where you live
3207814 i started working in the fields when i was four years old
3207815 it was a normal way of working we spent long days walking the countryside i did not know how to stand still
3207816 the life of a shepherd was hard but not very stressful
3207817 death is terrifying but it would be even more terrifying to find out that are you going to live forever and never die
3207818 i cant go anyplace i want to go i cant work i cant hear a conversation between people the only thing i can do is sew lace it makes the time pass

3207835 hey could you stop doing whatever its making me uncomfortable
3207836 i didnt pay attention to the entire announcement we get severe thunderstorm warnings frequently they are followed by rain wind and lightning sometimes other times we briefly see only dark clouds

3207841 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
3207842 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
3207843 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
3207844 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
3207845 mr budrys did some good things for this hospital in the 11 years that he was here and the hospital owes him a certain amount for that
3207846 but every leader looks at things differently and i dont think theres anything wrong with saying that our priorities are probably different what was most important to him might be fifth most important to me but the goal is to make this the best community hospital it can be
3207847 the most important thing i can do in my role here is to take care of our employees
3207848 we have to give them the technology and the environment to make them want to come to work if we take care of our employees we take care of our patients we make sure they are getting the highest quality care from people who care about what they are doing
3207849 i think there are things about us that are not any different than any of the challenges faced by any public hospital
3207850 we have to remember that in addition to being high tech we want to be high touch i say all the time that we have and we want staff that treats patients like they would treat their own neighbors because in many cases they are treating their neighbors
3207851 when there is a change in leadership you tend to look at things differently
3207852 you tend to come out of yourself a little bit
3207853 you take a look at the way you do business
3207854 you get used to a way of doing things and then you find yourself re examining that were about service first
3207855 barring any surprising influx of massive cash piles im afraid the show wont be able to continue past the end of the year
3207856 the time and costs involved in recording and producing each show have grown and there are lots of other projects demanding my time and attention in the internet radio world
3207857 e scapes began as a hobby and passion and it still is very close to my heart theres nothing id rather do more than talk with these amazing artists and help bring their music to the world that will of course continue through our internet station radio mystic and other projects but to be honest the podcast is basically up in the air right now im not sure what can be done were going to try a couple of things to keep it going as long as we can accepting advertising from legitimate businesses and individuals who offer products and services related to the music we play on radio mystic and an appeal for donations from our listener and fan base well see what happens
3207858 oh what a lovely whatever the fuck that is lets see what it does next and write a research article for a magazine about it
3207859 i want to put a down payment of x xxx on a house i want xx xxx in my sons college account by 18 i want to have x xxx xxx by the age 65 in my fund
3207860 youll have to forgive me for being an eisenhower republican
3207861 i dont know how much you know about my grandfathers administration
3207862 but that administration stood for multilateral engagement balancing the budget
3207863 he has very little debt i just love it anybody who wants to make him out as this wide eyed liberal i just dont see any evidence for that not in the way he runs his campaign and this tells you a lot about how he can administer things how he manages things how he deals with situations
3207864 this race is very similar to the 1952 campaign that brought my grandfather to power
3207865 he was an outsider who was nominated by the republican party but it was not an easy process at all he was an outsider who threatened to shake up the party itself
3207866 it is this very weird moment where republicans are very divided
3207867 its accurate to say that you dont have a dominant set of ideas or a figure the party can really rally behind what you simply see are factions who arent forming to create a coherent vision
3207868 the 70s the great shift in american culture society and politics
3207869 youve seen this amazing united front by different factions that are much more at odds ideologically than the factions within the democratic party theyve all managed to put their feelings about one another aside to defeat a common enemy i dont think the fracturing youre seeing now will result in large numbers of republicans voting for obama but i do think youll see people willing to sit on their hands instead of work towards that common goal as they have in the past
3207870 both these parties have core constituencies that will support the party no matter what
3207871 even today george bush has a 28 percent approval rating there are cycles of american history where you see a real shift but i dont see a definitive change in party structure or alignment i see a national mood shift that gives the democrats and upper hand for the time being but if obamas elected both he and the party have to deliver
3207872 the thing we have to ask ourselves for this election is whether this is a small temporary change or permanent realignment
3207873 political parties change over decades to seize and capitalize on opportunities but what can happen whether youre a democrat or republican is you can wake up one morning and find yourself looking at a party whose standard bearer doesnt reflect the values that brought you to the party in the first place i can say that for this election im supporting barack obama because i think he will represent the future of america he is the future of america
3207874 my grandfather thought there were three things that comprised our national security one our ability to address our adversaries
3207875 by temperament and genetics i do recognize that were already there
3207876 but we have to understand that my grandfather a five star general understood that staying in korea wasnt a sustainable operation either and got the united states out of there
3207877 asking whether something is viable or not has nothing to do with patriotism
3207878 you can conclude youre damaging your long term national interests by holding the status quo one of the great expressions i grew up with as a child is perfect is the enemy of good we have to move forward in a good way because were never going to see a consensus on anything
3207879 for people who are being critical about barack obama talking about hope
3207880 i dont think they understand the first thing about american rhetoric and moving this country forward ronald reagan was not a success because he had people scared and frightened all the time he inspired thousands of people with hope when the cold war was stagnant and inflation was high and the country sour we now have another figure right now who has brought all sorts of people into the political process who has convinced a significant number of people that they were welcome on his team and has offered a crisp new chance to turn the page internationally
3207881 according to norman dombey professor of theoretical physics at the university of sussex saddams yellowcake could have yielded enough u235 for 142 bombs readers may also remember that one of saddams scientists was tasked with keeping the specifications and plans for nuclear bomb making which he buried in his back yard he even wrote a book about it
3207882 i was going to be accompanied by one of my advisers a former military officer and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political

3207890 what are we going to get nick a 25 cent pencil that says chicago on it
3207891 omg ob wont be on the 15th you wont see it until sept
3207892 a chicago state senator named barack obama voted against the death penalty for gang related murders when the time came to get tough obama chose to be weak so the question is can a man so weak in the war on gangs be trusted in the war on terror
3207893 it does matter if he is not telling the truth now
3207894 neither of these two committees has gotten to the so called tipping point where it actually has a profit they havent got to that point yet
3207895 the entire effort of these two groups is focused on the general election in november not earlier even if revenue was ten times what it is or more right now these groups would not be spending any serious funds on advertising as we are good managers and correctly conclude it would be a complete waste of the donors contributions to do so
3207896 the economy is in recession and as other parts of the economy have been affected so has political giving through direct mail because of the typically smaller margins on direct mail fundraising unless response rates and dollar amounts are high the program can lose money the economy has depressed both response rates and dollar amounts of contributions at least from what we were hoping for
3207897 i think i did give at one time i really dont know i maybe just gave once
3207898 once and it was a long time ago i stopped when i found out i wasnt getting what i expected

3207902 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3207903 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3207904 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3207905 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3207906 right now there is an ethnic cleansing of georgians in abkhazia
3207907 russias actions this week raise serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3207908 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3207909 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3207910 it is time for russia to be true to its word and act to end this crisis
3207911 weve seen a sharp decline not only in attacks but in foreign fighters traversing the western nineveh deserts
3207912 the iraqi police and army are becoming more capable and the extremists are being pushed into the rural areas because of this

3207915 georgia in a way is suffering for all that happened to russia in the last 20 years
3207916 washington and the administration are playing an extremely dirty game
3207917 they will show putin as an occupier even if putin is doing nothing
3207918 all his liberal speeches which he made in berlin and elsewhere are forgotten
3207919 he is playing the game which is designed by putin
3207920 now he can cruise the volga for all the remaining years or can go right to the bahamas
3207921 i must admit that for the first time in my life i felt admiration for the skill with which vladimir putin maintains his power

3207951 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
3207952 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

3207956 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
3207957 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
3207958 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
3207959 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3207960 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3207961 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3207974 we bought zing not to be in the mp3 player space we bought zing because we think the pc industry is going from speeds and feeds which is really what drove this industry for a lot of years to what we call needs and deeds things that you want to do that you want your computer to go do and a significant part of that is the solutions in the user interface on top of your pc and how easy is it for your pc and your other connected devices to work together so the zing acquisition for us is a 100 user interface engineers that help us to make our products easier to use going forward

3207978 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3207979 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3207980 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3207981 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3207982 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3207983 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3207987 the typical damage in this instance would be cracked interior or plaster or drywall glass and potentially even contents that are damaged as a result of shifting
3207988 its the impact of the explosion and then the resulting damage that comes from the impact
3207989 theres also the question of how much of the damage was insured apparently there are quite a few renters in the neighbourhood and many of them did not have tenants insurance
3207990 for as long as you cant operate and youre not making the money that you would normally make theres insurance coverage for that
3207991 its too late after the event to adjust your coverage to cover that sort of thing but the main thing is to get the claim in and hear what your personal situation is from your insurance company
3207992 in the meantime youve got to look after yourself as if you were not insured and youve got to make sure that any damages are mitigated by any actions you can take

3208000 he was a true warrior and just the person you would want beside you in a firefight
3208001 they were supposed to be over there as peacekeepers but it didnt turn out that way
3208002 he was always a bit of a rebel i guess you could say in terms of bucking authority sometimes but i think he felt the army was the authority he did like
3208003 i would say it sometimes takes a bit of a crazy person to join the army or to want to be in the army
3208004 he was always willing to try something at least once whether it was a good thing or a bad thing
3208005 hed been in contact before with the enemy so he knows what to expect
3208006 he knows how to get through it and that sort of experience is very valuable for young ncos
3208007 unfortunately he seemed to scare more kids than he cheered up but hes a great guy hes got a real sense of humour
3208008 remembered with the utmost gratitude and respect of this nation
3208009 he was an exceptional canadian and courageous soldier who died while bravely serving his country
3208010 their normal contact drill is that as soon as they get hit with something then its 360 open up on anything that moves

3208042 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
3208043 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
3208044 so they had a hearing late at night robin was put into jail and since that point he has been held here in colarado springs in the criminal justice center in el paso county basically just a regular old county jail with all kinds of people dangerous criminals many of them and its a difficult place to be but robins in good spirits and were now dealing with the consequences of his action in the military courts here
3208045 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd please see the page for what you can do
3208046 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
3208047 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
3208048 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
3208049 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
3208050 come on we can have a better country we can change this around
3208051 well if i were president the home morgate crisis wouldnt have happened and the oil prices wouldnt be what they are
3208052 dont vote for eugene debbs youre throwing your vote away
3208053 well during vietnam you welcomed draft dodgers so you should expand that today to welcome us
3208054 during vietnam canada welcomed deserters and they should today since this is another illegal war the canadian government has refused to officially sanction
3208055 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
3208056 in the economic arena all of a sudden you are seeing private investment you see the electricity grid is literally all up for the first time in about three years and oild production is up by some 400 000 barrels i think in the last six months as well in part because of electricit which then means there is more fuel for the electricity
3208057 a condition thats developed from the sickness of the iraq war will be treated if qaduir gets her way by divorcing it from the very cause and treating the womens response as abnormal when what happened to their husbands was the abnormal thing instead qaduirs accepting as normal the illegal war the occupation that goes along with it and all the violence involved the only abnormal thing to her is that some women might respond in violence imagine what she would have recommended for american woman participating in the revolutionary war
3208058 last controversial session before their summer break was attended by just over half of the legislatures and those that stuck it out didnt pass the provincial elections law after a bitter dispute over the oil rich city of kirkuk

3208061 the united states has spent four years and more than 20 billion on training and building iraqi security forces american instructors say the iraqis are now mostly able to fight insurgents and sectarian militias on their own
3208062 no we are not going to be ready to do it without the americans
3208063 two multi national force west marines died as the result of a non combat related incident near karmah aug 7 the marines names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin and release by the department of defense
3208064 one u s soldier was killed and two others wounded after an improvised explosive device struck their patrol in baghdad at approximately 9 30 p m aug 8
3208065 a multi national division baghdad soldier and four iraqi citizens were killed and others wounded during a complex attack in the tarmiyah district north of baghdad at approximately 2 p m aug 10 after an initial improvised explosive device detonated an mnd b team was sent to investigate shortly after the teams arrival a suicide vest attack occurred and was followed by small arms fire the attacks also wounded two u s soldiers 15 local nationals three iraqi policemen and three sons of iraq members
3208066 sundays attacks showed the challenges still facing american forces in iraq who number about 140 000 and the iraqi security forces who ultimately will have the task of protecting the country
3208067 a very clear message to the insurgents that there will be no other chance
3208068 turn yourself in well stop everything for one week turn yourself in
3208069 the first leader to visit iraq since the fall of saddam hussein in 2003
3208070 trip was shrouded in secrecy because of security concerns and revealed only when he had headed home
3208071 ties between the two neighboring countries had been strained since the fall of saddam because of jordanian fears that iraqs shiite led government was too friendly with shiite dominated iran jordanian officials have been concerned about iranian influence in iraq and the loss of discounted oil which saddam once provided
3208072 and are you surprised independent presidential candidate ralph nader is in canada ralph will be speaking at seven p m at the design exchange on 234 bay street in toronto admission is free but donations are welcome and

3208074 please give us a chance guys i think youll like what store name can do for you
3208075 is there anything i can do to get you to buy a mattress today
3208076 lots wife in looking back became pure distilled tear stuff the physical manifestation of sorrow
3208077 it is in no spirit of revenge that i remind you that as little as a year ago the whole of smart liberal opinion believed that the dissolution of baathism and militarism had been a mistake that iraq itself was a bottomless pit of wasted dollars and pointless casualties and that the only option was to withdraw as fast as possible and let the inevitable civil war burn itself out
3208078 the elementary school day and year in chicago proper are the shortest of any major u s city it lasts five hours and 45 minutes and the schools are open just 174 days per year this is entirely a result of the intransigence of the chicago teachers union ctu a staunch ally of barack obama and an early endorser of his presidential candidacy the ctu has vigorously resisted all attempts to increase instruction time in chicago schools in 2007 the ctu thwarted mayor richard m daleys attempt to make teachers teach for full school days they negotiated a new contract that contained no extra hours but significant pay raises for the next four years deborah lynch the previous ctu president agreed in 2003 to a 15 minute increase in the school day from five and a half hours in exchange for a seven day reduction in the school year and large annual raises the minor concession she made a net five hours of extra teaching time per year was used against her in the next teachers union election which she narrowly lost
3208079 now that all the drama is behind me im really happy to be back in la and back working again
3208080 the whole truth nothing but the truth so help me mac
3208081 it has already been shown that the animals at the baghdad zoo cannot be properly protected from the countrys military conflict
3208082 his ability to capture the moment was second to none
3208083 win or lose we had a great time every day
3208084 remarkable talent and a unique wit who had an unbridled joy for the atlanta braves
3208085 his impact on the braves can be characterized so simply braves win braves win braves win
3208086 this is a result of disciplined risk management practice the continued investment in people and systems against an overall risk appetite in the group thats frankly conservative
3208087 overall st georges credit quality remains very good despite the slowing in the economy
3208088 he was a fierce competitor but he always found humor in situations
3208089 he was a sports nut but he loved writing about it as much as playing sports it was his passion
3208090 theyd been out there in the field for three days and they were coming back in for a shower and a good meal
3208091 the reason this research is important is because in tasmania it was assumed that megafauna had gone extinct before humans arrived this paper shows thats not the case
3208092 this is probably the best evidence weve got for human predation of megafauna
3208093 one of the problems with these guys is they are all dating experts not archaeologists
3208094 the material needs to be placed in context relating to other finds or the sediments they are in
3208095 none of the sites they have examined have any archaeology associated with it so there is no evidence any of these species existed alongside humans
3208096 what they are doing is saying we cant find evidence of climate change therefore it must be humans it could be that there was short term climatic flux or competitive exclusion or a whole range of other things that caused the extinction
3208097 it is high time we respected and supported mandate given by the people to the ruling coalition in the february 18 elections
3208098 then again maybe i dont want you to tell me
3208099 its the 66th layer of the abyss the domain of lolth
3208100 its not called the infinite layers for nothing there are as many layers as there are types of evil
3208101 what do i do about this hang in there kid ill figure something out
3208102 hell have reappeared in whatever prime you folks come from
3208103 if lolth was angry before lets see her try this one on for size
3208104 sorry i didnt mean to squash you are you all right
3208105 you you saved me i didnt think anyone would come
3208106 because of you one of our friends got banished to who knows where the rest of us almost got eaten by a yochlol and now a minor deity is mad as hell at the lot of us
3208107 as a result of reading this advertisement i expect types of individuals to take this specific action
3208108 they laughed when i sat down at the piano but when i started to play
3208109 to make an ad effective you should definitely include a monkey wearing a hawaiian shirt and sunglasses or how about a cute baby with a melted chocolate ice cream cone on their head or flying pigs in ballerina costumes or a conga line of dancing lizards or you get the idea seriously there are no magic beans when it comes to advertising effectiveness the first and only rule of advertising is to recognize that there are no rules
3208110 the ad should always match the personality of the product or service youre selling yet do so in an arresting or interesting way you cannot bore people into buying your product
3208111 grab your readers attention consumers are bombarded by ads and messages you need to make your ad jump out of the pack with an attention grabbing headline or image that encourages them to read further
3208112 the most critical element of any ad whether its in print broadcast or electronic is the strategy to develop a strong strategy you need to understand three things the product the consumer and the marketplace you really need to know what youre selling who youre selling it to and what other choices are available to your customers
3208113 the average time someone reads a menu is about five minutes the average time someone reads an ad is three seconds have you tried to read an entire menu in three seconds it simply does not work please dont turn your ad into a menu ive been in situations where clients have asked me to bold the 12 things listed in their quarter page ad because every thing is so important what we tend to discover is that the list of features is only important to the owner not the end consumer advertising is not about including as much information as possible can we fit it should not be your strategy
3208114 less is more be visually and verbally to the point it is ok to explore the visual side make the ad complete by having the concept visuals and copy all co exist and complement each other humor always gets attention
3208115 advertising that ultimately falls into the great category are the ones that convey a single relevant and compelling message you never hear people talk about great ads that had the really big phone number and logo at the bottom on the canary yellow paper
3208116 many ads try to be creative and hip just to be creative and hip
3208117 what makes your product or service unique an effective ad will provide a solution by stressing a key unique benefit and what makes the product or service better or different than that of its competition
3208118 howard gossage a famous ad man from the 1960s once said
3208119 encourage the consumer to respond just like closing a sale an effective ad will make its pitch then ask and persuade the consumer to act whether its call now or ask about todays free offer strong and effective ads will engage the consumer and persuade them to actively respond to the message
3208120 make it easy for the reader to contact you whether it is by phone email or web or fax let them know who you are use your logo or identity dont hide
3208121 its important to understand that an ad cannot survive by itself it must be part of an overall message consistently delivered over time and its just one aspect of a total communications plan when you speak with one voice whether its in a print ad a radio commercial on your website through vehicle graphics in store signage or guerrilla marketing your overall effectiveness will improve and the results will follow
3208122 one thing is for sure we have to do better than what weve been doing
3208123 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3208124 what we are seeing are youngsters a community that is in revolt because they dont like they way they are being treated
3208125 we in russia we cannot see how we can do business with him
3208126 the immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces to their positions prior to august 7
3208127 to take further action as appropriate to help bring about and implement a peaceful and durable solution to the crisis
3208128 we have to wrap up the question of qualification to the group stage at home
3208129 artmedia are a team that score a lot but we are solid at the back and im not worried
3208130 end end end suppose users a and b both query person john doe
3208131 end end end and it gets called like conflicting data person conflicting person code zip code this way if there is no nested object the immediate attribute of the object is used but when i pass in a nested object the attribute of the nested object is used
3208132 its not the gun that makes the player its the player that makes the player
3208133 its going to assist in the transformation of the uae from a commodity based economy to a knowledge economy and it will create a lot of high quality jobs that will have an economic spillover effect
3208134 renewable energy powergen 2008 conference in amsterdam this week geiger said the project would add a minimum of 2 percent gdp growth to the uae economy not that abu dhabi the capital of the seven member uae federation needs the extra wealth
3208135 the hydrocarbon based economy will be with us for decades but what will fill that gap when the decline starts
3208136 we pursue a basket of technologies were very strong in solar while wind is not our primary focus
3208137 a goal of a base on the moon by 2020 and of a manned landing on mars by 2025 would reignite the space program and give it a sense of purpose in the same way that president kennedys moon target did in the 1960s
3208138 robotic missions are much cheaper and may provide more scientific information but they dont catch the public imagination in the same way and they dont spread the human race into space which im arguing should be our long term strategy
3208139 if the human race is to continue for another million years we will have to boldly go where no one has gone before
3208140 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
3208141 the market is up by a fraction of the width of a cigarette paper
3208142 the banks are ripping ahead today but were being dragged down by the resources twins bhp and rio which is not surprising with the price of oil down and metals stocks also weaker
3208143 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3208144 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3208145 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3208146 he was always the most popular member of our family
3208147 should i let my dog die because i didnt have the money
3208148 i could no more do that to him than i could for a person
3208149 were up against a tumor that has just a miserable prognosis
3208150 we will figure out how to treat these animals and tell the fda we can do it in people
3208151 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate the moonship is closing in fact this summer with the re alignment of our schedule its closed
3208152 for it is god who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
3208153 hes right handed which im kind of bummed about were trying to get him to be a lefty
3208154 ive been through a lot the last six months the last year and its helped me
3208155 it was tough to deal with it was something you just learn from
3208156 i was disappointed for my family for my son but you can let it destroy your life or you can move on and just roll with it
3208157 i know my teammates have my back and even my coaches they all saw how hard i was working
3208158 im out to prove im going to be a winner that i can get this team to the next level
3208159 as the starter your responsibilities are greater sometimes youre like its unfair i cant go out and be a normal person without someone constantly taking a picture
3208160 the next thing you know its on the internet and hes wasted
3208161 those are things you have to be aware of those are sacrifices im willing to make
3208162 im really not so sure his first two years this position was that important to him
3208163 i didnt sense an anger a work ethic things you have to have i sense matt now has a sense of urgency about this game
3208164 kurts been doing it a long time so he anticipates things because hes a veteran player matt is starting to get to that point
3208165 were very fortunate we have two quarterbacks who can play
3208166 i really believe we both deserve to have the opportunity to start
3208167 it would be so nice to just be somewhere else where i could just play
3208168 ive thought about it but i dont want to go anywhere else
3208169 i was a big fast food eater my body was young i could fake it i was at papa johns every other night eating like i was still in college now ive got to be a little bit smarter with my body
3208170 i had to force myself to run i had no strength there coming in refreshed even missing nine games last year kind of helped me out because it let me breathe a little bit now im ready to get rolling again
3208171 everybody was frustrated it was tough to sit from the sideline cheering trying to light my team up without being out there
3208172 i always believe that ive got to win the game
3208173 because when things dont work out he gets mad at himself then he loses sight of thats one play one series let it go hes a very conscientious guy with certain goals thats a good thing but sometimes it could be bad theres a lot of pressure on him
3208174 he loses michael turner itll be interesting to see what he does without that second guy coming in for him
3208175 i couldnt believe it that tree is very important to this town its against the law to even touch it i told the man to stop it and told him to relive him self elsewhere but he told me to shove it i was shocked so i called the sheriffs office
3208176 when i got their i couldnt believe that he was still relieving him self so i walked up next to him to wait until he was finished then thats when i realized that it was old mr henderson
3208177 a bit of background the first national assessment was released in 2000 by the clinton gore administration it was a classic piece of junk science cei led by my colleague chris horner filed suit on procedural grounds that suit was settled by the bush administration in 2001 with a statement that explained that the national assessment did not represent government policy the bush administration settled a second suit filed by chris when it admitted that the national assessment had not been subjected to federal information quality act guidelines that is they admitted that it was junk science
3208178 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3208179 if i was independently wealthy and i didnt need an income i would do this for nothing thats how much i love it
3208180 they can be very dangerous animals if you dont know what youre doing
3208181 its very unlikely a person on a massage table is going to kick me
3208182 there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race
3208183 race is not based on biology but race is rather an idea that we ascribe to biology
3208184 the darwinian revolution when anthropology emerged as the science of race and how and why that viewpoint was increasingly marginalized after world war ii
3208185 it is not only appropriate but important to study race because it helps us to apply the evolutionary perspective to the analysis of human variation generally
3208186 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
3208187 these estimates of support for the two candidates show no significant change a finding that is not surprising given the attention being given to the olympics by voters the fact that obama is on vacation and the general lack of major news generating events from the presidential campaign front
3208188 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3208189 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
3208190 trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he shall make your paths straight
3208191 once we climb the tree its not about being female or male its about strength
3208192 if you or i or anyone else did this we would be arrested for criminal mischief
3208193 it was not about endorsing a negative connotation it was about getting discussion going
3208194 the law allows an owner to paint a wall any way he sees fit
3208195 the new stoner is a successful career man in a time of t j mackey the game and john edwards the successful stoner is one who can captivate women purely by making them comfortable a functioning part of the capitalist dystopia in which we now reside
3208196 his ability to capture the moment was second to none
3208197 win or lose we had a great time every day

3208203 a quarrel in a faraway country between people of which we know nothing
3208204 we the leaders of once captive nations of eastern europe and now eu and nato members estonia latvia lithuania and poland express a deep concern over the russian federations actions toward georgia
3208205 it was just interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3208206 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3208207 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3208208 in kindergarten i was told by his teacher michael cant sit still michael cant be quiet michael cant focus
3208209 senator mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here he said dismissing the notion that georgia s move into its renegade province had precipitated the crisis
3208210 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
3208211 tomorrow when georgias foreign minister arrives in brussels and possibly the nato council is convened russia will demand an extraordinary meeting of the russia nato council to present our arguments and the truth about the methods of the saakashvili regime and measures being taken by our peacekeepers
3208212 we want television screens in the west to be showing not only russian tanks and saying russia is at war in south ossetia and with georgia but also to be showing the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children the destroyed towns of south ossetia and the regional capital tskhinvali this would be an objective way of presenting the material
3208213 whether its a death sentence or a life sentence at the moment we are glad that there has been a resolution
3208214 i hope that the appeal process will be a lot quicker than the trial process
3208215 given the past track record of this matter it could be years before the appeal is heard or resolved
3208216 its only doubts that were counting on fingers broken long ago
3208217 more than a woman more than a woman to me

3208219 the move aims to better govern the military according to the law and maintain a good image of the air force with strict measures
3208220 officers would be demoted or dismissed while soldiers were to face demerit if caught driving after drinking
3208221 the important point is they havent produced for us that verification regime that we need to go forward on that issue
3208222 what we need from the north koreans is a strong verification regime thats our policy and it still stands
3208223 the process has already been protracted and so it is already clear that this administration is not going to be able to achieve its stated goal
3208224 that means that the next administration is going to inherit this problem and it may be possibly what dprk north korea had intended all along
3208225 given the maze your initial position and the cakes position you want to find the minimum number of moves needed to reach the cake if it is possible

3208246 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3208247 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3208248 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3208249 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3208250 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3208251 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3208252 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3208253 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3208254 israel has proposed building a new jewish settlement in the occupied west bank near jerusalem a spokesman for the main settlers organization said on monday
3208255 the defence ministry which oversees the issue made no comment on a move that would be seen by palestinians and by israels u s and european allies as a breach of commitments to halt settlement activity on land palestinians want for a state
3208256 the palestinians have already accused israel of bad faith during the nine month old u s sponsored annapolis peace process for approving the expansion of other settlements mostly near jerusalem and for last month giving the go ahead for an entirely new settlement in the jordan valley

3208284 obamas decision to support faith based initiatives is more so a strategic move to garner more of the conservative christian support and to fortify allegiances from african american clergy than it is to continue the programs and policies obama is working to narrow the existent gaps between himself staunch conservative christians and lingering african american hilary loyalists jesse jacksons commentary albeit tasteless and possibly divisive is reflective of how many african americans feel about obama but just are not willing to pronounce because after all obama just may be the first african american president of the united states jesse and our local grass roots civil rights activists dont need to look for another day job because their agenda is pretty much mutually exclusive to that of obama
3208285 like this ill talk to mr dean about his newest employee and youll have a little discussion with the lady herself by the way hows your italian
3208286 although i doubt that ill need it if this ms della scalla is able to get hired by an american newspaper im certain that her english is just as good
3208287 by the way how did cole find out about this portia della scalla
3208288 he met her yesterday morning here at the bay mirror
3208289 he was here with deborah mann to clean out her brothers belongings only i didnt find out until eight hours later
3208290 are you still pissed about that had it ever occurred to you that the man was simply busy i bet you must have bugged the hell out of him during your practice yesterday
3208291 paul margolin he came by to ask me out for dinner
3208292 we only had coffee before he left but were having dinner tonight
3208293 meet me upstairs when you finish with ms della scalla
3208294 are you trying to tell me that the police are suspicious of ms della scalla all because she took manns old job theyve never even met
3208295 mr dean she took over manns job in less than a week thats pretty damn quick considering that were talking about a position that would normally be difficult to fill
3208296 i had put an ad for manns old job in various magazines and papers on the same day i had learned of his death ms della scalla was simply the first to respond thats all
3208297 has it ever occurred to the police to investigate manns personal life
3208298 we already have mr dean and weve found nothing about his personal life that would lead to his murderer
3208299 and you think that ms della scalla killed him or is somewhat involved
3208300 five days mr dean she was hired five days after manns death and it took you how long less than an hour to hire her for the job tell me did she have a reputation as a well known food critic
3208301 okay so he hired ms della scalla didnt you ever wonder why mr okeefe took such a short time to hire her didnt he even bother to check her references
3208302 look i realize that youre a close friend of phoebes inspector
3208303 lieutenant excuse me i realize that youre phoebes friend and youre just doing your job but that does not give you the right to question this papers employment policy nor do you have the right to insult ms della scallas integrity shes a beau uh intelligent and decent woman who had no idea what she was getting into when she applied for the job
3208304 now if you persist with this ridiculous idea ill have you up on charges of harassment
3208305 charge me all you want mr dean you better make damn sure that im wrong about my suspicions regarding your employer if not you might find yourself in hot water over obstructing justice good day
3208306 badly he seemed insulted that the police would find his newest employee suspicious he even threatened to charge me with harassment
3208307 jason that doesnt sound like him well not quite i mean hes a bit overbearing at times but not that much
3208308 she left about a few minutes before our arrival i suspect that shes gone to see mom and bruce about the interview
3208309 dads suspicious of her so hopefully both mom and bruce will be on their guard in the meantime i ended up talking with mr okeefe who seemed downright touchy about the newest columnist almost hostile
3208310 interesting reaction to a woman whom he had neither met before yesterday i wonder what phoebe thinks of her lets find out
3208311 yeah right what do you want to know about her has cole been speaking to you
3208312 he was here with wolfies sister when jason hired that woman cole asked me to keep an eye on her said there was something odd about her
3208313 we heard about ms della scalla taking manns place on the staff and decided to investigate
3208314 we were a bit surprised to find out that she was hired not long after okeefe and jason interviewed her does she um have a reputation as a food critic or something because i can tell you right now that ive never heard of her nor has mom or bruce i asked them this morning
3208315 no ive never heard of her either and i guess that if cole is suspicious of her there might be a good reason for us to feel the same
3208316 were looking into it right now so far we havent found anything
3208317 i tried to tell your boyfriend but he gave me the brush off instead
3208318 im beginning to wonder if this della scalla woman has some kind of supernatural effect on others or that you were right about mr manns death having a magical connection
3208319 maybe i mean a part of me believe that you and cole are right its just well theres still the matter of my premonition i saw a mans hand slitting wolfies throat not a womans if this portia woman is the killer how do you explain that
3208320 i am portia della scalla of the bay mirror newspaper i have an interview with signor bruce mcneill
3208321 oh yes both he and mrs mcneill are expecting you
3208322 mr mcneill that reporter from the bay mirror is here to see you
3208323 how nice to meet you why dont you have a seat my mother should be up here any moment
3208324 the trouble with financial backing and construction we finally opened on may 28 1978 on my youngest sons first birthday
3208325 i thought your interview might be over and decided to see if you were available for lunch
3208326 barbara is my sons fianc miss della scalla the wedding is later this month
3208327 no as a pastry chef i worked here for a few years following college also my uncle was one of the bankers who had approved the loan for the restaurants construction
3208328 actually mom still pops up now and then to put some backbone into the staff
3208329 how was your lunch miss della scalla would you like a tour of the restaurant
3208330 i made it before i was hired by signor dean
3208331 perhaps we can re schedule this interview for tomorrow yes
3208332 oh one more thing i came here by taxicab could you could you give me a ride back to my office if that is not too much trouble
3208333 of course i would be more than happy to i wont actually be on duty until this evening anyway
3208334 excuse me signorina but what about your doctors appointment shouldnt you be going there instead
3208335 of course but i must go to the office first i have something to pick up
3208336 in that case bruce you might as well give me a lift to the shop as well
3208337 uh yeah the uh the last batch i had bought didnt exactly work
3208338 i thought she uh she went to lunch around 11 30
3208339 i uh i wanted to ask her a few questions about this potion im trying to create
3208340 uh yeah i still havent got that po uh sauce down pat
3208341 im sorry nick paige this is ms portia della scalla the new food columnist at the bay mirror ms della scalla this is nick manusco one of my regular customers and quite an expert on italian cuisine and this
3208342 is paige matthews my assistant i have another assistant but apparently shes out to lunch
3208343 i uh i work at an investment firm i just like to cook mainly my grandmothers italian dishes
3208344 youre italian but of course you are what part of italy does your
3208345 go for it mr uhlich you rock but please dont leave your my fav teacher
3208346 this whole genre of model programs sends a very strong message to young people that your main capacity for success in this world is to market yourself sexually
3208347 instead of being part of the solution this teacher is part of the problem
3208348 hes helping to generate these very very toxic messages that are driving young girls to body image problems and eating disorders and other psychological difficulties
3208349 its not the behaviour parents would expect from a teacher who is a role model for students under their care
3208350 the school community wishes rhys well hes a very popular teacher with the staff students and parents and we cant wait to have him back at school
3208351 i love teaching kids but i need a bit of variety in my life

3208356 i asked whats going to happen to howie goldstein when he dies
3208357 im thinking wait a minute they seem like a pretty nice family
3208358 why would god create a bunch of people and just because they have different beliefs punish them forever
3208359 the last thing i want is to make a bunch of converts to atheism
3208360 it doesnt bother me that people are religious or spiritual up until it moves them to do something that harms others
3208361 the number just keeps going up or at least the number of people willing to come out of the closet is going up
3208362 we looked a little rusty but for the first time out i am pleased with our performance
3208363 we played a very good well coached western carolina team that is primed to have a great year i thought their effort on the field was tremendous but the difference maker was our defense and that we committed to winning the ball in the attacking third

3208388 its a very clear and known means for people to flee persecution in their country of origin
3208389 obviously were aware that there are pilgrims out there who have been given three month visas and so it might well be at the end of those three months we see a spike in applications for protection

3208448 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3208449 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3208450 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3208451 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3208452 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3208453 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values he told the people of nh yesterday he has a kansas accent because his mother was from there his mother lived in many states as far as we can tell but this is an example of the nonsense he uses to cover this up
3208454 how we could give some life to this contrast without turning negative every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today values of fairness compassion responsibility giving back lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3208455 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3208456 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3208457 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3208458 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3208459 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3208460 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3208461 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3208462 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3208463 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3208464 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3208465 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3208466 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3208467 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3208468 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3208469 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3208470 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3208471 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3208472 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3208473 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3208474 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3208475 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3208476 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3208477 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3208478 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3208479 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3208480 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3208482 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3208483 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3208484 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3208488 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3208489 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3208490 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3208491 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3208492 just for the fact that i havent even played a d i down yet this is a lot i just feel very blessed

3208502 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3208503 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3208504 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3208505 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3208506 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3208507 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3208508 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3208510 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3208511 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

3208524 state elections systems have shown signs of stress and theres a serious concern that they wont be able to handle the number of voters
3208525 when you get so many new registrations like that at record numbers its very difficult for people to monitor the validity of it
3208526 the most comprehensive voter protection program in our nations history
3208527 we dont have a real history in the last 10 to 15 years of large scale voter fraud
3208528 what we do have a problem with is getting everyone on the rolls and making sure their votes are counted
3208529 state and local parties have the primary responsibility for monitoring local voter registration and identifying problems
3208530 our view is that advance monitoring of legal developments can avoid real legal problems later on especially on election day
3208531 were all for getting people involved in the process and getting them to the polls
3208532 what were not for is registering fake people at fake addresses and creating barriers to trying to identify voter fraud where it exists which is everywhere its a growing problem because of the professional vote fraud denier industry

3208540 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3208541 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3208542 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3208543 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3208544 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3208545 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3208546 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3208547 critics of the administration have every reason to be wary of charter change especially since this has always been tied to maneuvers to keep arroyo in power beyond 2010 there is nothing in the track record of this government which says it can be trusted with amending the constitution
3208548 the ensuing armed tension from the impasse in the signing may have also been a calculated risk by the regime so that it could play the federalism via charter change card the escalation of hostilities puts pressure on congress to adopt changes in the constitution
3208549 arroyos resurrection of charter change deserves the peoples outrage thats one way of stopping this ambitious brutal and corrupt politician in malaca ang
3208550 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3208551 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3208552 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today
3208553 the presidential candidate would obviously like her to say this is just the greatest person in the world and ive seen the error of my ways and you should vote for him
3208554 but the other candidate may have other motives and sour feelings
3208555 with bill we dont ever know what hes going to do and he feels more attacked and unfairly treated than she does
3208556 the worst thing he could say is that youre nominating the wrong person and that well be back in four years
3208557 its hard to put that kind of race behind you but it sets me up for something good tomorrow

3208594 you believed in me when no one else could see
3208595 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
3208596 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
3208597 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
3208598 desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity

3208631 olympic gold medalist and outspoken darfur activist joey cheek has had
3208632 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur cheek was going to china to support the athletes on team darfur including soccer player abby wambach and to promote the cause one that he has championed for years after winning gold in the torino games cheek announced he was donating his 25 000 usoc bonus to darfur and implored his sponsors to do the same it seems that joey cheek is truly one of the good guys and now hes out of china before he even got there with the games getting closer just two days away now the world seemed ready to forget about all the chinese issues in order to focus on the games themselves unfortunately chinas actions make that impossible in a time when we should be wondering who will light the olympic cauldron whether liu xiang will react to the pressure of 1 3 billion of his countrymen hanging on his every step were instead left to discuss the chinese governments reluctance to allow any dissension in their country despite repeated promises that theyd clean up their act when the olympics came to town

3208715 its like im totally not in love with you anymore tommy i mean its so boring
3208716 im not in the mood to go to the valley
3208717 you know tommys going to look real good after six groddie bus rides in hollywood
3208718 it was a joke it just goes to show that the american public loves to celebrate the infantile i mean i dont want people to act like that i think valley girls are disgusting
3208719 wayne crawford and andy lane had this great script which reminded me of romeo and juliet and i came in and said ive really got to differentiate the valley from hollywood because there really is a kind of spiritual difference one being more urban and more hardcore and the other being more suburban and put in the scene where they fell in love and put in the scene where they break up those two scenes werent in the picture
3208720 almost everything was made with one take the most was three it was a movie i had no extra film so we had to really be ready and really do it right when we did it
3208721 false designation of origin unfair competition and dilution of trademark
3208722 he did have something to do with creating the fad but the song did not create the persona
3208723 this movie was made with a lot of love a lot of generosity enormous number of people worked free and those that were paid were basically working for free it was a chance for everyone and all the crew members to make a movie that they were proud of and that really depicted a time certain time in history which we had all loved and participated in and i knew that movies do preserve the culture that we live in and i think that this movie has really shown that
3208724 before john hughes became the auteur of mature teen angst cage and foremans romance had a reputation as the best the genre had to offer a title that rightly should have gone to fast times at ridgemont high valley girl holds up pretty well thanks to cage some anthropologically valuable shots of shopping malls and the sunset strip and the sensitive illustration of adolescent self consciousness provided by director martha coolidge it almost doesnt matter that cage and foremans differences seem ridiculously slight what matters is that they feel like theyre being judged
3208725 valley girl is one of those quintessential 80s flicks that actually stands up pretty well over time and thats because it isnt really about valley speak or hot trends although theres plenty of that in the mix its about two people that want to be together even though everyone tells them they cant and the agony that all of this implies its probably not the deepest or most profound telling of this oft utilized theme but it didnt need to be as purely an entertainment piece the unique blend of music wardrobe and kooky characters sets it apart enough to have its own special flavor

3208744 grave mistake in appointing such a polarizing controversial figure to the highest ranking position in the school department
3208745 it was peter who first promoted mario cirillo to principal and then to assistant superintendent of schools
3208746 peter calls mario an outstanding educator a real leader and says mario works hard peter says he has tremendous respect for mario and that hed be terrific in east providence
3208747 first the responsibility for hiring superintendents of schools rests with the school committee which evaluated candidates and chose dr
3208748 found a politically charged atmosphere and a teachers union whose senior officials were used to getting their own way child centered personnel decisions such as reassigning a teacher to a school with increased enrollment were met with militant opposition
3208749 they soon began urging his ouster and recruited a few school committee and town council members to their cause dr cirillo continued to push for change and succeeded in much despite the union hostility as for charges of overspending the record shows surpluses and the lower test scores they improved or remained constant and administrative salary increases were standard and limited to 2 percent per year
3208750 yes he has a right to his opinion but lets get the conflicts of interest out on the table school superintendents who have the temerity to stand up to the teachers unions are not popular with the labor union movement no surprise there
3208751 a leader who puts the kids first and a manager who can attain standards of excellence at a cost our city can afford
3208752 what impossible those liberal crusaders would be in a heavy froth over language used that could only be described as hate at least its enough grounds for a hate charge in order to let a human rights court determine whether such statements are or are not legally hate how could these liberal missionaries miss this

3208756 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players

3208830 n o pensem que eu tive qualquer tipo de mudan a na minha decis o que completamente irrevers vel mas eu n o tenho certeza se o meu cora o vasca no consegue suportar uma coisa dessas por isso estou fazendo esse apelo mas n o pensem que com isso eu volte nada cada dia se consolida mais essa decis o que eu tomei esse um outro vasco e eu prefiro levar comigo nos anos que eu ficar do meu vasco n o quero participar de outro vasco
3208831 mas tenho a obriga o de fazer esse alerta essa conclama o a voc s que s o mais jovens voc s s o absolutamente capazes para induzir a que outros pensem da mesma forma e eu tenho absoluta certeza do que eu estou falando se n o tomar essa medida de imediato o vasco ir para a segunda divis o
3208832 eu pedi tamb m ao presidente do conselho de benem ritos que efetivamente promovesse uma reuni o de benem ritos at porque o conselho de benem ritos n o pode ficar omisso numa situa o dessas a informa o que eu tenho que ia ter um contato com a diretoria do vasco e levar essa preocupa o n o queriam causar qualquer perturba o nessa semana de anivers rio do vasco o vasco comemora no pr ximo dia 21 110 anos mas que convocaria essa reuni o t o logo passasse o dia 21 que o que eu espero que fa a apesar de eu achar que j est sendo tarde isso tinha que acontecer o mais r pido poss vel mas como diz o ditado antes mais tarde do que nunca
3208833 talk like a retard for a few hours after its done
3208834 lets try to have a conversation with the guy with a bunch of shit in his mouth
3208835 so what kind of systems are they unix or whats that other type of system thats like unix but its free for everyone
3208836 everything has been building to this moment it is our chance to shine
3208837 china and the u s are the class of the world
3208838 they are the top two and theyre sure to fight it out for most of the gold medals
3208839 we got all of our jitters out of the way early
3208840 it gives us something that will motivate us and push to be even stronger
3208841 ill just get a six pack and bring it home
3208842 food is given to the labourer as to a mere means of production as coal is supplied to the boiler grease and oil to the machinery
3208843 i dont see america having problems i see america as a nation that is a world leader that has got great values and leverage i dont think you should look at the relationship as one of leverage
3208844 well first of all if you are a religious person you understand that once religion takes hold in a society it cant be stopped
3208845 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3208846 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3208847 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3208848 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3208849 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
3208850 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
3208851 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
3208852 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
3208853 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3208854 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3208855 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals

3208858 as under the russians in chechnya it looks like the communists in china are battling another form of totalitarianism to come jihadism
3208859 china will continue to pursue a policy of support to other jihadist forces including the islamist regime in khartoum
3208860 a new afghanistan with jihadists converging from central asia and other parts of the world
3208861 a turkistan islamist movement with links in central asia stretching back to afghanistan and pakistan blending taliban training
3208862 is a very different entity than china has faced in the past
3208863 beijing would be unable to use information from raiding one cell to find another this appears to be exactly what we are seeing now the central tip core uses the internet and videos as psychological tools to trigger a reaction from beijing and inspire militants without exposing itself to detection or capture
3208864 the alleged activities seem to fit a pattern within the international jihadist movement of paying more attention to china islamists have considered china something less imperialistic and thus less threatening than the united states and european powers but this began changing with the launch of the sco designed to monitor terrorism in russian and asia and the trend has been accelerating with chinas expanded involvement in africa and central asia and its continued support for pakistans government
3208865 opportunistically using the post 11 september environment to make the outrageous claim that individuals disseminating peaceful religious and cultural messages in xinjiang are terrorists who have simply changed tactics
3208866 they dont espouse violence they espouse sharia does china want to live under sharia do free people want to live under sharia does it matter that hizb ut tahrir wont be blowing anyone up on its way to instituting this oppressive system
3208867 the beijing games are our one last golden opportunity to inflict such attacks on china even though we know we are weak like an egg on a stone we will try to smear the stone

3208871 need to focus on the consequences which you can know rather than the probability which you cant know
3208872 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3208873 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3208874 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3208875 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3208876 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3208877 i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on
3208878 the one guys loyalty and passion over there i dont question is his i think we have eliminated any and all excuses now no one can point any fingers
3208879 we respect cobi hes stepping in and filling a void whether or not cobis comfortable being the head coach or whether or not he has the experience well play that one by ear cobi certainly will have a voice in this
3208880 that said well see where we go with the head coaching position
3208881 i dont think were going to mandate or dictate that
3208882 we certainly could make a quick decision if thats whats necessary my guess is a lot of people will want to throw their name in the ring here
3208883 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start
3208884 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start

3208916 yo considero el laicismo radical como un origen de nueva religi n pero defiendo el laicismo moderado en cuanto a lo que s que puede haber contradicci n es en cuanto a las posiciones sociales del profesor bueno en el a o 89 se puede intuir una defensa del predominio del bien com n c vico y en el 07 se ve un claro posicionamiento a favor de las creencias por encima de las necesidades c vias o sociales
3208917 1 a el asunto desde luego no es si la escuela p blica puede servir a las necesidades proselitistas de la iglesia cat lica sino si debe que puede parece claro ahora bien el problema es que de las declaraciones de bueno de 1989 parece derivarse una respuesta negativa a esa cuesti n de la entrevista del 2007 justo la contraria

3208923 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3208924 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3208925 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3208926 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3208927 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3208928 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3208929 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3208930 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3208931 there are other benefits such as forwarding messages and archiving messages but the primary one is easier immediate access to the voicemail and being able to see who called and when they call and picking and choosing whose voicemail you want to get first rather than in the order it was received

3208961 its time to put a stop to all the crime you cant sleep at night because people are shooting and you want to know where the bullet is going to go next
3208962 to curtail some of the general mayhem weve been experiencing particularly the gun shots
3208963 nobody can walk down the street and be safe that is be free from police interference
3208964 they know exactly whos doing the shooting the robbery but it seems like were never going to get any justice around here
3208965 we got kids down here they should lock up these young folks that have been doing the shooting dont put us hostage or on lockdown

3208967 u s approves georgias aggression against south ossetia and russia
3208968 we must immediately call a meeting of the nato council to estimate georgias security and consider the measures which nato may take to stabilize the highly dangerous situation
3208969 the international community needs to deploy independent and neutral peacemaking forces in south ossetia russia must immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw troops from the sovereign territory of georgia
3208970 rep ron paul the us is heading into an illegal attack on iran
3208971 if we do attack it is going to be a disaster
3208972 i was astounded to see on one of the networks the other day that the debate was not are we going to attack but are we going to attack before or after the election
3208973 if that comes up it is demanding that the president put in place an absolute blockade of the entire country of iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with iran
3208974 video shows police punching teen 13 times in face then tasering him
3208975 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
3208976 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough
3208977 that makes it clear that the targets of the russian military were not only georgian economic objects but international objects on georgian territory
3208978 there are white folks and then there are ignorant motherf ckers like you
3208979 thats the only way to cure an illness right diagnose it

3208986 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3208987 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3208988 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3208989 women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea

3208994 people like me arent meant to win the lottery it will never happen
3208995 his political base has cracked and his domestic support is dwindling
3208996 p ublic opinion in georgia already pins the blame on saakashvili for the folly and loss of the ossetian adventure
3208997 the strategy of georgias president mikheil saakashvili is to globalize the conflict and turn it into a central front of a new struggle between moscow and the west
3208998 if senseless bloodshed is to be stopped and peace is to be restored to the caucasus western and us leaders will have to activate several additional brain cells and stop mindlessly repeating the meaningless phrase georgias territorial integrity
3208999 councilman kenneth stokes said he wants to get guns off the streets he claimed too many people buy guns from pawn shops hes hoping to ban those stores from selling firearms stokes said he may bring up the idea in the next council meeting as an emergency item

3209046 federal police are scaling up their capacities in the fight against kidnappings with an unprecedented effort
3209047 were proposing a pact a national agreement that sets certain rules and commitments from each of the people involved
3209048 theres no evidence that the increase in kidnappings is related to

3209055 we are basically seeing the cold blooded preplanned premeditated murder of a small country
3209056 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of no where
3209057 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3209058 there is no question that georgia started this conflict with an offensive against the separatists of south ossetia because its entry to nato required a resolution to the problem but the disproportionate and continuing military attacks by russia appears to have united the european union and the u s in a call for the removal of russian troops
3209059 the fighting has now created a major refugee crisis that is spilling over to regional states
3209060 and a political crisis with fears that russia is trying to overthrow the democratically elected pro western government of georgia
3209061 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then

3209074 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3209079 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3209080 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3209081 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3209082 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales

3209085 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3209086 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3209087 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3209088 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3209089 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3209090 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3209091 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3209092 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3209111 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3209112 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3209117 he who loves the beautiful is called a lover because he partakes of it
3209118 things that cause friendship are doing kindnesses doing them unasked and not proclaiming the fact when they are done
3209119 since his purpose is to contemplate worthy actions to live pleasantly sharing in discussion and thought
3209120 in all friendships implying inequality the love also should be proportional i e the better should be more loved than he loves
3209121 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
3209122 one cannot be a friend to many people in the sense of having friendship of the perfect type with them just as one cannot be in love with many people at once for love is a sort of excess of feeling and it is the nature of such only to be felt towards one person
3209123 love itself bringing about the continuous emergence of ever higher value in the object just as if it were streaming out from the object of its own accord without any exertion even of wishing on the part of the lover
3209124 look at how he dotes upon his flowers he must love them
3209125 shouldnt be relying on a government penalty to attract customers they should be offering attractive affordable policies
3209126 mr kalisch made the point a point i have made many times that many of the claims by insurance companies and others about the impact this might have on premiums are vastly exaggerated
3209127 he also made the point that there are a range of complex factors that drive premium growth the fact is that if the insurance companies produce attractive affordable policies then people will continue to buy them
3209128 any premium increases will have to be approved by the commonwealth and i have made clear to the insurance companies that i will not accept their attempts to use this as an excuse to hike premiums

3209140 i think the difference between xm and sirius wasnt really there to begin with
3209141 lisa and i are very excited with the overall athleticism and fitness level that our kids have shown over the last two days we had almost 70 percent of our kids pass every fitness test we have had new personal and team records set in our fitness testing and today when we had a chance to get out and knock the ball around there was much better quality soccer being played
3209142 a lot of individuals both newcomers and returners are stepping up and showing some real talent and ability
3209143 we are excited and believe we will be able to achieve some great goals this year
3209144 coach pittman did a good job of recruiting this freshman class
3209145 there are not many weaknesses in this class and that is a huge bright spot for us as a team it is just the first day and we have some chemistry already that we lacked last year last year was better than the year before and i think we will continue building this season
3209146 we are coming together as a team and trying to build unity
3209147 we are having fun with soccer but taking things seriously and trying to build our program
3209148 i have been really happy with the way the upperclassmen have adapted to 13 new faces
3209149 when you have 13 newcomers on a 22 player roster you never know what the dynamics are going to be and they have done a great job so far so far the attitude and enthusiasm have been great across the board
3209150 sometimes you dont stay in that mentality after you have an off day and it takes a jump start to get them going but we came back today and focused real well tonight we did a lot more team drills than weve been doing in practice and i thought we picked up some things pretty well
3209151 there have been a lot of things that i have been really pleased with
3209152 a lot of young guys have come in and picked things up fairly well our effort has been outstanding and our leadership has been good
3209153 we got a lot of work done on some special teams areas where it was almost live it was the first time we have been able to do that we were real pleased with the effort all through practice in the second half of practice we got a little bit tired and winded but overall it was not a bad practice
3209154 we had a much better two a days than our first day of two a days
3209155 i was real proud of the way we attacked practice this morning and then got a lot accomplished tonight obviously the weather is unreal for this time of year it was great to get out here and get some work done and i thought we were very productive on our live drills
3209156 third and long is a tough situation to be in and hopefully we wont find ourselves in that situation very often defensively weve got to get off the field on 3rd and long and offensively weve got to make a few plays on 3rd and long to keep them honest i thought we did that especially early in the competition we started out very strong

3209165 one of the attributes the next mca president should have is the ability to speak out for the
3209166 i do solemnly swear to the best of my ability to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
3209167 i have a constitutional right to fill in the blank
3209168 i would look for justices of the supreme court who understand that our constitution is a living and breathing document that it was intended by our founders to be interpreted in the light of the constantly evolving experience of the american people
3209169 we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america
3209170 had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the congress been found in the constitution than the general expressions just cited the authors of the objection might have had some color for it though it would have been difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an authority to legislate in all possible cases
3209171 but what color can the objection have when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon if the different parts of the same instrument ought to be so expounded as to give meaning to every part which will bear it shall one part of the same sentence be excluded altogether from a share in the meaning and shall the more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent and the clear and precise expressions be denied any signification whatsoever for what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars
3209172 but the idea of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning and can have no other effect than to confound and mislead is an absurdity which as we are reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection or on the authors of the constitution we must take the liberty of supposing had not its origin with the latter
3209173 you will have learned that an act for internal improvement after passing both houses was negatived by the president

3209176 indahnya kawin sesama jenis demokratisasi dan perlindungan hak hak kaum homoseksual
3209177 karena keinginan untuk menikahkan putrinya tidak kesampaian tentu luth amat kecewa luth kemudian menganggap kedua laki laki tersebut tidak normal istri luth bisa memahami keadaan laki laki tersebut dan berusaha menyadarkan luth tapi oleh luth malah dianggap istri yang melawan suami dan dianggap mendukung kedua laki laki yang dinilai oleh luth tidak normal kenapa luth menilai buruk terhadap kedua laki laki yang kebetulan homo tersebut sejauh yang saya tahu al quran tidak memberi jawaban yang jelas tetapi kebencian luth terhadap kaum homo di samping karena faktor kecewa karena tidak berhasil menikahkan kedua putrinya juga karena anggapan luth yang salah terhadap kaum homo
3209178 luth yang mengecam orientasi seksual sesama jenis mengajak orang orang di kampungnya untuk tidak mencintai sesama jenis tetapi ajakan luth ini tidak digubris mereka berangkat dari kekecewaan inilah kemudian kisah bencana alam itu direkayasa istri luth seperti cerita al quran ikut jadi korban dalam al quran maupun injil homoseksual dianggap sebagai faktor utama penyebab utama dihancurkannya kaum luth tapi ini perlu dikritisi saya menilai bencana alam tersebut ya bencana alam biasa sebagaimana gempa yang terjadi di beberapa wilayah sekarang namun karena pola pikir masyarakat dulu sangat tradisional dan mistis lantas bencana alam tadi dihubung hubungkan dengan kaum luth ini tidak rasional dan terkesan mengada ngada masa hanya faktor orang yang homo kemudian terjadi bencana alam
3209179 mengapa kamu mengerjakan perbuatan keji itu yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorang pun di dunia ini sebelummu
3209180 sesungguhnya kamu telah tahu bahwa kami tidak mempunyai keinginan terhadap putri putrimu dan sesungguhnya kamu tentu mengetahui apa yang sebenarnya kami kehendaki
3209181 seandainya aku ada mempunyai kekuatan untuk menolakmu atau kalau aku dapat berlindung kepada keluarga yang kuat tentu aku lakukan
3209182 luth adalah putra harun bin azar beliau adalah keponakan nabi ibrahim luth ini orang yang beriman bersama nabi ibrahim lalu keduanya pergi hijrah ke negeri syam selanjutnya alloh mengutusnya agar mendakwahi kaum saddum dan daerah sekelilingnya beliau menyeru mereka untuk beribadah kepada alloh memerintahkan yang maruf dan mencegah ke mungkaran yang mereka kerjakan juga perbuatan keji homoseksual yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorang pun sebelumnya yaitu laki laki berbuat seksual terhadap laki laki setelah mendengarkan dakwah luth mereka bukannya menerima dakwah tetapi malah mengusir nabi luth agar keluar dari negerinya lalu nabi luth keluar dan alloh menghancurkan negerinya dengan dibalik lalu mereka diadzab dengan adzab yang pedih berupa batu yang sangat panas
3209183 para sahabat sepakat bahwa orang yang melakukan perbuatan yang dilakukan oleh kaum luth itu dibunuh tidak ada perselisihan satu pun di antara mereka mereka hanya berselisih tentang bagaimana cara membunuhnya namun ada sebagian orang yang menyangka apakah pelakunya dibunuh atau tidak lalu dia menganggapnya sebagai sebuah masalah yang masih diperselisihkan padahal sebenarnya ini adalah masalah yang disepakati oleh mereka

3209213 existing technical legal environmental and other risks relating to the trans caspian project are so great that it would be impossible to find an investor
3209214 unless this is a political project and then it does not matter what would be inside the pipeline as long as it exists
3209215 if these claims are substantiated and if the turkmens find investors to produce this gas the possibility of the trans caspian pipeline remains on the table
3209216 if politicians really have a strong desire to get more gas that would bypass russia they could offer to incur some financial losses and risks
3209217 we take our responsibility in the world energy supply very seriously
3209218 this pipeline is of strategic importance not only to azerbaijan but to the other new independent states as well
3209219 this is a reliable way to the world markets take turkmenistan with its huge resources of natural gas and no access to the world markets as a result the turkmens have to sell their gas 2 5 times cheaper than the world price
3209220 the new conduit stands to severely weaken russias grip on regional energy exports
3209221 bp will use all means at its disposal both inside and outside of russia to defend its interests and rights
3209222 in the light of uncertainties surrounding the status of my work visa and the sustained harassment of the company and myself i have decided to leave and to work outside russia temporarily
3209223 in addition to the much publicised dispute between shareholders the company and i have faced unprecedented investigations proceedings inquiries and other burdens

3209230 they say if you talk to someone in your head for more than 20 minutes a day youre in love with them
3209231 never ending so it is fantastic to win the leg i really had to focus hard on this leg and i realised i could win it 10 miles from the finish and just dug deeper and deeper to get here what is funny is that nico financo wins the first leg and gets the 1st in the overall ranking gildas cercle vert wins the second leg and gets second overall and i win the third leg and take third place overall
3209232 i am really really happy i really had to look for this one i pushed and pushed and pushed never giving up i just had to follow each little wind shift i can tell you that this leg was much harder than it looked the upwind beat was incredibly long and hard i think the hardest in my life psychologically you had to stay on top of things
3209233 it is funny nicolas troussel wins the first leg and is going to win the general gildas morvan wins the second leg and is going to be second and then i win the third and am going to be third overall
3209234 when i reached the livinter plateau well really about 10 miles before the finish line when we lowered the spinnaker just then it was so close and so tough on the whole leg i could see gildas morvan and laurent pellecuer just behind me and they were chasing me down but i kept between them both to mark them so unless something broke i was able to mark them and keep ahead i just kept going to the finish
3209235 yes it did a bit it was a long windward leeward the longest i have ever done playing tactics up to a mark that is 2 miles away i can generally do but then over 300 miles is something else
3209236 spirit of 76 am radio the first radio station i found and probably the only one the little transistor radio could receive was
3209237 went straight to nowhere until the title cut written by conlee was released which made conlee a star
3209238 the song about a cotton farmer for whom every conceivable thing has gone wrong
3209239 in which a man struggles to cope with the loss of his love
3209240 written in an asylum by a man whom love drove insane
3209241 about the temptation a man faces and overcomes when encountering his ex girlfriend at his class reunion
3209242 spirit of 76 radio and i still listen to john conlee
3209243 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3209244 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3209245 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3209246 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3209247 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3209248 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3209249 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3209250 the line was so long i was like what is this
3209251 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3209252 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3209253 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3209254 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3209255 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3209256 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3209257 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3209258 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3209259 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3209260 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3209261 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3209262 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3209263 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3209264 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3209265 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3209266 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3209267 wireless devices need not always be about getting things done
3209268 the important point is they havent produced for us that verification regime that we need to go forward on that issue
3209269 what we need from the north koreans is a strong verification regime thats our policy and it still stands
3209270 the process has already been protracted and so it is already clear that this administration is not going to be able to achieve its stated goal
3209271 that means that the next administration is going to inherit this problem and it may be possibly what dprk north korea had intended all along
3209272 we have to wrap up the question of qualification to the group stage at home
3209273 artmedia are a team that score a lot but we are solid at the back and im not worried

3209280 2008 will be the bottom year for builders in orange county
3209281 emotionally ready to be a homeowner you have good credit plan to stay put for five years and have been waiting for the perfect entry point its time to get serious before an inevitable rise in interest rates wipes out your advantage
3209282 price fixing in this market selling a home requires savvy
3209283 round numbers signal prestige while precise numbers suggest a bargain buyers anchor off the first digit so 3 999 seems cheaper than 4 000
3209284 if you cut your asking price make it easy to calculate the discount
3209285 it was very cold at 5am and made it hard for the swimmers so we had to go to plan b which was to carry on swimming and forfeit the record attempt

3209294 theyre a little tired a little leg weary and beat up hamstrings are sore and all that but thats the way its supposed to be at this point
3209295 we moved the ball well i thought we pursued well and tackled well it wasnt bad of course im never satisfied i was particularly pleased with the tackling were running to the ball well and were tackling thats a good thing for our defense we moved the ball well but we made some critical errors in the red zone and we were a good red zone team last year so we want to continue that but we want to be able to get more explosive plays
3209296 i think every team is different but we are going to demand more out of this group i expect to get it and were going to find out who is willing to give it
3209297 i walked down this one aisle of chickens and one of them went roh ah roh ah roh and then another one responded and then another one and another one and then they stopped for a minute until another one of them started in crowing what was your favorite part
3209298 i also liked the shetland sheep they were so cute and all fuzzy with the little feet just like a cartoon sheep
3209299 what did you get at the fair i didnt see you buy anything
3209300 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his stripes we are healed
3209301 for christ also suffered once for sins the righteous for the unrighteous that he might bring us to god
3209302 he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
3209303 in this is love not that we have loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
3209304 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son purifies us from all sin
3209305 you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers not with perishable things such as silver or gold but with the precious blood of christ like that of a lamb without blemish or spot
3209306 and you who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh god made alive together with him having forgiven us all our trespasses by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands this he set aside nailing it to the cross he disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame by triumphing over them in him
3209307 a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in jesus christ so we also have believed in christ jesus in order to be justified by faith in christ and not by works of the law because by works of the law no one will be justified
3209308 for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
3209309 for there is one god and there is one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself as a ransom
3209310 christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps
3209311 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all malice be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as god in christ forgave you therefore be imitators of god as beloved children and walk in love as christ loved us and gave himself up for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god
3209312 no one has ever seen god the only god who is at the fathers side he has made him known
3209313 yet it was the will of the lord to crush him he has put him to grief
3209314 this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you greater love has no one than this that someone lays down his life for his friends
3209315 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
3209316 but god shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
3209317 in this the love of god was made manifest among us that god sent his only son into the world so that we might live through him in this is love not that we have loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
3209318 the fact that piney creek leads into such a significant area were dealing with fishing in the entire delta this species can threaten many of our native fish

3209333 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3209334 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours
3209335 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values

3209342 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3209343 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as
3209344 focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3209345 now total approximately 65 1 million high speed internet subscribers those 20 providers make up roughly 94 percent of the u s broadband market
3209346 net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years lrg has been tracking the industry
3209347 35 of dial up users say that the price of broadband service would have to fall

3209352 they solve their symptoms they make them feel good and they essentially want to stay on them forever because once they go off them acid reflux returns
3209353 there may be patients who have very mild symptoms of heartburn who while they get relief from these medications may find they get equally good relief with less aggressive medications
3209354 i get the pains in my bones i can feel the bone pain

3209361 jack travels to iraq he has friends in iraq and because of his many connections jack sees things in iraq that a lot of us dont get to see
3209362 881 has got the getai as the main focus and is the

3209364 erm no lah thats not what i wanted to say it should be
3209365 but im a little worried for the people who are back in tibet under chinese rule
3209366 it really highlights what the chinese authorities are willing to do to silence people
3209367 some of the measures i think are a bit excessive but probably some it is understandable the nervousness of the authorities they dont know whats going to happen
3209368 i hope one day ill be able to visit a free tibet
3209369 the participants demonstrated a perception that not having to attach receipts to the return creates a temptation for electronic filers to overstate their claims for deductions and credits
3209370 there is no need to supply receipts so sometimes people may think they can get away with it without getting caught
3209371 the underestimating part could be more forgetting or not adding things up properly or maybe theyre not sure they have all their information
3209372 they believed they would not be caught as long as the overstatements were relatively small
3209373 i would recommend people who think they can get away with this to not try it
3209374 when you file a paper return there is a process you have to follow but when you file online you push a button and it goes
3209375 while crematories themselves are generally regulated as they are in georgia the cremation process itself is not
3209376 i havent found any study that is exactly on point to our crematory issue here
3209377 the bottom line is that there is the potential for pollution with this crematory
3209378 what man is going to get excited about this post three babies body
3209379 on behalf of the united states attorneys office i commend law enforcement and their vigorous pursuit of mr nowak targeting a government official with death for simply doing ones job is an outrage and law enforcements response was swift and decisive
3209380 the treasury inspector general for tax administration works aggressively to protect irs employees from individuals who seek to impair the integrity of tax administration by threatening harm or committing violent acts
3209381 the fbi considers threats of violence against united states government employees due to their enforcement and or investigative activities very serious matters and this case is a good example of our commitment to aggressively pursuing those responsible
3209382 i stay focused on my highest priorities and dont worry about what isnt getting done since its not my highest priority
3209383 i relieve my stress by exercising every morning i also make sure my assistant schedules me in a hotel with an excellent fitness center when im on the road i stayed at a westin last week that had a treadmill in the room
3209384 spending time with my family including weekends at our second home on the lake helps me unwind its good to be in a different environment away from the everyday hustle and bustle

3209386 its your stubborn love that never lets go of me i dont understand how it could be perfect love embracing the worst in me its your stubborn love
3209387 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3209388 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3209389 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3209390 if you do something on purpose not by accident you do it purposely but if you have a specific purpose in mind you are acting purposefully
3209391 today is the day you have made i will rejoice and be glad in it i will rejoice and be glad in it today is the day you have made i will rejoice and be glad in it and i wont worry about tomorrow im trusting in what you say today is the day
3209392 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3209393 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3209394 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3209395 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3209396 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3209397 peace be with you as the father has sent me i am sending you

3209435 the perceived influence of the councilperson lends credibility and was effective with these seniors
3209436 isnt this a conflict of interest for an elected official who serves in a fiduciary role to be visiting homes of petitioners who opposed this project
3209437 she made no negative comments about this project however she did make positive comments
3209438 it is wrong an elected representative would use their position to aid a developer in removing names from a petition
3209439 one has to wonder what was in it for ms schratz
3209440 my neighbors on both sides of me made deals with rubino taking money and took their names off the petition
3209441 it was wrong to show up at anyones door to help a developer
3209442 we did not elect any of you to lobby for any developer
3209443 a petition with the signatures of people against the rubino development has vanished
3209444 it would take einstein to figure out what everything meant
3209445 this type of bookkeeping was not the standard of mrs jaros or her staff
3209446 i have to question what the people signed at their homes when the rubino brothers shelly schratz visited them
3209447 shelly said she did speak to four of the people whose names were on the petition voting
3209448 interestingly the four people she spoke with did remove their names from the petition sheets
3209449 she said her purpose in going out to the area was to help some people who were having trouble with their land
3209450 what shelly did was sell out her name to help a developer she should be removed from the town board now

3209469 they were in a night training mission wearing night vision goggles and they needed to have those towers marked because that would have been reflected in the night vision goggles
3209470 i just thought it was an accident and accidents happen and thats all there is to it when i found out that if there had been lights on the tower we would not be here talking today
3209471 to this day sdg amp e has not marked that area

3209473 despu s del resultado est claro que se debe tener concertaci n pol tica los n meros preliminares muestran que seis de cada 10 bolivianos le han dicho al gobierno que continu concluya su mandato y tambi n a los prefectos principalmente aquellos que han defendido la causa auton mica
3209474 es muy desequilibrado esa es una situaci n un escenario que puede ser usado para fomentar el enfrentamiento la divisi n racial la divisi n regional
3209475 todos los bolivianos queremos m s inversi n m s producci n m s generaci n de empleo que se controle la inflaci n que dejen de subir los precios y esa es una responsabilidad que tiene ahora el gobierno no creo que con ayudas d divas o pr stamos de venezuela se pueda ir muy lejos nosotros estamos prestos a ayudar en todo lo que sea necesario

3209481 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
3209482 university teachers should simply accept as variant spellings those words our students most commonly misspell
3209483 to celebrate the first of what im sure will be
3209484 a presidents pension currently is 191 300 per year until he is 80 years old
3209485 therefore it would certainly make economic sense to elect mccain in november
3209486 sometimes it helps us if the criminals arent too smart
3209487 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3209488 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3209489 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3209490 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3209491 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3209492 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3209493 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3209494 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3209495 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work

3209502 we need to offer these kids something that they can do and music is free were having a lot of bands donate their time a lot of these downtown business owners are donating their time and their efforts and hopefully it will be a good thing
3209503 in many cases youre dealing with public healthcare facilities where they would be looking at a significant impact and that would mean they would have to be addressing some cuts that in turn would mean less services for people and higher costs
3209504 taxing people in this state has to be a last resort were losing heavy population and people from having done that in the past
3209505 we have always said to any candidate dont take our endorsement for granted its all about not only the long term relationship that we have with people but also what happens even in the short run

3209509 the civil society partners of the dar were given all the opportunities to penetrate the state agrarian reform apparatus get into alliances with national and local dar bureaucrats and use legal and extralegal political action to assert and seek favorable resolution of issues concerns and interests
3209510 not all the agrarian reform partners fully utilized this opening
3209511 when reforms do not move as fast it is easy to accuse government of lacking political will and sincerity and other pejorative terms in the civil society cookbook in many cases reforms do not move too fast because social pressure from the constituency is weak many have the mistaken notion that press releases and letters to the editor constitute sufficient social pressure p easant social mobilizations complemented by friendly media is support is a more effective combination state reforms are rarely won by state reformists alone they are won when the alliance between autonomous peasant organizations and state reformists is much stronger than whatever coalition of the anti reformists within and outside government can mount
3209512 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3209513 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3209514 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3209515 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3209516 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3209517 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3209518 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3209519 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3209520 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3209521 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3209522 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3209523 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3209524 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3209525 whether the future with the congress will be in youtube or in twitter or in some other technology i think those type of technologies are where its going to be

3209536 he was wearing blue school pants a white and blue chequered shirt and his school jacket
3209537 if anyone has seen him just bring him back please
3209538 you often see those things in the papers happening in sydney and the bigger cities but to happen in their own backyard is very concerning to residents
3209539 it strikes anywhere and obviously to strike down here has been a great shock
3209540 but its maybe a bit of a wake up call for communities to think yes were not quite as safe as we think we are and we have to be more diligent and look after one another
3209541 the worst punishment for someone that mean is to have to live inside their own head
3209542 if you dont have something good to say dont say anything at all

3209556 im going to ask everybody for their patience because with a little pain theres a lot of gain to acquire
3209557 my experience has been kids are more adaptable i think the kids will do just fine
3209558 im often asked what i think about as i run i always ponder the question what exactly
3209559 i just run i run in a void or maybe i should put it the other way i run in order to acquire a void but as you might expect an occasional thought will slip into this void peoples minds cant be a complete blank human beings emotions are not strong or consistent enough to sustain a vacuum what i mean is the kinds of thoughts and ideas that invade my emotions as i run remain subordinate to that void lacking content they are just random thoughts that gather around that central void

3209569 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime
3209570 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3209571 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences

3209575 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3209576 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3209577 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3209578 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3209579 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3209580 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3209581 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3209602 the challenges facing the populous in south dakota cross party lines and are eating away at each and every one of our pocket books by a landslide these challenges comprise of access to affordable healthcare livable wages quality education and the burden of ever increasing taxation
3209603 the cost of healthcare has increased four times faster than the median earnings and this has left citizens in a precarious place
3209604 wages are the lowest in the nation in spite of the federal minimum wage outpacing this states minimum
3209605 this states budget is a wreck in spite of continually fleecing citizens with the implementation of higher and additional taxations

3209609 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
3209610 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
3209611 when you are training an elite athlete every aspect of their health and physical skills should be assessed and if possible improved it is critical that every athletes vision is clear and that their vision is helping not hindering their performance
3209612 scientific advances like the achievevision program offer new techniques to help our athletes perform at their peak we have incorporated the achievevision program at general administration of sports of china to allow eye care professionals coaches and trainers to customize vision care for each athlete and focus on the visual skills that are key to their competition

3209618 when you are training an elite athlete every aspect of their health and physical skills should be assessed and if possible improved it is natural to think of nutrition and weight training but traditional training is not enough anymore
3209619 scientific developments like the achievevision program developed by the vision care institute offer new techniques to help our athletes perform at their peak and allow coaches athletes and trainers to ensure vision is helping not hindering their performance the british olympic association has installed the achievevision program equipment at bisham abbey national sports centre with the support of visual performance skills consultant dr sherylle calder to allow eye care professionals coaches and trainers to customize vision care for each athlete

3209628 all he told me was that higher headquarters wanted to be connected to the pilot for a mission the next day and he called the communications squadron because he couldnt think of anyone else to call
3209629 i terminated a network connection cable inside the headset coming from the wire harness and connected it to the conference call terminations on the circuit board inside a vosip phone
3209630 now we dont need to get on our keyboard to type our request or take our eyes off the screen
3209631 we can just talk to the caoc to receive clearance authority to engage a target or get other updates instead
3209632 with the phone people at the caoc are able to call us and use all the communications capabilities available there to feed us real time support through the headset
3209633 i never would have thought that a three star general would know what i did much less think so highly of it
3209634 we do crime scene investigations on bomb sites conducting post blast analysis to help us combat future attacks and track the ied cells where the deadly weapons originate
3209635 it was a little different coming into this environment dominated by soldiers but we are all here for the same reason to serve our country
3209636 i do a lot of analytical work with the army intelligence guys and really enjoy the things i get to do here plus i get to do something for my fellow servicemembers
3209637 there is no real difference between an airman and a soldier we are all professionals and take our work seriously

3209639 i think you ought to look at the relationship of one of constructive engagement where you can find common areas like north korea and iran but also be in a position where they respect you enough to listen to your views on religious freedom and political liberty
3209640 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
3209641 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
3209642 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts
3209643 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
3209644 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser

3209647 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3209648 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3209649 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3209650 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3209651 a war is underway and our colleagues need to listen before consulting with their capitals and making decisions they need to listen to each party
3209652 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
3209653 to be honest we dont give a damn what people think about our music
3209654 this opens more doors for asian americans in the party
3209655 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3209656 the georgian government has accepted the elements of a peace agreement that the russian government previously said it would be willing to accept
3209657 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3209658 it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3209659 kids today have been given everything they want and dont have to work for it they have no respect for authority
3209660 theyll make remarks right to the face of the mall cops i get to the point where i want to do something
3209661 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
3209662 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
3209663 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
3209664 kids want to think for themselves they dont care what mom and dad say
3209665 this was a republican stronghold but its changing very quickly because its mom and dad youre republican so i aint ever going to be one of them
3209666 whats the matter sirius my boy is there an instruction of mine that you dont understand
3209667 not at all professor i was just trying to remember the first three steps while james is getting all the ingredients
3209668 ah thats very good of you sirius five points to gryffindor for thinking ahead and perhaps youd like to stop by for the next slug club meeting this friday
3209669 prongs you know how wormtail and i arent very good at potions right
3209670 well professor slughorn said that this potion is very important for our grade and i dont want to mess it up do you mind if we switch partners peter already has a set of ingredients
3209671 the board says it has to be minced finely exactly three minutes before adding
3209672 alexander said that when he made the potion he accidently added it half a minute early and his potion turned out better than anyone elses
3209673 please hand it in carefully i know you have something that youre planning on dropping into severus cauldron but do it after youve given our potion to professor slughorn
3209674 newts eye it reacts badly with cubed daisy roots and im rather disappointed that it didnt explode
3209675 im disappointed in you the color and texture was perfect when i had walked by just moments ago i thought i told you to collect it
3209676 i suppose thats a zero for the day then severus
3209677 you just said that his potion was perfect not too long ago it isnt fair that you discredit his previous efforts on one mistake
3209678 how can you be sure that it was good there are plenty of combinations that could create that color and texture
3209679 thats a lie black euphoria has a very distinct color thats hard to recreate with any other combination
3209680 why are you sticking up for a slytherin dont you have any house pride
3209681 what about school pride doesnt professor dumbledore tell us at the beginning of each year that there should be friendships between houses and the fewer the enemies the better not that you would know i bet more than half the school is your enemy
3209682 you messed up his potion didnt you i bet thats it you couldnt stand having severus be better than you at something so you went and screwed up his potion
3209683 this is very strange severus did you put it in
3209684 no sir i would never mix an eye of newt into a potion with cubed daisy roots the result would be too disastrous
3209685 the potion did not react unpleasantly until black passed by i believe he may be the cause of the disturbance
3209686 im sorry i hadnt known what would have happened i just thought it would have been amusing
3209687 class is dismissed please carefully make your way to the front of the room no points will be deducted from either house remus please stay for a moment
3209688 especially now that our potion is ruined tell professor mcgonagall that ill be a bit late will you
3209689 remus never got up from his seat i was watching him the entire time he never got up
3209690 not much he wasnt sure who to believe between me and lily so he decided that he would take off twenty points from gryffindor for whoever did do it and hes going to let me redo the potion with severus
3209691 yes and after i explained to him that you were my partner and shouldnt get a zero because of an accident like that he suggested that you join us
3209692 of course i dont need it but youll never pass without my help
3209693 why dont you just tell slughorn that you threw it in and stop pacing
3209694 he said that slughorn would just take more points off for deceit and crap and that wouldnt be fair especially since were already falling behind the other houses especially slytherin
3209695 well what if you could find snivellus partner and have him join you too
3209696 he never has a partner no one ever likes working with the git
3209697 well it cant hurt to work with him tonight right besides maybe if he finds out hes got to deal with you hell go away its not like he actually needs the potion for his grade either
3209698 in fact if youre bad enough he might just leave
3209699 i cant be bad remus will get upset im surprised hes so calm at the moment and i dont want him to start yelling at me besides if i do anything terrible evans is probably going to haul remus up to the girls dormitory just so i cant possibly influence him at all
3209700 be good be so incredibly good and kind and sweet natured that snivellus leaves just because he cant stand your goodness
3209701 think about it what would you do if snivellus was suddenly nice to you wouldnt you think something was underfoot and want to get away from him as fast as possible
3209702 but what if he just accepts that ive changed and shit
3209703 honestly padfoot do you think snivellus would believe that dear old sirius black has taken a turn for the better
3209704 prongs my friend i believe that for once you have an ingenious plan
3209705 since when did you get so chummy with remus that youd do anything for him
3209706 since we decided to elope during christmas remember we told you about our plans to run away from the world and be on our own with no one to bother us especially not you
3209707 how kind of you to join us i was just telling remus and severus here that if they do perfectly on euphoria then the little accident
3209708 ill go get the ingredients then shall i why dont you start the fire remus and you can reread the instructions severus if you didnt take notes from the board earlier i can lend you mine
3209709 honestly remus i was just going to offer him this to wipe his face with
3209710 remus you have to believe me i mean i havent done anything bad all night and ive been more than nice to both of you
3209711 after all ive turned over a new leaf no more pointless pranking for sirius black
3209712 neither of you need the potion for your grade whereas its essential to mine and since it seems as if you two wont get along i think that both of you should leave
3209713 i know that neither of you has done anything wrong
3209714 but youre just being distractions im certain that if it were only one of you here we would be able to work well and create a perfect potion but with both of you im afraid id do better on my own
3209715 and it just isnt fair if i let one stay and the other go you understand right
3209716 fucking hell who the fuck do they think they are
3209717 best not to dwell on these things mate and if you ask me i think you should just ask moony to spend valentines day with you instead of waiting for him to tell you that hes too busy to
3209718 why are you back so late euphoria only needs an hour and a half at most
3209719 i messed up the first time apparently even a brief moment of interruption can ruin the potion so i had to do it again professor slughorn said it was unnesscary but he had also said earlier that if i managed to make the potion perfectly he would raise my grade up by a letter
3209720 but professor slughorn was tired and he said that it was close so if the next potion i make is perfect hell raise the grade like he promised
3209721 so you should have been back half an hour ago
3209722 probably but i figured i had earned a nice bath in the prefects bathroom
3209723 no reason i guess i had to make sure you came back safely and all that
3209724 i wouldnt want my moony to have gone missing because no one had made sure he made his way back from the dungeons safely would i
3209725 its really late sirius and we still have classes tomorrow
3209726 i was just wondering if you had plans for this saturday
3209727 our expanding presence demonstrates our ongoing commitment to cleveland and northeastern ohio we have great confidence in the future economic vitality of this region
3209728 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
3209729 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
3209730 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
3209731 as gay men so much depends on where you live what your social support system is like
3209732 if they really wanted to get my vote they could pitch in at the funnel cake stand to help get the line down
3209733 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3209734 verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
3209735 you are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do

3209738 theyd been out there in the field for three days and they were coming back in for a shower and a good meal
3209739 they solve their symptoms they make them feel good and they essentially want to stay on them forever because once they go off them acid reflux returns
3209740 there may be patients who have very mild symptoms of heartburn who while they get relief from these medications may find they get equally good relief with less aggressive medications
3209741 i get the pains in my bones i can feel the bone pain
3209742 i think the first thing we need to do is stop the medicine altogether
3209743 its amazing that youre trying to take care of one situation and youre causing a problem in another area

3209747 sidney wolfe public citizens general secretary of junk science has just filed a citizens petition with the fda calling for a black box warning on ed medications because of 48 events of naion non arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy a loss of vision that is frequently irreversible
3209748 suggesting that sidney have his eyes examined would only be a partial diagnosis
3209749 has once again failed in this responsibility these drugs need much stronger warnings especially a black box warning such as the one we have proposed
3209750 heres usa today crawling through the mud past janet woodcock who officially speaks for the fda to talk to david graham about avandia
3209751 powerful members of congress want to remake the food and drug administration by giving it broad powers to levy fines order drug recalls and restrict drug industry advertising
3209752 perhaps most importantly they want the next president to appoint a tough fda commissioner completely independent from the industry
3209753 messrs dingell and grassley and their allies have ordered about 20 investigations of drugs and issues involving the fda
3209754 mr grassley began his campaign to overhaul the fda in 2004 during an uproar about the agencys slow reaction to potential links between popular antidepressants and teen suicides
3209755 now he has four staffers and a parade of fda whistleblowers helping him investigate a plethora of fda controversies such as its approval of the antibiotic ketek
3209756 some current and former fda safety reviewers have opened a whistleblower website to air their concerns that fda leaders are pushing them to approve some drugs
3209757 a website launched and operated by current and former us food and drug administration staff who believe public health is being put at unnecessary risk these concerned civil servants and ex civil servants have either experienced or are aware of wrongful directives by us fda upper management directives that put public health at avoidable risk
3209758 interesting omnibus piece from by warren ross of medical marketing amp media on the various slings and arrows being tossed at the worlds premier medical regulatory agency
3209759 weep and whine and try to get decisions made that are based on politics rather than on science
3209760 the motive may be either to get drugs approved or not approved it cuts both ways
3209761 good thing she didnt include this stirring stupak statement from an la times article about why andy von eschenbach sandy kweder janet woodcock and the fdas cafeteria guy should resign
3209762 the drug companies know that this administration will do nothing to them there is no fear of the fda with this culture with laissez faire oversight and regulation i think they should be gone if we get rid of them it will put the drug companies on notice
3209763 heparin hypocrisy hyped up safety fears on adhd drugs does medicaid kill poor people
3209764 yet another show trial held by another congressional committee on the fda there have been four or five over the last two months on heparin alone
3209765 who is gaining momentum along with the fda in shifting the agency towards a science and systems based approach to regulation using real time technology to promote full time compliance has to sit and take the following from the likes of bart stupak d michigan
3209766 last year this nations regulatory failures resulted in dead dogs and cats this year it has tragically led to the deaths of people
3209767 if we dont make some rapid progress on fixing the foreign drug inspection program the next melamine or heparin tragedy will soon be upon us
3209768 coming from a guy who helped push up the suicide rates by scaring parents away from antidepressants and who is pushing for drug importation at a time when al qaeda and hezbollah are involved in drug counterfeiting
3209769 andy must have to shower after sitting through such a show trial
3209770 meanwhile the steve nissen fear factory spews out another piece of tabloid medicine ekg monitoring of all kids getting stimulants for adhd
3209771 now theres a way to achieve nissen who has never studied adhd goal of making a physicians hand quiver before writing a scrip for the drug
3209772 scott gottlieb is a lot of things public servant physician pundit he is my former colleague at the fda most importantly he is my friend
3209773 and my blood boils with anger and frustration at todays scurrilous attack on him in the seattle times
3209774 scott i know personally i know that he takes his work at the fda seriously i know that he takes his government oath to protect the public health seriously i know that he is highly ethical and honest and i know how much this article must hurt him personally
3209775 and im sure that is precisely why certain lupine elements are gleefully forwarding this ugly hit piece to their friends and colleagues
3209776 if people dont agree with his policy positions they should dispute them firmly strongly logically and respectfully
3209777 that they have chosen character assassination only shows the weakness of their intellectual arguments as well as their disappointing lack of character
3209778 new and better way to establish drug safety that solves a one of the more serious problems in drug development namely that animal studies are often a poor and inaccurate substitute for what happens in human
3209779 sid wolfe has opposed every effort to speed drugs to dying patients since he has been on his anti patient jihad starting in 1970
3209780 since his organization makes money by hawking a book worst pills best pills that argues the most drugs are dangerous
3209781 is partially responsible for the decline in ssri prescription use and the corresponding increase in adolescent suicide
3209782 and this guy is head of the health subcommittee why is he being taken seriously why isnt he being held accountable
3209783 ssris have not been proven effective in treating adolescent depression to the contrary their use may actually increase the suicide rate of its young patients
3209784 in response to these reports of increased suicide rates with ssri use fda officials suppressed their own post marketing surveillance prohibited fda employees from discussing the report and launched an investigation to find the person who leaked information to the press today ssris remain on the market without a clear medical benefit to the patient
3209785 there should be a black box warning around everything stupak says regarding medicines
3209786 particularly ssris which have been shown to benefit patients and are associated with a decline in suicides
3209787 dr healy recently testified at the fda hearing on antidepressants he is a psychiatry professor at cardiff university in wales but also according to the new york times has worked for plaintiffs lawyers in cases brought against pharmaceutical companies thats transparency
3209788 when i served as associate commissioner at the fda dr healy visited with me but he never mentioned that he worked for the tort bar
3209789 when i went into the fda to meet with peter pitts i made no efforts to conceal my links to trial attorneys some of whom were at the meeting and no efforts were made to conceal my links to the pharmaceutical industry all of which were well known
3209790 because in my experience republicans such as senator grassley and staffers working for them such as emilia desanto have appeared more concerned about and more effective on the issue than anyone else and as a republican appointee i thought peter pitts heart might be in the right place
3209791 what was not well known at the time was that peter pitts was transiting between working for pharmaceutical companies or perhaps not even transiting
3209792 im not sure how many of us would have felt it worth going if we had known his background
3209793 it seems astonishing to me now that with people like peter pitts in fda that it was ever possible to bring the suicidality issues to light
3209794 and again there is no link to ssris and in increase in suicides rather some unclear evidence based on an unvalidated measure called suicidality that includes just talking about self harm in general
3209795 whose flawed study about ssris and suicide triggered a series of events which lead to less ssri use and more suicide
3209796 the increase amounted to roughly 10 percent and that occurred in a year in which new and controversial black box warnings were added to the labeling on the medications
3209797 for his persistence zeal and determination to damage not only the fda but the public health for his effectiveness in fear mongering and willingness to subordinate medical progress to his ascetic view of safety
3209798 but he seems to spend a lot of time in the halls of congress advising members and staff about which fda medical reviewers should be hauled in for polite conversations
3209799 setting aside dr grahams contribution to the vioxx populi literature which an fda advisory committee considered to be a rather shoddy piece of research he also helped push through the statistical analysis and organize the public outcry over ssris that resulted in a decline in antidepressant use and a corresponding increase in teen suicides
3209800 his assertion that avandia should be taken off the market
3209801 is best remembered in 2007 as the conduit for steve nissens half baked meta analysis of avandia
3209802 helped blow out of all appropriate proportion fear about drug safety in general and avandia in particular
3209803 persistent undermining of the fda came close to winning him clipboard top honors for 2007
3209804 the food and drug administration was also negligent in the vioxx case those running the nations public safety agency repeatedly dismissed the concerns of their own scientists and seemed to do everything possible to keep the public in the dark about emerging problems with vioxx
3209805 i wonder how much more money the senator will get from the trial lawyer lizards as a reward for such vituperative rants
3209806 members of congress and senior officials of the fda should be ashamed of themselves for giving graham the chance to not only rant on about vioxx and ssris but to make the same claims about ketek and drugs for schizophrenia
3209807 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory
3209808 we expect q3 revenues of over 22 million and net income of 650 000 we expect fy08 net income of 1 5 million or 0 03 per share and gross margins in the 36 37 range
3209809 we are also disappointed to see our stock at these levels despite all of the progress we have made we believe that generating growth and solid operating results in our business is the most effective way to increase investment in our stock and raise our price
3209810 we reported our highest second quarter revenue ever we also produced record second quarter operating income of 1 4 million
3209811 companion animal spending has generally been unaffected by economic downturns however every downturn has its own unique characteristics we have been unable to reliably determine any such eefects on our current business with any precision however we do know that two of our major competitors have recently reported q2 results and have noted the negative effect that the economy has had on their business they have reported slower than expected use of consumables we will continue to monitor the industry and we will be conservative as we consider discretionary operating and capital expenditures

3209822 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3209823 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3209824 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation

3209858 were going to rest him and then were going to get him back out here as soon as he can
3209859 hes going to be back im not worried that he will not be back they checked him out at the hospital thats why they kept him overnight so that they can investigate to see if there was anything more than a cut and its nothing more than a cut
3209860 but hes a proven player and a pro bowl player so i know he will work very hard to be back
3209861 you talk to all the players about safety and precaution
3209862 theres an old adage that says an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure so if you adhere to that generally things work pretty good
3209863 so what can you do about it other than try to educate them
3209864 you never want to lose anybody but theres always opportunity and if guys can take advantage of the opportunity generally they can make it in the nfl
3209865 steve missed some ota time because he had a foot injury
3209866 hes coming back from that and hes beginning to pick things up hes beginning to understand where he needs to be
3209867 steve is an extremely hard worker hes a smart guy who can play multiple positions so that helps him
3209868 were going to work him and slowly bring him back
3209869 basically were going to have to go back and start from scratch again give him treatment and bring him along slowly and then add work as he can handle work
3209870 so there is no timetable on him either well just have to see how it goes
3209871 i dont know how much rope hell get because as you get down to the time when you have to cut down your team you have to have guys that will help you
3209872 he did show enough that were definitely interested in seeing how he can come along and hopefully he can get back soon enough to show us that
3209873 this is a start im happy where im at im progressing
3209874 its been frustrating being out i can tell you from experience that its definitely not a fun thing to go through but thats football guys get hurt
3209875 but after missing so much time i just need to practice more and get in better shape
3209876 this is the same offense that we had last year so im up to speed with it mentally i just have to get with it physically
3209877 hes making some progress and were beginning to add to his workload a little bit to see how he can handle it
3209878 if he handles it then we will keep adding and hopefully we will see him out here soon
3209879 look at me no no look at me okay youre cool bff

3209881 si los precios dejan de crecer e incluso decrecen como est sucediendo en este momento y si eso se mantiene en el mediano plazo esa situaci n terminar a afectando los ingresos por exportaciones de la econom a colombiana y en conclusi n podr a aumentar el d ficit en la cuenta corriente
3209882 lo ha hecho por ejemplo acumulando reservas internacionales entonces recibir menores ingresos por la baja de los precios es una consecuencia adversa para las cuentas exteriores de colombia pero que el pa s podr a soportar
3209883 los fondos que especulan en las bolsas de granos han vendido durante lo corrido de agosto un total de 35 500 contratos de futuros que representan 1 4 millones de toneladas de granos esta alta oferta de t tulos tambi n ocasion la baja en los precios
3209884 estamos m s cerca de hacer posible un manto de invisibilidad al haber demostrado que con ese nuevo material se puede doblegar la luz a nuestra voluntad
3209885 por naturaleza estas plazas han sido poco desarrolladas en el pa s hay una gran masa de t cnicos emp ricos pero el talento especializado se ala hall lo hemos tenido que buscar en mercados como argentina venezuela per y chile
3209886 las condiciones c clicas son distintas en uno y otro caso
3209887 all hay una amenaza muy grande de crisis financiera y aqu no pasa eso si el sistema financiero de e u se va se va todo el mundo
3209888 ha creado una mayor incertidumbre en el mercado del crudo siempre muy inestable
3209889 creo que si el conflicto es contenido al norte de georgia el suministro de crudo no se ver afectado
3209890 mercado mira con preocupaci n cualquier se al de que puede haber una escalada del conflicto por ejemplo las declaraciones del vicepresidente estadounidense dick cheney que dijo que la agresi n rusa no debe quedar sin respuesta
3209891 tenemos buenas expectativas para este semestre no tanto por el tema de vivienda sino por el de infraestructura porque cada vez el sector privado y p blico se convencen de la necesidad de mejorarla
3209892 aunque hay algunos subsectores industriales donde la desaceleraci n es evidente veo que algunas empresas de alimentos y comercio a n tienen una demanda buena
3209893 no obedecen a ninguna relaci n de causa y efecto como quiera que las empresas son las que est n movilizando actualmente la carga que se mueve en el pa s pese al paro
3209894 para sancionar a una empresa se necesita demostrar que se niega sistem ticamente a prestar el servicio lo cual estamos seguros no existe como prueba
3209895 el viernes habl con el ministro de transporte quien indic que el fin de semana militarizar an las v as y se escoltar an caravanas de camiones sin embargo tengo reportes de que en lebrija santander los promotores del paro obligaron a seis camiones cargados con cereales a entrar a un parqueadero donde su salida fue bloqueada por otros veh culos
3209896 igual sucedi en loboguerrero valle cuando se esperaba la salida de una caravana en la ma ana de ayer pero le fue imposible porque las llantas de los camiones estaban pinchadas un tercer caso similar a los anteriores est sucediendo en el play n santander donde est n parqueados varios camiones en una estaci n de gasolina cerca de la planta de cementos c mex sin forma de salir
3209897 el paro ha tra do como consecuencia una disminuci n en la producci n de algunos bienes ya que en la parte textil se requiere de algunos accesorios para terminar el producto que solo se consiguen en colombia y no han podido acceder a los mismos porque no hay movilizaci n de mercanc as
3209898 de no recuperarse ese dinero se comprometer a m s del 70 por ciento del patrimonio de las empresas promotoras de salud
3209899 hay un riesgo de colapso del sistema de seguridad social en salud
3209900 desde hace m s de un a o venimos en un proceso de conciliaci n entre las eps y el ministerio pero a la fecha no hay acuerdos
3209901 acemi ha presentado propuestas para agilizar las soluciones que esperamos sean tenidas en cuenta
3209902 pues hay recobros dudosos y esto hay que mirarlo con sumo cuidado ya que se trata de recursos p blicos
3209903 mi posici n es que los pagos de medicamentos y procedimientos deben hacerse a precios de mercado y no con los que algunas eps nos quieran cobrar
3209904 nos interesan eps fuertes y es probable que por el requisito de fortalecimiento patrimonial algunas salgan del sistema
3209905 vamos a permitir crecimiento y productividad a las empresas para instalar soluciones m s competitivas y hacer sus procesos m s r pidamente que sea manejable flexible con soluciones como que si se cay el sistema quede integrado y est debidamente capacitado

3209907 instrumento que permite y facilita el intercambio de saberes bienes y servicios
3209908 lo que hemos querido es impulsar esas ra ces y saberes del pueblo para que est plasmada en la ley y as poder apoyar a todas esas comunidades que mantienen este tipo de saberes y as impulsar estas tradiciones
3209909 ser administrada y s lo tendr valor dentro del mbito territorial de su localidad por los grupos de intercambio solidario debidamente registrados y distribuida equitativamente la cual no tiene curso legal ni circular en el territorio de la rep blica
3209910 la existencia de dos precios para un mismo bien crea incentivos para el arbitraje puede ocurrir que un bien comprado con monedas comunales se venda luego en bol vares fuera del mercado
3209911 en estos momentos supone el dos por ciento del producto interno bruto pib venezolano para llevarlo a cifras como en italia donde representan el 30 por ciento
3209912 hay una gran diferencia entre sentirse seguro y estar seguro

3209919 el reto m s grande no es lograr la desmovilizaci n de estas personas sino que con los aportes de la sociedad civil y el gobierno se beneficien por igual pobres v ctimas de la violencia y desmovilizados
3209920 el monto ideal que se pod a haber invertido eran unos 800 millones de d lares mientras el m nimo que se ha invertido es un 10 por ciento
3209921 esos precios han empezado a bajar existe un riesgo de que se produzca una sobreoferta mundial de petr leo y esto pudiera afectar los ingresos del estado en 2009
3209922 la baja de los t tulos se produjo porque el mercado interpret como una se al negativa la tasa de inter s pagada por el bono que compr el gobierno de venezuela
3209923 el valor de algunas de las especies de t tulos nacionales se encuentra tan injustificadamente deprimido que el gobierno obtendr a un ahorro de servicios de deuda de casi 25 d lares por cada 100 d lares invertidos s lo tomando en consideraci n vencimientos del corriente ejercicio
3209924 en nada se corresponde con la solidez de las variables econ micas y sociales que rigen en el pa s
3209925 ya hemos discutido el tema con coldeportes y hay una oportunidad de oro si los clubes se mantienen como sociedades sin nimo de lucro est n dejando de ganar mucho dinero y hay voluntad por parte del gobierno con el proyecto de ley para que se conviertan en sociedades an nimas adem s viene el mundial sub 20 en el 2011 que requiere fuertes inversiones
3209926 una de las claves es ver al f tbol como negocio
3209927 no se trata nicamente de los ingresos por entradas a los partidos y la venta de jugadores las oportunidades est n tambi n en los negocios que se generan alrededor de un partido de f tbol
3209928 lo principal es la taquilla pero no es lo nico un aficionado que va a un estadio hace otro tipo de consumos entre ellos el parqueadero comida y art culos como gorras camisetas llaveros entre otros
3209929 adem s hay una cadena de sucesos relacionados con el f tbol que generan valor unos a otros por ejemplo con buenas inversiones un equipo podr ser m s competitivo y mejorar sus resultados deportivos esto generar mayor afluencia de hinchas a los estadios y aumentar el inter s por transmitir los encuentros
3209930 estos son asuntos que generan valor al inversionista y que no se han explotado hasta ahora sin embargo todo requiere fuertes inversiones en el mediano y largo plazo
3209931 muchas firmas tienen el sue o de que llegue otra m s grande y la compre eso se podr a hacer por medio de una opa
3209932 como pas con ecopetrol queremos tener capital de inversionistas de peso y de gente del com n esta es una buena opci n para seguir abriendo las puertas del mercado de valores
3209933 el monto establecido como aporte inicial o capital suscrito deber mantenerse durante el funcionamiento de la sociedad toda vez que su disminuci n constituir una causal de disoluci n

3209943 i have documented it for a while but recently i realized i can do something about it

3209945 it is important to check voltage compatibility as some cards incorrectly have dual notches and some motherboards incorrectly have fully open slots furthermore some poorly designed older 3 3 v cards incorrectly have the 1 5 v key inserting a card into a slot that does not support the correct signaling voltage may cause damage

3209948 incorporate a domestic gas phase as part of our foundation project
3209949 under our state agreement with the wa government we were initially planning to submit a proposal for development of a 300 tj per day domestic gas plant by 31 december 2010 but we now plan to accelerate this to coincide with our development proposals to government for the lng phase
3209950 that means when we consider fid final investment decision we will consider fid for both lng and domestic gas with the domestic gas plant ready for start up to coincide at or around the commissioning of the projects third lng train
3209951 bringing on gorgons domestic gas phase earlier will increase the number of supply points for domestic gas into wa and has been welcomed by the state government

3209957 lingkaran pentacle harus digambar dengan lingkaran sempurna kalau tidak bisa berbahaya buatmu nanti
3209958 kau kan bisa baca baca deh nanti aku tinggal ngulang
3209959 kalau aku membaca mantranya rohku akan memakan intinya sendiri dalam proses pembebasan dan itu berbahaya

3209961 ada janji sama clara mau nganter dia ke pesta ulang tahun temen
3209962 baik selama kau disini kita harus memanfaatkan waktu semaks mal mungkin untuk mencari
3209963 ia hanya memintaku menjaga gudang miliknya waktu pertama kali memanggilku ia masih jadi shaman pemula aku bahkan membuatnya kencing di celana ketika pertama kali menampakkan wujudku
3209964 seiring waktu ia terus berkembang sehingga menjadi ahli dan semakin ahli terakhir kali aku bertemu dengannya saat ia memanggil sesosok afrit besar dan menjadikannya pengawal pribadinya selain itu ia juga berhasil menjebak homonoculus dengan mudah dan meramalkan kelahiran bangsa kalian ini
3209965 ajaran agama yang mempercayai adanya dua dewa dewa terang ahuramazda atau ormuz dan dewa kegelapan ahriman atau angro mainyu
3209966 mereka dua afrit yang dipanggil oleh zarathustra sendiri tapi karena kebodohannya ia malah menganggap dua afrit itu sebagai dewa
3209967 dan ini agatha kawanku selama ini ia satu satunya yang dapat kuajak bicara disini selain kau
3209968 ya seorang di ujung cahaya waktu itu berkata aku masih punya sesuatu yang belum selesai dan itu adalah menjawab teka teki yang diberikan ayahku sebelum kebakaran besar di rumah kami
3209969 kalau aku saja tak tahu mana mungkin otakmu yang kecil itu tahu
3209970 tidak tapi aku punya 3 abad pengalaman dibanding 18 tahun pengalaman dari hidupmu yang singkat
3209971 haha jadi kurasa kau tak perlu bantuanku untuk membebaskan ikatanmu disini
3209972 demon apapun bentuknya adalah mahkluk licik dan jahat mereka akan melukaimu jika bisa mengerti
3209973 jangan biarkan demon manapun bahkan yang nanti aku kenalkan untuk mengetahui namamu
3209974 kok kau hobi sekali sih terjun bebas kedalam empang bau dan berlumpur dengan bokong terbakar
3209975 ya begitulah para shaman itu hari ini memanggil dua afrit dan enam jinn keadaan makin bertambah kacau kawan
3209976 sepertinya sih begitu eh ngomong ngomong siang ini beberapa kawan masterku berkumpul bersama dan berusaha memanggil marid
3209977 sayangnya mereka gagal andai saja berhasil kemenangan pasti berada di pihak kami
3209978 bagaimana kalau kita mangsa saja mereka anak itu untukmu dan si arwah gadis itu untukku aku butuh tambahan tenaga kawan
3209979 gerok kau tahu kalau kita tak dapat mengucapkan mantra itu tanpa tewas terlebih dulu kan
3209980 apa kau gila aku tak dapat membantumu masalah itu kami tak sederajat ingat aku budak disini
3209981 aku berencana akan membuat cermin pengintai dan memata matai mastermu saat ia merapalkan mantra pembebasan
3209982 masalahnya kau tetap butuh mantra pengikat yang harus dipelajari untuk membuat cermin pengintai dan itu juga bukan perkara mudah
3209983 ada mantra pengikat dalam bahasa germania atau coptic yang dapat kuajarkan padanya sisanya tinggal melihat perkembangan mastermu
3209984 hm kurasa level 13 terhitung ia mampu memerintah sembilan imp dan tiga foliot dalam waktu bersamaan
3209985 so aku tak ingin berlama lama disini aku akan menderita cacar merah membakar jika tak kembali setelah senja
3209986 tenang saja aku selalu mendarat ditempat yang sama keadaan yang sama setiap hari
3209987 so sekarang kita tahu apa yang harus dilakukan jadi mari mulai
3209988 ikut saja kita pecahkan teka teki sial mu itu sembari mengajari anak ini cara membuat cermin pengintai
